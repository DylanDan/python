(NYSE:STI) Q1 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call April 21, 2017  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Ankur Vyas - Director of Investor Relations", "Bill Rogers - Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer", "Aleem Gillani - Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Executive Vice President", "Analysts", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "John McDonald - Bernstein", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC", "Michael Rose - Raymond James", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Stephen Scouten - Sandler O'Neill", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the SunTrust first quarter conference call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.", "I would now line to turn the conference over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thank you Cynthia. Good morning and welcome to SunTrust first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during the call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com. With me today, among other members of our executive management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, investors.suntrust.com. Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit, nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks Ankur and good morning everybody. I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I am going to turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I will conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and investment thesis and how this strategy is enhanced by our recent organizational changes.", "We reported $0.91 of our earnings per share this quarter, which after excluding $0.04 of tax-related benefits was up 4% compared to the prior year. At a high level, the financial performance we delivered this quarter is a direct result of investing in ourselves to strengthen our client franchise and create a business mix that delivers consistent results in different macroeconomic environments. This has been and will continue to be a key driver of our success.", "More specifically, this quarter we had yet another record for investment banking income. Our investments in SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and the broader wholesale banking platform continued to deliver results and it's clear that our teammates are becoming increasingly effective at working together to deliver the breadth of our capabilities to new and existing clients. Additionally, mortgage servicing, a business we grew deliberately over the past several years, was up $33 million sequentially, which more than offset the decline in mortgage production. Further, our recent acquisition of Pillar provided us approximately $20 million of incremental revenue complementing our traditional CRE lending business.", "And lastly, our ongoing investments in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are delivering profitable growth. These growth initiatives coupled with benefits from an improved interest rate environment and our focus on optimizing the balance sheet drove a 3% sequential and a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue.", "As anticipated, expenses increased sequentially, driven primarily by a seasonal uptick in employee benefits related cost. In addition, we are making further investments in technology throughout the company to improve the client experience and drive future efficiency. As a result, our tangible efficiency ratio increased from the fourth quarter to 64.6% but was slightly better than our own expectations and we fully expect to achieve the efficiency ratio target we set for ourselves this year.", "Overall, asset quality remained strong, stable and well within our guidance. Energy related losses declined further, which drove the reduction in the net charge-offs and non-performing loans. We continue to maintain underwriting discipline across the company in addition to ensuring a consistent focus on portfolio diversity, both of which will result in further capital efficiency from a strong starting point of 9.5% Common Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis.", "So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Aleem who is going to provide some more details on this quarter's performance.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks Bill and good morning everybody and thank you for joining us this morning. I will start on slide four and cover our net interest margin, which increased nine basis points as a result of the steeper yield curve, which positively impacted the securities portfolio and mortgage yields and the increase in contractual short-term rates. The typical first quarter day count effect also positively contributed three basis points to the sequential improvement in margin.", "Net interest income increased 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year as a result of higher rate balance sheet growth and our continued focus on optimizing loan mix. Looking to the second quarter, we expect the net interest margin to increase by a further one to two basis points. This is lower than the first quarter increase as the benefits from lower premium amortization expense and day counts will not repeat. We will continue to manage through a moderately asset sensitive balance sheet while being cognizant of opportunities to add duration if the yield curve steepens.", "Moving on the slide five. You will see that non-interest income increased 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Investment banking had another record quarter and was up $45 million sequentially and $69 million year-over-year as our wholesale banking teammates did an outstanding job in helping clients capitalize upon strong market conditions. Growth was broad based across the entire CIB platform, though particularly strong in syndicated finance and M&A. As Bill mentioned earlier, the consistent growth of our CIB business is a reflection of both the investments we have been making for many years and the one team approach that wholesale delivering to our clients.", "Mortgage related income increased by $8 million sequentially as the anticipated declines in production income were more than offset by a $33 million increase in servicing income, which benefited from lower decay expense and recent portfolio acquisitions. As you saw this quarter, our strategic growth of the servicing portfolio, which is up 16% over the last two years, has diversified our revenue mix and resulted in a more balanced mortgage business.", "Lastly, I note that we have introduced a new line item in the income statement for commercial real estate related income, which is comprised of the fee income from Pillar & Cohen Financial, SunTrust Community Capital and Structured Real Estate, the latter two of which were previously recorded in other non-interest income. Pillar's integration into SunTrust is going very well and the driver of the sequential decline is simply due to the normal variability of SunTrust Community Capital where activity is typically higher in the fourth quarter.", "Let's take a look at expenses on slide six. Non-interest expense increased $68 million this quarter, driven entirely by a $90 million increase in personnel expense as a result of the typical seasonal increases in FICA and 401k costs in addition to the acquisition of Pillar. We also recorded $19 million of costs related to ongoing efficiency initiatives in other non-interest expense, which is about $10 million higher than normal. These increases were partially offset by declines in most other expense categories particularly markets", "Compared to the prior year, our expense base grew 11% as a result of four primary factors. Our improved business and stock price performance, investments we continue to make in talent and technology, higher FDIC premiums and higher net occupancy costs as a result of lower amortized gains from prior sale leaseback transactions. As a reminder, both FDIC premium expense and occupancy costs stepped up in the third quarter of 2016 and have been generally stable since then.", "Separately, while our higher stock price did result in elevated incentive costs in the first quarter compared to a year ago, it also resulted in a tax benefit. The benefit is the amount by which the tax deductions for stock-based compensation exceeded the book deduction. As you can imagine, RSUs that invested in Q1 had a large amount of appreciation over the book expense due to the significant increase in our stock price over the last six months. Previously, this benefit would have been recorded directly to equity, but new accounting standards require these adjustments to be recorded in the provision for income taxes. All else equal, I expect this quarter's expenses to be the high watermark for the year. For the remainder of 2017, the expense base will decline as a result of lower employee benefits costs in addition to our ongoing efficiency initiatives.", "Moving to slide seven where you see the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6% which is up relative to the fourth quarter given normal seasonal patterns in our business and as Bill noted is actually slightly better than our internal expectations. Given this combined with our positive revenue momentum and the ongoing efficiency initiatives we have underway, we remain on track to achieve our goals of having a tangible efficiency ratio of between 61% and 62% for this year and sub-60% by 2019.", "Moving on to slide eight. Our asset quality metrics improved further this quarter evidenced by the six basis point decline in net charge-offs and four basis point decline in non-performing loans and as anticipated, the ALLL ratio was relatively stable. Overall, we continue to expect the net charge-off ratio to remain within a range of 30 to 40 basis points for the full year and for provision expense to approximate net charge-offs, although there will always be some quarterly variability.", "Let's take a look at the balance sheet on slide nine. Average loans increased 1% sequentially, primarily due to growth in C&I and consumer. Period end loans were flat as declines in home equity and C&I were offset by the continued growth in consumer lending. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $5.2 billion or 4% with growth across most categories. In particular, our targeted investments in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are driving solid loan growth and also improving our return profile as the weighted average yield of our consumer portfolio is obviously higher than our commercial portfolio.", "Bigger picture, our clients are optimistic as evidenced by the results of SunTrust's recent Business Pulse Survey where 75% of our clients feel their own outlook is strong and many cite tax reform, infrastructure spending and reduced regulatory burden as catalysts for economic growth and their momentum. As clarity on these fronts develops, we believe our clients will be ready to invest and we are extremely well positioned to meet their needs, given the investments we have made in our business combined with our presence in the higher growth Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.", "Turning to deposits on slide 10. Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across most products and businesses. Our successful deposit growth strategy is the result of our commitment to meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and ultimately our teammates in both the consumer and wholesale banking segments. Deposit betas remain low, which is a reflection of the relatively low interest rate environment and our strong retail deposit mix. Over time, deposit betas will normalize though we will continue to keep our consistent focus on maximizing the value proposition for our clients outside of rate pay.", "Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 9.5%, up about 10 basis points from the prior quarter, even after we successfully returned some of our excess capital to our owners in the form of our normal $240 million quarterly buyback combined in Q1 with an incremental $174 million share repurchase. We submitted our 2017 capital plan earlier this month and look forward to sharing our results with you in late June. At a high level, our strong capital position, particularly in the context of our risk profile combined with additional capital stack optimization should allow us to continue to increase payouts to our owners.", "Moving to the segment overviews, let's begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on slide 12 where we are seeing solid revenue momentum. This has been largely driven by net interest income, which was up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth and further balance sheet optimization. We continue to make good progress in our consumer lending businesses as the direct result of investments to improve our capabilities and enhance the client experience. Consumer loan balances excluding home equity are up 16% year-over-year, which is meaningful in both the context of the company's overall growth trajectory and our return profile. Strong deposit growth continues to be another key contributor to CPWM's revenue momentum with average balances up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year.", "Our ability to grow deposits, while reducing the size of our branch network, which is down 6% year-over-year is a testament to both the strength of our franchise and our clients' continued evolution toward a digitally centered banking experience. We are aware of the importance of having a differentiated and integrated client experience across traditional and digital channels and have consequently made significant investments in each of these areas. In fact, this quarter, we introduced a new and improved mobile banking app and enhanced our online banking platform in order to increase its connectivity to our mortgage offering. In addition, we introduced a digital conversation guide for our branch teammates to help them better track and meet client needs.", "Non-interest income declined 4% sequentially as a result of seasonal declines in service charges and card fees. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income was down 2% due entirely to the posting order changes implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "In wealth management, we continue to make a strategic shift from more of a transaction oriented business to providing management solutions for our clients. This has had a negative impact on recent retail investment income growth trends, but provides for better long-term growth and stability for our clients and our business. Consequently, wealth management related income was stable, both sequentially and year-over-year as growth in AUM was offset by the implications of this shift.", "Expenses in CPWM increased 8% compared to the prior year, largely as a result of the investments we have been making in our digital and consumer lending capabilities, higher FDIC and occupancy costs and increased costs and charges related to branch closures. At a high level, we are pleased with the momentum across CPWM. Consumer lending is producing consistently strong growth. Deposits continue to grow meaningfully. Private wealth management is demonstrating better momentum. And our investments in an improved client experience and more effective branch network will further strengthen our franchise.", "As you see on slide 13, wholesale banking delivered record revenue, in part due to strong capital markets conditions but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we are having with our clients. Revenues were up 6% sequentially and 16% year-over-year primarily due to investment banking's record performance. Growth in investment banking was broad based across most product and client segments, a great indicator that our teammates across the platform are gaining further traction and expanding and deepening client relationships and meeting the capital markets needs of all wholesale banking clients.", "More specifically, M&A, a business which takes a long time to develop and has been a key area of investment for us, had a record quarter. Another proof point that our clients increasingly view us as a trusted strategic advisor. Syndicated finance also had a record quarter. While strong market conditions were a key driver, we also saw continued growth in our commercial and CRE client segments, which contributed to roughly a quarter of a sequential increase. Total lead left relationships are up 9% year-over-year and our average fee per transaction continues to increase. Both of these are direct reflections of our success in strengthening client relationships.", "Net interest income was also a key contributor to the strong revenue growth, up 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as a result of improved loan yields and continued deposit growth. Non-interest expense was up 17% compared to the prior year as a result of higher compensation tied to strong revenue growth and our higher stock price, ongoing investments in technology and the acquisition of Pillar. Pillar's financial contribution in the first quarter was very much in line with our expectations with approximately $20 million of revenue and efficiency ratio in the 80s and an ROA that was accretive to the rest of the company. Pillar, combined with our recent introduction of a longer-term financing product continues to enhance the capabilities of our CRE business.", "Overall, our value proposition in the wholesale banking business is clear. We deliver a full suite of product capabilities and industry expertise with a one team approach to middle market and mid-corporate clients. This value proposition continues to resonate with our clients and the momentum across the wholesale business remains strong.", "Moving the slide 14. We benefited from our diverse revenue mix within the mortgage segment this quarter as the anticipated decline in production income was offset by higher servicing income. Production income was down sequentially and year-over-year as a result of lower refinance activity, though purchase activity remains strong with applications up 26% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Servicing income increased $33 million sequentially, driven by lower decay expense and a larger servicing portfolio. Net income was up $4 million sequentially, driven by higher servicing income. Compared to the prior year, net income was down $21 million as a result of lower revenue and a larger reserve release last year.", "To conclude, let me remind you that we previously announced our strategic decision to integrate our mortgage business with the broader consumer segment and thus mortgage financials will be incorporated into a consolidated consumer segments slide within the July earnings presentation. We will continue to report residential mortgage production income and servicing income as components of non-interest income in the consolidated financials.", "So with that, let me turn it over back to Bill for some concluding remarks.", "Bill Rogers", "Okay. Thanks Aleem. So to conclude, I want to point to slide 15 which highlights how this quarter's performance aligned with our overall investment thesis. So first, we have made targeted investments in growing our client businesses and diversifying our revenue mix over the last several years. These investments coupled with the improving interest rate environment helped drive strong 7% year-over-year revenue growth. A little more specifically our investments in consumer lending helped offset lower growth in other areas while also enhancing returns, consumer private wealth and wholesale delivered strong 6% and 7% year-over-year deposit growth respectively as a result of our focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payments needs and our 10-year plus investments in talent and capabilities across SunTrust Robinson Humphrey continue to lead to deeper client relationships and significant revenue growth.", "In addition, we have made and continue to make meaningful investments in technology to modernize our infrastructure and deliver differentiated experiences which embody our purpose, meet evolving client needs and position us for growth. In the first quarter specifically, we enhanced our consumer digital capabilities, added small business banking to our new wholesale loan origination platform, upgraded our treasury management mobile capabilities and began to conduct test of robotic process automation across mortgage and wholesale lending.", "While these investments have the potential to create further efficiencies, they are first and foremost about delivering improved client experience with strong executional excellence. Going forward, our opportunity set is significant and we will make further investments in enhancing the client experience. As Aleem noted earlier, effective April 3, we integrated our mortgage segment with consumer banking and private wealth management to create a new consumer segment under Mark Chancy's leadership. Mark and the team already have significant momentum on which to build and we expect to create a more consistent integrated and improved experience for our clients across all consumer products and services, somewhat akin to the integrated ecosystem Mark and his leadership teams developed in our wholesale banking business.", "Hugh Cummins will succeed Mark as the leader for wholesale, both most recently led the commercial and business banking line of business and previously led SunTrust Robinson Humphrey from 2008 to 2013. He has been a key contributor to the momentum that SunTrust has established in wholesale and I have no doubt that he and his team will not miss a beat in delivering the distinct value proposition they have spent over a decade in building.", "Second, we have demonstrated consistent efficiency improvements and have plans to accomplish even more. Tom Freeman is now the Efficiency & Strategic Partnerships Executive allowing us to provide more executive focus on large scale efficiency opportunities in addition to evaluating further FinTech alliances and growth opportunities. Tom's focus here gives more confidence in our ability to achieve both our short-term and long-term efficiency objectives.", "Lastly, our capital position remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.5%. This is even more notable when juxtaposed against our risk profile where SunTrust demonstrates amongst the lowest levels of capital erosion in severely adverse economic scenarios relative to peer banks. This strong risk-adjusted capital position gave us confidence to repurchase a total of $414 million of common shares in the first quarter in addition to submitting a capital plan that would result in further increased payouts and financial confidence to you, our owners.", "So before we conclude, I would be remiss not to mention that SunTrust Park, the new home of the Atlanta Braves opened last weekend. This is the start of a 25-year partnership and we are already thrilled with the brand exposure it offers, both regionally and nationally. But this is much more than a name in a ball park. This investment allows our bank to reach more people and fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial wellbeing through programs that we will activate as well as SunTrust Onsite Center called The onUp Experience. There we will engage fans to learn more about gaining financial confidence with fun and interactive baseball activities while also strengthen our brand as a purpose driven client-first company.", "So with that, I will now turn it back over to Ankur and we will begin the Q&A portion.", "Ankur Vyas", "Cynthia, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I would like to ask all participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and only one follow-up in order that we can accommodate as many of you as possible.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Ryan Nash", "Hi. Good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "Bill, maybe I will just start with expenses. You noted that they are going to decline from this quarter. So I just want to make sure I got the guidance right. Will they decline each subsequent quarter? And then I guess related to that, I think the presentation noted that you are going to be closing another 3% of branches this quarter. Should we expect to see similar repositioning costs in the second quarter? And is that baked into your expense guidance?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. Ryan, first let me say and you know, as Aleem said, we sort of start with thinking about efficiency ratio on a year-over-year basis versus a quarter-to-quarter basis. So while we were up in the first quarter and overall, some of that element was due to expenses supporting our revenue growth and then some was episodic and idiosyncratic to FDIC posting order, stock price appreciation, Pillar, a lot of things that Aleem's already referred to as well as our core tenet to continue to invest in our strategic platform.", "But as Aleem said, what we said is as it relates to this quarter, that's the high watermark for both dollars and percent for this year, I mean bar anything that we can't anticipate. And whether it's a quarter-to-quarter, we will have some fluctuations. Some of that will be dependent upon revenue. I don't anticipate a lot more on the branch side. We have sort of done the, as you noted, we have got the 3%. We took most of the cost related to that in the first quarter.", "I don't anticipate an additional charge related to branch closures and the additional plan that we have. And so factoring all of that in, including the rate hikes, we are ahead of where we thought we were. So if we look at our own planning, right now although the number seems higher, we are ahead of where we thought we were and our confidence in getting to that 61% to 62% is very strong.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. And then maybe if I can ask one to Aleem. Aleem, maybe if you could just talk about what's built into the net interest margin in terms of further rate hikes? I think you had said last quarter, June and December. So how should we think about the margin for the remainder of 2017 if the forward curve proves to be correct?", "Aleem Gillani", "All right. Yes. We had originally been thinking that rate increases for 2017 would be due in December given the March increase. We think that's a little bit of a pull forward and maybe June and December now looks something like March and September. So that will help a little bit on a full-year basis. As we said for Q2, we do expect we will get another one or two basis points in NIM in addition to the 9% that we delivered in Q1. And if I try to look sort of full year overall, we then participated one more anticipated rate hike later this year. You know we are normally conservative in the way we think about rate hikes, but we are including that one in. If I think about the full year NIM, what that's going to look like, right now we are thinking that will kind of average probably something like 3.10% or so full year.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open", "John McDonald", "Hi. Good morning. Aleem, just a follow-up on the NIM comments there. Could you just remind us, you mentioned deposit betas remain low, what exactly are you seeing in terms of deposit betas on the retail and commercial? And what kind of beta is baked into your rate sensitivity disclosures when you look ahead?", "Aleem Gillani", "What we incorporate in our modeling, when you take a look at our asset sensitivity that you see in the release what we normally incorporate in our modeling there is kind of a full through the cycle beta so that long-term investors get a good sense of what that's going to look like over the long term. And what we are thinking there pull through the cycle is about a 50 or so beta full company full cycle. Obviously, we have been able to hold the line on liability costs so far and provide our clients with a value proposition that they see from us that's not just based on rate. The differentiation between business clients and consumer clients is apparent.", "Business clients, as you can imagine, with large dollars to deposit are normally more sensitive on betas that are a little bit higher. As I look forward to the rest of the year, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw overall betas for the company in that kind of 25 or so range for the remainder of this year and climbing through 18 to 19 If we get something that looks like the forward curve and if we get sort of measured pace of rate increases from the Fed. All of this is dependent on timing of rate hikes, the competitive environment, obviously and to some extent the steepness of the curve.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, just on the loan growth side. You posted some good C&I growth in a tough quarter for the industry. What are you seeing in terms of the C&I loan demand dynamics? And where does SunTrust see opportunities to grow loans this year, even if the industry trends remain sluggish?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. I will take that. I think the good news is that it's highly diversified. So I can't point to one area and say this was a particular area that accounted for the high percentage of the growth. It's really related to all the investments we have made and the strategies that we have put in place and I think directly correlated to what you see on the fee based side because that's also evidence of the advice that we are giving clients. And I think that results in stronger asset growth. As you know, we don't manage to loan outstandings as a benchmark. We look at production. We look at paydowns, utilization and pipelines and there's some ups and downs related to all that, but all of that put together keeps us being fairly optimistic about where we can go.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. John, as I said in my comments, the SunTrust Business Pulse Survey that we did with our business clients came back with very positive results with many of our clients, 75% feeling really positive about their business. And just yesterday, we received the results of our CRE survey where we surveyed 200 CEOs of CRE clients and that was also very positive with many of them thinking that given the message that they are hearing from DC and then expectations that the administration will be able to deliver on some of those promises, that their growth prospects in 2017, 2018 and 2019 look very good.", "Bill Rogers", "All that being said, we have to reflect on, there is still a bit of a wait and see out there and I don't think that's illogical whether it's tax or healthcare regulation reform. And you saw the market react pretty quickly to some comments related to tax reform. So I think there's still a little bit of wait and see out there and we will look to the next quarters as it relates to a potential inflection point.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open", "Matt O'Connor", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Hi Matt.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi Matt.", "Matt O'Connor", "I was hoping to drill down on the expenses a little bit. I think you said on an absolute basis it will decline from here through the rest of the year and just wanted to get a little more color in terms of the drivers of that? And then specifically, it seems like the cost might have been a little inflated within the consumer segment this quarter, not only the branch cost that you called out, but maybe some other stuff as well. So just trying to get a little more clarity on the cost overall and then specifically on the consumer side of things.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Matt, the Q1 is typically the high watermark for us anyway. So the primary reason for that in Q1 is employee benefits cost, FICA and 401k. And the majority of the decline therefore from Q1 is actually going to be that bump up in benefits cost going away. Having said that, as you pointed out, there will be other costs that I think will be removed over the course of the year.", "We have several efficiency initiatives that are underway. As Bill said, the effect of branch closure cost has primarily been taken early. They are still going to be a couple million here and there over the course of the year but nothing as significant as we saw in the first quarter.", "And some of our other efficiency initiatives are in the space of third-party management vendor costs. We have got some work going on in the area of telecommunications costs. So we expect that as those initiatives come to fruition over the course of the year that a lot of those costs will disappear.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. And then just any comment on full year expenses? I know you have given us this efficiency ratio, but as you think on an absolute basis, cost decline from here? Any sense on what they might look like on a full year basis?", "Bill Rogers", "For full-year basis, we are very focused on the efficiency of the company. And we are happy to be able to note five straight years of improved efficiency at SunTrust. And looking forward for the remainder of 2017, I fully expect that at the end of this year we will have a sixth straight year of efficiency improvement.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. All right. It's very clear. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is helping.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning Geoff.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Good morning. The continued growth in indirect, I am guessing, driven by auto. And kind of curious there, is there an opportunity opening up as some of the other banks pull back?", "Aleem Gillani", "I think if you are looking at year-over-year growth, Geoff, it's a little bit deceiving because of the base from last year. You will recall that what we have been doing with indirect over the last several years is when we see opportunities to manage our overall asset base, we have been a regular seller or securitizer of non-core or low ROA indirect auto loans. And in 3Q last year, we securitized $1 billion. So after that decline in 3Q, if you are looking at year-over-year numbers, naturally you will see growth as a result of that sale. But having said that, when we take a look at our indirect auto right now at the end of Q1, I am pleased actually that our overall weighted average FICO for indirect auto loans is slightly up and our overall LTV on indirect auto loans are slightly down. So if I look at the quality of our indirect auto book, I think right now it's actually pretty good.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. And maybe just to embellish that is, we are not leaning in on indirect. There are places where we are very specifically leaning in on consumer lending and commercial and other areas. And what we are doing with indirect is making sure that supports our overall businesses. And we play in that prime to superprime area as a Aleem noted. So we see it as just a good continuation of our strategy.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thanks. And then just following up on auto. I know within LightStream, you have got a pretty significant contribution from auto, most of it unsecured. Can you give us a bit more detail on the nature of the products and the size of the opportunity there?", "Bill Rogers", "The nature of the products in LightStream, yes. They are made up of a number of different types of loans.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Unsecured auto, I guess is what I wanted to focus on.", "Bill Rogers", "It is. Yes. So we have got unsecured auto there. We also have secured auto and other types of products that we have got on LightStream are unsecured and secured non-auto loans and then we also have debt consolidation loans. So across the board, looking at the composition, I don't have in my head exactly how much is auto versus non-auto, but the total amount of the LightStream portfolio now, Geoff, is $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. The unsecured for auto is superprime part of the portfolio. Average FICO in LightStream is 770 something. It's a high prime, superprime product, particularly in that unsecured area. And overall portfolio yield north of five.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, Ken.", "Ken Usdin", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about credit which, as you mentioned, is in your ranges and you are not expecting to have to build a release much from here. But there was a credit out there that was pretty fairly public. I know you don't talk about singular credits out there, but just in the context of, did you see any lumpiness still in C&I, because I am noticing just a big decline in NPA still? And there just doesn't seem to be anything filling the bucket behind. So could you first just talk about any lumpiness that we are starting to see here on the C&I side, if at all?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, in C&I, obviously that book is lumpy by nature and so there is going to be some lumpiness as individual credits deteriorate over the course of the year. As you said, Ken, we don't reference clients by name, but you know us. We are pretty conservative and if we see credit deterioration in a name, we are going to react. So you can expect that if there is an action that we needed to have been taken in the first quarter, we would have taken it.", "Ken Usdin", "Understood. Well put. And then second, my follow-up just on, also on the consumer side, you have always pointed out that there is this nice lag between the residential delinquency and charge-offs on those debt side of the book. And so can you just talk a little bit about how much more extra benefit you might still have ahead on the resi side? And then just anything to note on the consumer side, just given some of the newer growth and seasoning there? Thanks guys.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. I think most of the benefit in resi, Ken, has come through. Over the last several years, the quality of both our home equity and mortgage books has been pristine and we have enjoyed the advantage of that type of really high quality origination. But most of the decline in reserves that had been built in previous years has been taken. If your question is leading to where we expect the allowance to go overall, I would think that the allowance ratio for the company would be generally pretty stable within a few basis points of where we are now. And you have seen that stability from us in the last few quarters. I would expect that to continue for the remainder of the year.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. Thanks Aleem.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning George.", "Gerard Cassidy", "I think it was back in 2014, you guys started a program for the capital markets part of your company to go after customers that were not CIB customers. Could you tell us, in this quarter what percentage of the business is coming from non-CIB? And how is that trending since you implemented that plan?", "Aleem Gillani", "I will tell you that we provide capital market services to all of our wholesale clients, including those in our commercial banking area and those in our CRE area. So we look at our clients kind of holistically and we approach them as one team with all of the products that they are going to need, whether those are loans or capital market services. If you look at our results this quarter in the context of over an industry loan growth that's not growing, you see that our capital markets business did particularly well and that's because we were able to provide both corporate and commercial clients with the capital market services they need. We don't really break down in detail externally how much of that comes from CRE and commercial clients, but if you want to think about at a high level, 15% to 20% of capital markets revenues come from commercial and CRE as well as private wealth clients in the context of the total.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. I would say that overall strategy is a key part of our growth dynamic going forward. Quarter-to-quarter, it's going to fluctuate. So this quarter, a little down in commercial, but it was up in CRE, as an example. So just quarter-to-quarter it might fluctuate and year-over-year it's up substantially and at the numbers that Aleem was talking about.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. And then a bigger picture question. We all know the industry has changed dramatically in the last 20 years, more capital, higher efficiency ratios for yourselves as well as everybody else, which obviously means lower profitability and the ROE number of course is still below 10%, ROTC obviously is over 11% this quarter. The ROA though, it's interesting you guys are around 93 basis points. Where do you think that goes to the ROA now with the new, obviously you have got the LCR ratio which hurts the profitability, what's a normal ROA once we get into a normal interest rate environment maybe over the next two or three years for you guys?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, if you think back, George, you started your question with kind of where we are long term normalize before the crisis and long-term normalize before the crisis for SunTrust, it was uncommon for us at all to show ROA that were in the 110. And as I look forward from here, that kind of a number would be the kind of number that we would be targeting for the company given the business mix and our ability to deliver services to our client base today.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Michael Rose", "Hi. Good morning. Maybe we could just start on CCAR and payout ratio. You guys have been around 30% dividend payout ratio. Is there any comfort at this point to move that higher? And then should we think about capital return approaching 100% move forward? Thanks.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning Michael. Thank you for the question. Yes. I think as we look at the guidance that the regulators have provided to the industry, one of the items of that they have noted for main street banks like us, is that the focus in CCAR this year will move to move a more quantitative approach and some of the constraints that had been placed on the industry have been moved toward those banks that require more tailored regulation and away from banks that have a more vanilla business model like us. So given the removal of some of those constraints, we would hope to be able to, on an overall basis, respond to the needs of our owners and change overall payouts and payout mix towards something that we think is more in the context of our long run payout ratios and mix and what they are asking for.", "Michael Rose", "Great. That's great color. And then just switching to credit. A lot of talk this quarter on strip centers. Can you just remind us of your exposure? And may be if you are still comfortable running into that asset class or if you have pulled back? Thanks.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. Maybe I will take that and just do it in sort of the overall category of retail and staying thematically on inter and intra diversity which has sort of been a core component of our focus for the last five years. So it started sort of a big number, got a little over $5 billion, 3.5% of total loans that sort of fit into that category. Commercial real estate would be about $900 million of that and the mall component of that would be very, very small. REITs would be about $700 million of that. Again, the mall component of that smaller and the preponderance of all that investment grade. And then the all other sort of in about $3.6 billion is really diversified both by geography and by product type. So it's everything, grocery, gas station, drug stores, home and furniture. But again very, very broad based.", "Michael Rose", "Great, Thanks for taking my questions.", "Bill Rogers", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning John.", "John Pancari", "On the expense side, the operating losses, I know that it was higher in the quarter. Could you just clarify again what drove that? And then separately on the efficiency ratio, I know you gave guidance for FY 2017 and you gave the longer-term guidance of below 60% by 2019. How do you think about 2018? If you could give us a little bit of color about how the efficiency ratio could look for the year for 2018? Thanks.", "Aleem Gillani", "All right. Well, I will talk about our operating losses first. Yes, it\u2019s a few million dollars higher this quarter. That actually relates to legal accrual that we took this quarter on a specific instance. So that's the context of the few million dollars. Efficiency ratio, John, what we try to do is we try to improve it every year. So in 2017, our intent is to get the somewhere between 61% and 62%. For 2019, our intent is to get below 60%. There are several people who just draw a straight line between those two. That's not our guidance but that's what several people do. And in the context of, we try to improve every year. We will try to improve in 2018 from 2017.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately on the loan growth front, can just give us a little bit more detail on the decline on the end-of-period basis that you saw in overall commercial? And is that just some of the reluctance in the wait and see attitude that\u2019s showing up there? And how soon could we see a nice pick up there on C&I? And then did you actually quantify your utilization rate and what the actual pipeline did for the quarter?", "Aleem Gillani", "Let me try to hit some of those. I think, yes, the answer is, it's a little bit of a latency, but it's also a little bit of the capital markets. So those are related. So there was opportunity for clients to take advantage of capital markets and it was a good environment, good rate environment, good appetite and the good news is we benefit on that side of the equation, from that standpoint. As it relates to the utilization, it's just slightly up. So I think slightly is a really important thing. Utilization over the last five years has been pretty flat. So any quarter can be slightly up or slightly down. I think it's tricky to get too much of a read into that. Pipelines, if we look at sort of the early stage pipelines, they are really good. There's a lot of conversations. There's proactive desire to want to do some things. People have got from drawing board. If we look at later stage pipelines, they fall under that latency category. They are slightly down. So if we put all that into balance, I think it's consistent with everything we said.", "Ankur Vyas", "Cynthia, we can go to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that will be from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Erika Najarian", "Hi. Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning Erika.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "I just wondered, one question, just wanted to zoom out on the landscape for a bit. There seems to be bipartisan support to amend the official SIFI buffer to $250 billion and I wonder if with SunTrust's $204 billion assets, if that does get passed through Congress, does that change how you are thinking about inorganic growth versus organic growth opportunities?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I like to think about this is an efficient frontier and you sort of find out where you are on the efficient frontier. Today, we think we are in a great place on the efficient frontier. We are big enough to absorb all the costs that we need to do from a regulatory standpoint and also make the investments we need to make in our business. What we have talked about as sort of tailored regulation in contrast, so while there is some dialog around official levels, there is also a lot of dialog around risk based establishment of capital levels that wouldn't be dependent upon necessarily an asset level. So the net of all that, we will be in the athletic position to move to wherever the ball goes. And if $250 billion is a hard line, then we will look at our strategy as we are several years away from that. So we have got time and capacity to build to do the things that we need to do and we will adjust and define our strategies based on where they land. But right now, I think we are really in the perfect place. We have got a risk-based model that's a lower risk-based model and that we are at an asset size that allows us to really compete highly effectively and under any sort of threshold, I think we will be sort of under the thresholds versus over the thresholds.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you.", "Ankur Vyas", "Cynthia, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that will come from the line of Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Stephen Scouten", "Hi guys. Thanks a lot. So I just wanted to follow up on some questions about credit. Any other areas that you are seeing any early signs of concern? I know we have seen some healthcare credits maybe show some weakness this quarter, especially on the syndicated side of things. Any changes that you guys are making to concentrations in certain areas?", "Bill Rogers", "Steve, we are actually very pleased with what we are seeing in the credit landscape right now. If we look across all of our businesses, our exposure to the clients that we would like to have, is just about perfect in the context of client mix, loan mix. And looking across, we are not seeing areas of weakness across anyone of the businesses in which we focus that would worry us to any material level at all. Now having said that, I might have just jinxed us. So I am knocking on the table right now. But right now, talking with our risk folks and our frontline folks, they are feeling really good about what they are hearing from clients and what they are seeing in the industry.", "Aleem Gillani", "But it also just undermines when times are good is when you plan the most and staying really committed to the diversity of our business model is critical. So if we do see one pocket whether it's one credit or one geography or one issue, we want to be in a position that, that doesn't impact our long-term objectives and opportunities.", "Stephen Scouten", "Okay. That's fantastic. And then just one follow-up on the loan growth. Do you guys still think you can grow kind of at the pace of one to two times GDP in the longer term? And maybe do we need a specific catalyst here in the near term to see something that more approximate that in the next couple quarters?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, our ability to grow, I think at north of GDP is well proven. We have got the infrastructure. We have got the product base. We have got the teammate talent. We have got the client mix to be able to continue to do that. And I would fully expect that we will continue to be able to do that. Now of course that's not in any given quarter, there's going to be quarterly volatility. But as I look out sort of year-over-year or through the cycle, yes, I fully expect that we are going to be able to grow north of GDP even north of GDP in our footprint and our footprint has shown good ability to grow north of national GDP.", "Stephen Scouten", "Fantastic. Thank so much guys. I appreciate it.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thank you.", "Ankur Vyas", "This concludes our call. Thanks to everyone for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn today's meeting over to Kris Dickson, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Kris Dickson", "Thanks, Carolene, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to SunTrust's second quarter earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements.

Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for, and does not edit nor guarantee, the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties.

I'm going to start this morning's call with a quick overview of the quarter, and I'm going to pass it on to Aleem to provide details on the results. I'm then going to come back and wrap up the call with some highlights from a business segment perspective, where you'll see we generated continued positive momentum in our Consumer and Wholesale businesses, but faced some headwinds in mortgage.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68 and net income grew to $365 million. Ongoing credit improvement, coupled with continued expense discipline, drove the earnings growth up 36% over last year.", "On a sequential quarter basis, both net interest and noninterest income were down modestly. The net interest income decline was from the expected decrease in our commercial loan swap income. The decline in noninterest income was driven by lower mortgage-related income. However, this was almost entirely offset by broad-based growth in other noninterest income categories, most notably, investment banking income and wealth management-related fees. Our intensive and ongoing efforts to drive efficiency improvements produced a 10% reduction in noninterest expense from last year. Core operating expenses continued to be well controlled this quarter, though the more volatile cyclical costs increased. This increase was something we expected coming off a low first quarter levels, though its magnitude was higher than I care to see. Overall, we saw a 2% sequential quarter increase in total expenses and an increase in our efficiency ratio. We still anticipate that these cyclical expenses will continue to trend down, and our focus on achieving our efficiency ratio objectives remains high.", "Average performing loans were up about $600 million during the quarter and the ongoing portfolio diversification efforts continued, with targeted growth in both C&I and commercial real estate loans. The credit quality story continues to be a good one, with nonperforming loans and net charge-offs hitting their lowest levels in over 5 years. Nonperforming loans declined by over 50% from last year and this quarter's net charge-off ratio improved to 59 basis points.", "Lastly, our capital position continue to improve, with our Tier 1 common ratio reaching new all-time high at an estimated 10.15%. Consistent with our CCAR announcement, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 per share during the quarter, and we also commenced our share repurchase program, buying back $50 million of our common stock during the quarter.", "Overall, for the quarter, we demonstrated progress in our strategic initiatives to grow and diversify our business, and our financial results continue to trend favorably. While we see solid pipelines and much improved loan production, our loan balance growth isn't quite yet what we'd like, and near-term mortgage revenue is likely to slow. However, the improving operating environment and southeastern economy, coupled with our enhanced focus and execution, I believe bode well for SunTrust future opportunities.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to walk you through the quarter in more detail.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments today with summary observations on this quarter's key earnings drivers and then, we'll delve deeper on subsequent slides.", "Our profitability growth continued this quarter with earnings per share of $0.68, which was $0.05 more than last quarter and $0.18 higher than last year. The sequential quarter increase was due to the ongoing improvement in credit quality, which resulted in a lower provision for loan losses and this more than offset the modest revenue decline and expense increase.", "Relative to last year, the 36% increase in earnings per share was due to a lower provision for credit losses and a 10% decline in noninterest expense. The latter of which was a result of our efficiency improvements and the abatement of cyclically high costs. Lower net interest income, due to the impact of the interest rate environment as well as declines in mortgage and trading revenue, were partial offsets. We'll review all of the underlying trend in more detail starting on Slide 5.", "Net interest income declined sequentially by $9 million. This was driven entirely by the $14 million reduction in commercial loan swap income, partially offset by an additional business day in the current quarter and modestly higher average earning assets. Consistent with our prior guidance, the net interest margin declined 8 basis points. The NIM compression resulted from the commercial loan swap income decline, as well as the ongoing compression in earning asset yields due to the low-rate environment. A modest reduction in deposit rates paid was a partial offset.", "Relative to the prior year, net interest income was $64 million lower and the net interest margin declined 14 basis points. The primary drivers of both were lower asset yields, a reduction in commercial loan swap income and the elimination of The Coca-Cola Company dividend. These factors were partially offset by favorable shifts in the deposit mix, lower deposit rates and the benefits from an over $3 billion reduction in our long-term debt.", "The steepening in the yield curve over the course of the quarter obviously is topical. So before we move on, let's spend a minute there. As you're all aware, a steeper curve is beneficial to spread income for the banking industry. Of course, higher short-term rates in conjunction with a steeper curve would be even better, but we have to start somewhere. Before touching on the positives of the steeper curve, let me first acknowledge a couple of the negatives, both of which we'll discuss more on subsequent slides. Higher rates are likely to lead to less mortgage refinance activity, as well as a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income. And we saw both of those occur this quarter. That said, I don't think many of us expected the refi boom to last too much longer. And while the mark-to-market value on our investment portfolio was lower today, the value of the entire balance sheet, most notably deposits, which obviously are not mark-to-market, is considerably more. If rates stay at their current levels, it will take a little time before the positive benefits of the steeper curve evidence themselves in the earnings string. For example, as existing investment securities and mortgages provide cash flow over the coming quarters, we'll reap the benefit by redeploying the proceeds at higher yields. We're also staying agile and trying to be opportunistic in managing through the rate environment. Specifically, during the second quarter, we issued 10-year debt early in the quarter when rates were low and locked in a very attractive coupon. Late in the quarter, after rates increased, we added some received fixed pay floating commercial loan swaps and we expect this to aid net interest income in the near term to the tune of about $8 million per quarter.", "All told, as we look toward the coming quarters and assuming current rates hold, we expect the steeper yield curve to help mitigate the declining trend in net interest margin, as well as to provide an increasing benefit to net interest income over time.", "With respect to our NIM outlook, specifically for the back half of this year, we anticipate a mid-single digit basis point decline in the third quarter, followed by a more stable margin in Q4.", "Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income declined modestly from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower mortgage-related revenue, which was largely offset by broad-based increases in other categories. I'll focus first on mortgage production income, which was $133 million for the quarter and down $26 million sequentially. The origination fee component of this income stream was about $60 million and stable to the prior quarter as closed loan volumes was similar to the strong levels in Q1.", "However, gain on sale revenue, which you'll recall we book at rate lock, declined due to the significant increase in mortgage rates. Mortgage servicing income was $1 million for the quarter, down $37 million sequentially and well below recent quarters. A lower net hedge gain was the driver, as rates were volatile during the quarter and the net hedge performance was essentially breakeven versus being a positive contributor to servicing income in recent quarters.", "While mortgage revenue was down, other fee income streams rebounded nicely from first quarter levels. Most notable was investment banking income, which was $93 million for the quarter and up $25 million sequentially, driven by increased syndicated finance and high-yield bond fees. Wealth Management-related revenue also increased with trust income and retail investment income up a combined $14 million due to improved market conditions and managed account growth.", "Looking year-over-year, noninterest income declined $82 million. Mortgage servicing income fell $69 million, driven by lower net hedge outperformance, as well as from declines in the value of the MSR due to the higher collection of cash flows, which is a result of the increase in refinance volume.", "I will note that we provided a summary schedule in the appendix, which gives you some additional clarity on the moving pieces within servicing income. In general, MSR net hedge income depends upon the rate environment, with periods of low interest rate volatility, such as we experienced over most of last year, more likely to produce favorable results than during a more volatile period, such as this quarter.", "As it relates to the decay, one partial benefit from a slowing refi market is that decay is expected to trend lower as refinance volume declines. Trading income also declined on a year-over-year basis as the increase in rates during the current quarter yielded lower fixed income trading results. On the flip side, investment banking income was higher by almost 25% and mortgage production increased as the decline in the repurchase provision more than offset lower gain on sale revenue.", "Touching briefly on mortgage repurchases, we continued to have an increased pace of resolution activity this quarter on the part of both SunTrust and the GSEs. You're probably aware that the FHFA has a published objective of completing rep and warranty demands on pre-conservatorship loan activity during 2013. Likewise, SunTrust is equally interested in working through the demands as quickly as possible. This increased pace of resolution evidenced itself in the second quarter by a lower pending population and higher charge-offs, as well as increased profile requests. Meanwhile, repurchase demands fell relative to first quarter levels.", "Let's move on to expenses on Slide 7. You'll recall that last quarter, we had an over $70 million or 50% sequential quarter decline in our credit-related expenses and operating losses, falling to levels that were below our normalized projections. As expected, these cyclical costs increased this quarter. Although as Bill noted, more than we would have liked, and drove the $34 million or 2% increase in total noninterest expenses. This increase was due entirely to a specific legal accrual recorded in the operating loss line item.", "Over the past several years, we and other banks have received various claims made by government agencies, primarily around our precrisis mortgage origination and servicing activities, a matter this quarter, is also mortgage related. And while it is not fully resolved, based on the information we have at hand, we believed it prudent to make an accrual this quarter for the estimated cost of resolution. Collections expense also rose, primarily due to an accelerated pace of default resolution. Partially offsetting these increases were lower core operating costs, including reductions in employee benefits expense due to seasonality.", "Looking at year-over-year trends, our efficiency improvement is evident in the $149 million or 10% noninterest expense decline. Roughly half of this was due to lower core operating costs, including compensation, legal and consulting. And the balance was due to the abatement of cyclical expenses. Year-to-date, our expenses were down over $300 million and prudent expense management remains an area of focus for Bill and our entire management team.", "As you can see on Slide 8, while our efficiency ratio improved year-over-year, it went the wrong direction sequentially due to the cyclical cost increase and the modest revenue decline. While this is my least favorite slide this quarter, we promised you and our SunTrust teammates transparency around this issue. We remain committed to achieving an approximate 65% efficiency ratio in 2013, and to our long-term target of below 60%.", "Turning to credit quality. The notable improvement in our asset quality trends continued this quarter. Net charge-offs, which were at their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007, declined by about 50% from last year and 20% sequentially, driven by the residential portfolio. The improving housing market certainly contributed as we're benefiting from fewer delinquencies, lower loss severities and higher prices upon disposition of foreclosed assets.", "Concurrent with lower net charge-offs, the provision expense has declined, while the allowance for loan and lease losses has also come down, albeit at a slower pace in recent quarters, as the allowance ratio has reached a lower absolute level. Similar to net charge-offs, nonperforming loans also declined about 50% from last year and 20% sequentially. Every loan category improved, most notably, residential loans. Contributing to the sequential quarter decline was the return of about $220 million in Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans to accruing status. You will recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, we reclassified about $230 million of residential loans previously discharged from Chapter 7 bankruptcy to nonperforming. While the preponderance of these loans had been current on their payments for some time, the reclassification to nonaccruing status was made to be consistent with regulatory guidance around this topic. Because these loans have now remained current for 6 months since the time they were moved to NPL, the $220 million was reclassified back into performing loans this quarter. This reclassification had no impact on our second quarter net charge-offs or loan loss provision. And these Chapter 7-related loans will remain classified as accruing TDRs.", "Lastly, on this topic, I'll point out that even excluding the impact of this reclassification, nonperforming loans declined by 7% sequentially. As we look to next quarter, we anticipate that nonperforming loans will continue to trend lower and for net charge-offs to be relatively stable to their second quarter level. Consistent with our comments in recent quarters, we continue to expect future credit quality improvement to be led by residential loans as commercial and consumer category credit metrics already approximate normalized levels.", "Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10. Average performing loans increased sequentially by $600 million or about 0.5 percentage point. C&I was the largest contributor and commercial real estate was also up. Bill will give you a little more color on both of these when he discusses our Wholesale segment results. Most other loan categories were relatively stable to the prior quarter, with the exception of continued takedowns in our government-guaranteed mortgage portfolio. Relative to the prior year, performing loans were down modestly. Guaranteed student loans and guaranteed mortgages declined a combined $4 billion, primarily due to the loan sales we executed late in 2012. Offsetting this, we had organic loan -- organic growth in C&I of $3.7 billion or 7%. Additionally, consumer loans, excluding guaranteed student loans, were up $1.1 billion or about 9%. Overall, loan growth remains moderate, though we continue to see some potential precursors to it improving, most notably in commercial loan pipelines that remained at healthy levels during the quarter, and gradual improvement in consumer and business confidence.", "Turning now to deposits. Average client deposits declined by about $1 billion this quarter, as growth in DDA was more than offset by seasonal reductions in commercial client tax accounts, as well as ongoing declines in time deposits. Relative to the prior year, deposits were up 1%, though the underlying favorable shift in the deposit mix was the more notable story. Lower cost deposits were up almost $4 billion, with DDA the largest contributor, growing by over $2 billion or 6%. Concurrently, higher cost time deposits were managed down by $3 billion or 17%. This favorable shift in deposit mix helped drive the approximately 20 basis points or $43 million year-over-year reduction in interest-bearing deposit cost.", "Slide 12 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital again expanded, this time, by approximately $300 million, and the Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 10.15%. Based upon our current interpretation of the final Basel III capital rules issued on July 2, we estimate our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio to be approximately 9.5%.", "As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio and our tangible book value per share both declined modestly, which was due to lower unrealized gains on our securities portfolio from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. This was largely offset by higher retained earnings. As Bill noted earlier, we commenced our share repurchase program this quarter, buying back $50 million of our common stock. Per the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the CCAR process, we have the capacity and the intent to repurchase up to another $150 million through the first quarter of 2014.", "With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.", "William Henry Rogers", "Okay. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll move to Slide 13. Taking a look at our business from a segment basis reveals several favorable operating trends. In our Consumer and Private Wealth Management businesses, net income was up 21% over last year, result of continued credit quality improvement and a 9% reduction in noninterest expenses due to changes in our staffing model and our branch network. We've steadily improved the efficiency ratio in this business, driving it down over 200 basis points from the last year to 65.4%. We obviously continue -- we need to continue to focus here, but we have good momentum behind us.", "The loan balances were down from last year due to the fourth quarter student loan sales. Consumers willingness to borrow seems to be improving. We continue to see strong production across our consumer lending products with production volume up 16%. Overall, deposits were down 1%, though DDA continued to increase and consumer time deposits were down 17%, marking another quarter of favorable mix trends.", "Now let's take a closer look at our Wholesale business this quarter. Our Wholesale business had its second highest net income quarter ever and grew 37% over last year. Ongoing improvement in credit quality drove a substantial decrease in the provision for credit losses, as well as a reduction in OREO expenses. A 10% expense decline from last year, as well as higher net interest income, helped drive down the efficiency ratio over 650 basis points to 52%. The segment had solid loan growth as we continued to grow C&I. Growth was driven by our not-for-profit and government industry vertical and dealer businesses, along with our large corporate lending areas, most notably, asset securitization, our energy vertical and asset-based lending.", "As you're aware, Wholesale is an important business for us. We've had a lot of success already in our strategic initiatives to grow its business, and much of that continued this quarter. Corporate investment banking turned another strong quarter with near-record net income. Our efforts to develop lead relationships have resulted in a 20% increase from January of last year and more than double what they were at the beginning of 2010. We're also gaining momentum on our efforts to grow targeted new businesses -- new business and commercial real estate. After reaching an inflection point in the first quarter, CRE was again profitable with further sequential growth and loan balances and marked production increases over last year. We continue to develop our pipeline and believe we'll be successful in our efforts to drive further growth here.", "Now let's take a look at mortgage. As you heard in some of Aleem's comments, our mortgage business was challenged this quarter. Continued credit quality improvement helped shrink the overall net loss from last year. However, lower servicing and gain on sale revenue has increased and -- as well as increased cyclical cost drove a larger sequential quarter net loss. This quarter's closed production volume was $9 billion, which was the highest level since the third quarter of 2009. That said, as you're aware, the state of affairs in the mortgage business changed a lot in the latter part of the quarter due to the increase in rates. And we do expect refi volume to begin abating during the second half of the year.", "Purchase volume, on the other hand, continues to gain momentum, though obviously, not nearly enough to offset the expected refi decline. While overall volume in our mortgage segment is expected to decline, let me provide a little perspective here. Noninterest income on our mortgage segment was about $130 million this quarter, which equated to 6% of SunTrust's total revenue. And while mortgage fee income declined by about $65 million sequentially, our business mix diversity helped mitigate this as our total revenue was relatively stable. Furthermore, ongoing credit quality improvement, which also happens to be primarily mortgage related, helped drive earnings growth this quarter.", "So in summary, considerable opportunity continues to remain across our markets. We have targeted strategies to address these opportunities and are seeing meaningful progress towards our goal. We remain focused on our priorities to grow profitably and improve our efficiency.", "With that said, Kris, let me turn it back over to you, and we can start taking some questions.", "Kris Dickson", "Thanks, Bill. Carolene, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from Paul Miller from FBR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Real quick housekeeping question. On your income statement, where it says mortgage banking, $133 million, is that net of the provision?", "William Henry Rogers", "The repurchase provision for the quarter, Paul?", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Yes.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, it is. Yes.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So that $133 million is net, so if that provision wasn't there, it would be even closer to $200 million?", "William Henry Rogers", "Now the provision for the quarter -- the repurchase provision for the quarter was $15 million.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Oh, $15 million. I'm sorry, yes. So it would be closer to $133 million plus $15 million?", "William Henry Rogers", "Exactly.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, can you add some more color on your purchase volumes? Like, are you guys increasing that dynamic by going after that product or is it just coming in the door? Because I know we've seen purchase volume up pretty strong across the space.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, we've always been a good purchase mortgage business. And you certainly saw that mix, substantially, in the latter part of the quarter. I mean, our closed purchase volume in June was 40% of our business. Of course, it was down overall, but it was 40% of our business. Our absent purchase are up fairly substantially. And if you look at us and think about some of the markets that we operate in and some of the recovery in those markets, we're pretty bullish on what we see on the purchase side. Now that being said, and I said in my comments, that's not enough to offset refi.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And then, one last question is, what percentage of your stuff is -- are HARP loans? Do you guys know that?", "William Henry Rogers", "In the quarter, about 20% of our refi was HARP. What you'll see is, applications of HARP are down, down fairly substantially, which wouldn't be a surprise.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment is from Erika Penala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Aleem, I just wanted to ask you a question about the comments you made on your MSR hedging. I guess, and I apologize if this seems like a silly question but I always thought that when long rates went up, then we could expect more hedge gains as you revalue your portfolio higher. But you mentioned on the call or during your prepared remarks that it would continue to go down, but decay less. Am I misunderstanding that?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. Erika, yes, a little bit. The decay is a reduction to income. If you take a look at the deck, in the back of the new slide that we put in to try and help you. If you take a look at Page 27 in the appendix, and you'll see a line there called decay. And that's a reduction to servicing income. And as refis decline, that decay ought to reduce. That's what -- that's the point I was trying to make. And so that ought to help servicing income over time.", "Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Got it. And my follow-up question is on your gain on sale margin. Could you help us think about, as we forecast out, how we should think about your purchase gain on sale, your non-HARP refi gain on sale and your HARP gain on sale?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, we -- the gain on sale, in general across those, is relatively similar in terms of margins. We don't have a higher -- we don't charge a higher rate for HARP, for example, versus other loans in general. Where we get a slightly higher gain on HARP is because we put most HARP loans in through our least expensive channel, consumer direct. And so the lower expense for HARP loans leads to a, sort of, slightly higher gain on those loans. I don't know if that gets to the point of your question. But in general, if you look at our margins across the board, they're not that much higher in terms of rates charged for HARP relative to other loans.", "Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So just to make sure I understand, and I'll get back in the queue, the mix shift shouldn't have an impact on your gain on sale margin going forward?", "Aleem Gillani", "It may have a little bit as, if HARP declines and therefore, we have less HARP to put through our least expensive channel, that might have a slight negative impact on our overall gain on sale.", "William Henry Rogers", "Well, Erika, let me also come back to a point I think you asked on your first question on MSR, on the hedging activity. We hedge our MSR out every day, not just every quarter, but every day. And so the volatility in MSR is a volatility that we're generally not willing to take on a day-to-day and quarter-to-quarter basis because we treat those at fair value. So if you think about MSR a little bit like a trading asset, that's volatility we're not willing to absorb. So we hedge that out. If you, again, take a look at Page 27, what you'll see is that the write-up in MSR this quarter was almost perfectly offset by the hedge. The hedge worked really well, and if that's getting to your point about you were expecting to see a big gain from MSR, that did, in fact, occur. The asset did go up, but the hedge worked very well to offset that.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Just questions on expenses. There's a bunch of moving parts, obviously, and I just wanted to understand a couple of things. First of all, can you give us an update on -- you had previously said something about environmental moving back towards $325 plus or minus $50 million. And obviously, we're back up this quarter, as expected, to about a 500 run rate. So can you just give us an understanding of, do you expect to trend back down towards $325 million plus or minus $50 million? Or from what you see, could we get distinctly better than that at some point?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think, this quarter, we did have a tick back up for a couple of reasons, Ken. Some of that was a little bit than we expected. And I think last quarter, we guided to a slight increase back up, just because of the big step down we had in Q1. And the Q1 number would have taken us to sort of well below that $325 million if you had annualized that. But if you look at, if you remove the 1 item, the mortgage-related legal accrual item, which goes into that -- and you can see some detail on this on Page 29 of our appendix. If you remove that 1 item, then, if you annualize the first half of the year, we're actually in line with that normalized level of $325 million plus or minus.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Well, exactly. And so if you're already there, I would presume that there's still a very good amount to go from here or is there any reason why that wouldn't continue to improve meaningfully?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I would hope it would decline some. But a portion of that, if you look, again, at Page 29, a portion of that is credit services. And that portion is actually what we pay every quarter anyway just the ongoing cost of putting new loans on the books. So that portion is not going to change very much. OREO, if you take a look at OREO costs, you've seen in the first half of the year, our OREO costs are a total of $1 million and that's not really going to be sustainable in the long term. You would expect that to come up a little bit. So while the other 2 components of our cyclical costs ought to come down some, there will be some upward pressure from OREO. In general, I would expect this to trend down a little bit, but I think that $325 million plus or minus is actually our attempt to give you some pretty good guidance.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. And remember, sort of pre-crisis, this number was sort of in the $200 million or $250 million kind of range, and it got up to about the $700 million range. So the $325 million was an attempt to try to figure out, the $325 million plus or minus as you defined it, was try to sort of figure out what's the new normal. I don't think the new normal will be pre-crisis. But clearly, we're trending down and I think the way Aleem described it, sort of, more annualized in the first half, seems to be that we're tracking towards what we talked about.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes. Okay. And then, my second question is just about the mortgage business. And you guys are doing a really good job on the comp and benefits side, adjusting. I'm just wondering, how much have you already adjusted with your mortgage capacity versus how much you could -- you still have to adjust here relative to the ongoing changes in the origination environment. So again, kind of, what's already been adjusted to versus how much can you adjust further?", "William Henry Rogers", "Let me take a crack at that. As you mentioned, there is about 20% of the variable cost which are in the categories you primarily talked about, which are compensation and then, just sort of when you think about sort of normal kind of cost of appraisals, and those things that are just highly variable to activity. Now they do lag a little bit because of the lock and close. We booked a gain at -- book the gain at lock and we pay the comp at close, so it's got a little bit of lag. But the 20% sort of happens. I mean, that's part of the system. We made a conscious decision as we were building up -- and seeing what we had in the refi side, as we built up this time, we took about 25% to 30% of our cost and essentially, let's call it, outsourced it for lack of a better word, and we created more variability. So that cost, in the past, would have been more fixed cost on our books. It's now more of a variable cost. So several weeks ago, literally the day, I think when we started to see what was going on with rates, we started putting contingency plans in place to not only get those variable costs down, some of the fixed costs we converted to variable and then, putting plans in place to figure out what the actual fixed cost as well, have to -- have to come down. And those plans are already in place. I mean, we've already punched the button. I guess, if I were trying to summarize sort of how to think about it, if you think about sort of the new mortgage takes all the legacy out, at the higher gain on sale, we were originating the mortgage at about a 50% efficiency ratio, to sort of think about that at a high level. Now with sort of the changes in trying to -- with the lag and everything else, our goal will be, and I'm fairly confident we can see a path to this, we'll continue to originate mortgages in a way that is accretive to our current efficiency ratio. Maybe, does that help?", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Yes. I guess, if you'd wrap it all together just on the expense comments, can expenses continue to come down from here, just in absolute terms?", "William Henry Rogers", "Total expenses or mortgage related?", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Total.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, total. So we were operating sort of at a total expense level, sort of, at $1.5 billion kind of handle to it. It now has a $1.3 billion handle to it, and that feels a lot better. So I have no intention of us going backwards from that standpoint. And we've committed to an efficiency ratio of 65%. And long term, we've committed to efficiency ratio of 60%. So some combination of revenue and expense, relativity is going to get us to that 60% efficiency ratio. So if we stay in this low-revenue environment, we're going to lower our expenses. Hopefully, with the initiatives that we've seen, changes in the rates, increase in NII, we'll be able to have some revenue component to add as well.", "Aleem Gillani", "Ken, when you think about what our expenses were last year or the year before, we were running at $6.2 billion in annualized expenses. If you look at where we've come in this year, we're running about $5.6 billion in annualized expenses. So we've taken $600 million of expenses out of the system so far, but we haven't stopped. There are going to be other opportunities. We're looking at other things. The focus of this management team remains intense.", "William Henry Rogers", "And also, that's sort of a natural. As expenses are coming down, they get annualized and actualized. So as they come down, they tend to have a natural momentum.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just, first, maybe a question on the margin. Given the fact that the swap roll-off is no longer a headwind for the next couple of quarters and Aleem, you mentioned reinvestment yields are improving, I understand that we're going to be down a couple of basis points next quarter and then, we should stabilize for 4Q. Can you just help us understand what the path may be beyond 4Q? Has the rate environment improved enough such that reinvesting yields are greater and you can -- and we can now see some more stability to the margin? And I have a follow-up.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, that's sort of a tough question, Ryan. There's a little bit of a crystal ball in here. I think the rate move that we saw was certainly nice, that the industry certainly needed it. So thank you, Mr. Bernanke. However, what the industry really needs is move up in short-term rates to take us back to the profitability levels that we enjoyed before the crisis. And while this is great and this will certainly help mitigate the overall decline in margin for the industry and for SunTrust, it's -- all this is, is a steep -- a somewhat steepening of the curve. We're certainly not back to normalized rate levels. And when you think about where the industry's net exposure is along the curve, it's generally much shorter as an industry than 10 years. So this is going to help somewhat. It's not going to be what we need to take us back to much higher net interest margin levels.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Aleem, if I could just add 1 follow-up. Just related to the swaps. I think the release mentioned that you did add some swaps in the quarter. Can you just remind us what the duration of the swap book is? And I think, also, according to the 10-Q, it says when rates rise, I think, 200 basis points, we should see NII rise 5.3%. Does that number take into account the impact of swaps rolling off? And if not, what would your asset sensitivity look like without that?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, our asset sensitivity -- let me start with our asset sensitivity, at the end of the second quarter, is currently 1.3%, and that's based on 100-basis-point parallel shift. So that's an instantaneous 100-basis-point parallel shift and how much our NII will go up as a result. The swap book duration at the end of the second quarter is 2.5 years. And the way the balance sheet is structured, we become more asset-sensitive every month, naturally, unless we do anything. So unless we take action, we're structured to become more asset-sensitive every month. As the swaps roll off over the course of the next 2.5 years, and some of them obviously are before that, you'll see us becoming more asset-sensitive over time.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment is from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I may have missed it, but can you give us some color on your Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III increased very nicely in the quarter? And we saw that the risk weighted asset number fell, which was a driving factor. What drove the risk-weighted assets down?", "Aleem Gillani", "Under the Basel III calculations, Gerard?", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "That's correct.", "Aleem Gillani", "The new rules have changed pretty substantially from the previous proposal. And the effect of the new rules is for some that there were -- in the previous proposal, there were multiple tiers of risk weightings for mortgages, including 1 tier that was up to 200%. The new rules basically put all mortgages into 2 tiers, 50% and 100%. And as a result, doing sort of normal mortgages for normal clients doesn't require us to put up additional capital for regular mortgages, as well as, for home equity. And that's a big benefit for our portfolio. We also received additional benefits for our CRE exposure. I think what you ought to see is, across of the industry, you ought to see regional banks do better as a result of the new rule than money center banks. You ought to see regional banks do better than investment banks. And you want to see banks that have mortgage exposures do better than banks that don't have mortgage exposures.", "William Henry Rogers", "Relatively.", "Aleem Gillani", "Relatively.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Right. Great. And the second question is, coming back to the environmental cost, where you guys have indicated that around that $325 million is the new norm, down from $700 million, but up from, I think, you said 2.25 or 2.50. What's preventing the environmental cost from -- when we get to a normalized state and you can pick whenever that is, it may be a couple of years from now, but what prevents the environmental cost from actually getting back to the way they were pre-crisis?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think one of the things that I'm concerned about in general is, as a country, as an industry, have we trained consumers that it's okay to not repay debt? And is there going to be a higher incidence of default over time in the future than there has been in the past? That is one of the things I'm concerned about, and that's one of the things that's holding me back from saying that we're going to get back to the world that we once had.", "William Henry Rogers", "And I think, if you also just -- some of this, well, may also be our natural conservatism. So there may be some factor in there, but if you think about the cost of things. So think about the cost of collection and credit services under a different regulatory environment. And the requirements to meet different and more stringent standards, there's just some additional cost for that. Now how much that is, I don't think we also know. That hasn't leveled out yet. But the only the reason we say it's more than previous is there just really is embedded increased different cost of compliance that didn't exist before.", "Aleem Gillani", "Cost of service is likely to be higher, as Bill says...", "William Henry Rogers", "It's going to be.", "Aleem Gillani", "And there are likely to be higher set of repurchase demands from the GSE in the future than there have been in the past, and a longer duration. And now it also takes longer to resolve default and other issues than it used to. So Gerard, I think, directionally, you're right. But I'm not sure that we'll get back to that type of a number.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment is from Brian Foran from Autonomous.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "I guess, given the payout ratio this year, I know it's early to talk about next year's CCAR, but just remind us, you will be accreting capital lapse and a big change in the balance sheet growth outlook. And maybe kind of looking at a 10%-ish Basel III ratio next year. How are you thinking about the priorities beyond organic growth, which I'm sure is the first priority both now and in the future?", "Aleem Gillani", "You're right. Organic growth is absolutely #1.", "William Henry Rogers", "You're also right, it's early to talk about CCAR.", "Aleem Gillani", "But if what you're asking, Brian, is a CCAR question...", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "I guess, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned CCAR, just more the capital waterfall now that 6 months ago, we wouldn't have necessarily had you in the excess capital bucket. Now we've got you in a pretty big excess capital bucket, at least, on our numbers. And just remind us of what your waterfall is beyond that organic growth between dividends, buybacks, acquisitions, all that kind of good stuff?", "Aleem Gillani", "Acquisitions aren't really making the list, that's pretty low down. Organic growth is #1, meeting our clients' needs is always #1 for SunTrust. Beyond that, to the extent that we'll be able to grow dividend and buyback and return capital to our shareholders, obviously, that's going to be high on our list. And by the way, we're delighted to be able to start to do that this quarter for the first time in 6 or 7 years. So we're pretty happy about being on this side of the line. Never say never for acquisitions, I guess, but we've got so much opportunity, Brian, to run our company better and become more efficient, to focus on our clients and just do more business. That's really what we're focused on.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "And then, just maybe 1 follow-up on the swaps, not to overkill the issue. But what's the reasoning -- so swaps versus MBS or swaps versus securities, I mean, the reasoning to add swaps, is it just more efficient from a balance sheet perspective? Or does that do other things for you as well?", "Aleem Gillani", "One of the things it does is that it's quick. When -- I said earlier that we're opportunistic in the way we did this, and we were able to add $2 billion in swaps right at the end of the quarter very quickly as rates moved up. So these swaps are efficient from a transactional perspective, both going in and going out. So that's helpful. They don't also affect earnings in a one-time way on the outlook. We sell securities and take a gain, that gain shows up immediately and then, requires an adjustment by everybody. Whereas, if we exited swaps, the gain in the swap just accretes in the income over the original life of the swap, and so it doesn't require a lot of sort of extra adjustments. I guess, one other point is that they are a really good hedge in the balance sheet for our commercial loans.", "Operator", "Our next question or comment is from Marty Mosby from Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Aleem, I wanted to walk through the mortgage banking segment income statement. You're showing a $76 million loss in the quarter. And what I was trying to do is think of, as you talked about the production coming down, you've already kind of, like you said, you do have locks so you've already got a lot of the gain on sale margin compression in there. But I think there's 3 other moving pieces that will, potentially, more than bring this to a breakeven. I think you've got the $72 million legal matter in this segment because that would be real estate-related. You've got the $28 million of incremental collection cost, and you also have suppressed servicing profitability as your, like you said, decay goes back to where it was. Even if you have your hedge about 0 or breakeven, your decay should improve by about $20 million. So in my mind, I'm just trying to map the $76 million to, at least, to break even in the short run, and these 3 moving pieces seem to kind of get me there. I just wanted to see what you thought about that.", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, I think you got the direction right, but the numbers, perhaps, not exactly right. That legal matter wasn't as high as the $76 million. We referenced the legal matter as being sort of the primary driver for our overall increase in expenses, which were up $34 million. So the legal matter I would think about it in that context rather than the $76 million. The increase in operational expenses, credit expenses, was about 18. And I think you've mentioned a higher number just now. And over time, yes, I think directionally, you're also right on servicing. And servicing income ought to also come back, will also come back over time as we start to get less volatility again, and rates will help and as decays come down. So directionally, I think you're right on every one of those pieces. But the numbers you mentioned seem a little high to me.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just a follow up on the servicing side. When you look at your net hedge performance, it's been favorable. And you mentioned the volatility being the driver of the negative that you saw going from -- what's been a $30 million to $40 million net positive, down to about breakeven. Are you using forward commitments, and is that mainly why you end up with a little more the volatility matter than if you were using interest rate swaps, which don't typically be -- aren't as related to the volatility in the marketplace. So I just was wondering, if we do see rates leveling back out, could even the net hedge performance improve from where it's at right now?", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, I would think about it this way. MSR, as an asset, are inherently negatively convexed. So within MSR, we're naturally short volatility. So the hedging process requires that we buy volatility or offset that short volatility position. And it's cheaper to do that in any quarter when there is less volatility in the market. So and that's been the case as we have seen for the last year or so. This quarter, obviously, there was a lot of rate volatility in the market. And so just the cost of buying back that short volatility position went up. If, as you say, we head back to a more normal rate environment -- and it sort of doesn't really matter if it's going up or down as long as it's not volatile, the hedge ought to start to perform -- the outperformance we've had in the hedge ought to start to come back, yes.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And just out of curiosity, the product you're using to get that convexity is a forward commitment? Is that -- what's the product you're using to hedge here?", "Aleem Gillani", "We've got some forwards, we've got futures, we've got swaps, we've got securities and we have options.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Would swaps be a smaller part of that? I'm just trying to -- because typically, the swaps don't have the convexity and don't relate to the volatility, is what I'm trying to get at.", "Aleem Gillani", "You're exactly right. When we use swaps, we're using that for a duration hedge, not really a convexity hedge. And it's more options and forwards that will help us on the convexity side.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Aleem, I just wanted to ask a question from Page 25 of the supplement, and the Corporate and Other page, where you say, where you lay out your interest income, interest rate sensitivity. It looks like it's down by a bit more than half from the first quarter numbers that you put on the same page. And I guess, I'm just curious if you can give a little color as to what's going on there? And how you're thinking about how that might change over the course of the next 3 to 6 months?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Matt, I think that's another crystal ball question. That depends on exactly what rates do, how steep the curve gets and whether short rates move at all. But in general, our asset sensitivity increases by -- and I'm going to round here, but it's about 0.1/10 of 1% per month. So it will naturally go up unless we do something. What we did do in this quarter is we added some of those swaps. So the swaps that we added reduced our asset sensitivity some, but they also added $8 million a quarter to our interest income. And on Page 24 of the deck, when you look at the new swap income forecast, you'll see that that's flattened out pretty considerably now right into the middle of next year. So we added some surety as we took advantage of the higher rates that we saw in the second quarter, and that did make us a little bit less asset-sensitive in the short term. But that asset sensitivity will come back while we've added NII.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Let me ask a question about the non-mortgage lending business, if I can. Bill, you mentioned your increased level of confidence about commercial lending and potential loan growth in the second half of the year. Could you give us a little more color as to why you're feeling more confident about that? And are there any specific regions or products within C&I that are particularly fertile areas for loan growth?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, and I don't want to get over my skis on confidence, but I want to talk about the things that we do see. And if you sort of look at -- one of the bigger things that we look at, as I look at it, are our commercial pipeline. Our commercial pipeline was about equal to what it was at the end of the first quarter. But that's about 60% ahead of where it was at the end of 2012. So we're built -- so we're building a pipeline that's positive. In terms of the places where we've seen, to date, good activity, in the commercial side, our not-for-profit business has been really good. On the CIB side our energy business, I'm really happy to see things like -- that we've invested in, like asset-based lending, are starting to click in and provide some more activity. And then, related to the consumer side, production is up and we saw -- I don't -- maybe it's an inflection point, but we saw an inflection point on home equity that, that sort of finally stabilized. Remember, we have sort of been in a fully attriting mode on home equity over the last quarter, that sort of has stabilized. And production in home equity is really, really good. So it's mainly production and pipeline kind of things that I see, and those are all offset against continued deleveraging and other activities. And then, the final is CRE. And albeit off a smaller base, it's about $5 billion base. I mean, similar there, we hit an inflection point already. So at the last quarter, we hit an inflection point. We're now starting to be in a growth mode. And production there in the -- I guess, primarily, the institutional side has been good. From a region-by-region perspective, it's pretty evenly distributed, but we are seeing parts of our markets, take Florida, probably, as the largest example of the most recovery in the shortest period of time, which make us more optimistic as we see sort of state unemployment rates, again, particularly in areas that were way down, like Florida, which are now way up, and trending ahead of national numbers.", "Mark Palmer - BTIG, LLC, Research Division", "One of your competitors mentioned continued conservatism in the mid-market and small business sector. Is that consistent with what you're seeing as well?", "William Henry Rogers", "You mean, from the client perspective, continued conservatism?", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "William Henry Rogers", "I think that's accurate. They continue to have a lot of cash, while there's lots of dialogue and conversation. But I think conservatism in that group, as defined, is an accurate statement.", "Kris Dickson", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we appreciate it. If you have any further questions, certainly, feel free to give the IR department a call. Otherwise, have a great weekend.", "Operator", "That concludes today's conference call.

(NYSE:STI) Q1 2009 Earnings Call April 23, 2009  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Steve Shriner \u2013 Director, Investor Relations", "James Wells \u2013 Chief Executive Officer", "Mark Chancy \u2013 Chief Financial Officer", "Tom Freeman \u2013 Chief Risk Officer", "Analysts", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "[Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford Berstein]", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets", "Jefferson Harralson \u2013 KBW", "Operator", "Welcome to the SunTrust first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I'd now like to introduce Mr. Steve Shriner.", "Steve Shriner", "Good morning. Welcome to SunTrust's first quarter earnings conference. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. Slide 2 outlines the content which includes capital updates, an overview of our financial results and an in depth credit review.", "The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the investor relations section of the web site.", "With me today among other members of our executive management team are Jim Wells, our CEO, Mark Chancy, our CFO and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter. Mark will then discuss our financial performance and Tom will conclude with an in-depth review of asset quality. At the conclusion of the formal remarks, we'll open the session for questions. ", "Before we get started, I need to remind you our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings which are available on our website.", "Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstance or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. We disclaim any responsibility to do so. During the call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website at www.suntrust.com. With that, let me turn it over to Jim.", "James Wells", "Good morning everybody. There are two clear messages that emerge from our first quarter results. First, we are still working through credit and earnings challenges as the weak economy continues to take a toll on performance. Second, there are some preliminary signs of improvement in several key areas including mortgage originations, consumer and commercial deposits and early stage delinquencies.", "This morning's results confirm that SunTrust remains financially strong with enhanced capital, high liquidity and bolstered reserves. In other words, we do have the resources necessary to continue to manage successfully through this cycle to withstand the impact of continued economic weakness and to emerge on the other side of this situation well positioned.", "In addition, we're doing a pretty good job of controlling what we can control and taking advantage of opportunities as was evident in the expected expense discipline and impressive deposit growth and strong mortgage revenue growth, all of which contributed to what I would describe as solid core results and have positive implications for future performance.", "Clearly this positive underlying picture is overshadowed by the impact of recession related pressure. That gets me back to our quarterly loss, what caused it and what it means. As you know we reported a total loss of $2.49 per share. However, the overwhelming majority of it was attributable to a non cash tax charge of $714.8 million or $2.03 per share related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our real estate lending businesses.", "It's important to note that the goodwill impairment charge was a direct result of continued real estate market and macro economic deterioration that put downward pressure on the fair value of our mortgage and commercial real estate related assets.", "It reflects the current cyclical downturn which resulted in depressed earnings in these businesses and a significant decline in SunTrust market capitalization during the first quarter. I'll point out that this charge does not reflect our view of the intrinsic value of the related businesses or our commitment to them. It is also important to reiterate that goodwill impairment charge does not impact our strong regulatory capital intangible equity ratios.", "Excluding this goodwill impairment, our core loss for the quarter was $0.46 significantly less than the loss in the prior quarter. We clearly do not like reporting a loss of any level, but you all know that the operating environment remains difficult.", "We hear glimmers of hope with respect to economic and credit outlook, and while we know recovery will be forthcoming, we're not looking for things to turn around quickly. It is therefore, appropriate that we remain sharply focused on maintaining a strong capital position and mitigating near term recession related risk.", "I mentioned capital liquidity a moment ago. Our strong regulatory capital position was further enhanced during the quarter. Despite the loss we incurred this quarter the estimated Tier One capital ratio increased 13 basis points over the last quarter to 11%. Moreover, our equity to assets ratio increased materially in the quarter.", "I'll also point out here that we have substantial liquidity available due to inflows of high quality deposits and longer term financing sources although demand remains weak for loans to higher quality borrowers.", "Given our strong capital position, you may wonder what our position is on the repayment of the government preferred capital. Clearly we would like to return it as soon as is practical, recognizing that it will require regulatory approval and that approval will likely be dependent on the point of view that the recession is easing.", "I'd like to spend a little more time on the operating environment we faced during the first quarter before I turn it over to Mark to provide details on financial results.", "There were a lot of different factors in play this quarter and not all were negative. First, we are seeing some weakness in our commercial client base related to stress on their revenues and overall profitability particularly those in cyclical industries. This was most evident in our commercial charge off number, however access to capital markets has improved for our larger clients and as a result, we did experience modest improvement in the overall capital markets revenues. Commercial clients have also increased their liquidity and as a result, deposits grew significantly and we saw line of credit utilization decrease in the first quarter. ", "On the consumer side we experienced increased losses on real estate secured loans as values declined and unemployment increased. In other portfolios, losses declined and early stage delinquencies moderated and even in some cases declined.", "Now I'll take a moment to discuss a very positive trend, our overall deposit growth as growth from consumer clients was robust and the overall mix was quite attractive. Consumer and commercial deposits were up $7.2 million or 6.8% when compared to the fourth quarter of ", "08. ", "We believe a couple of factors were in play here, including client preference for insured deposit products, receptivity of our Live Solid, Bank Solid comprehensive marketing efforts, improved products and pricing, and our elevated focus on client service. This has been a multi-faceted approach to improving the overall client experience resulting in enhanced new relationships as well as improved retention and expansion of existing households.", "One last point of particular note on the consumer side before I move on was mortgage refinancing. Volumes were up dramatically, nearly 90% compared to the fourth quarter. This increase not only provided a significant source of fee income but from a macro perspective, it also puts more money in consumer's hands.", "As you know, a major focus of our organization has been expense control. Our commitment to tightening and managing expenses remains unchanged. However, there are numerous factors impacting our expense line this quarter.", "We've talked about credit related expenses previously and we now have increased FDIC insurance premiums and pension costs adding to our expense pressure. We have largely accomplished our highly successful program run rate savings goal of $600 million in 2009. Last quarter we also disclosed additional measures including no merit based salary increased for over 4,000 senior managers and reduced target levels for salary increases across the board for the rest of the team.", "Today, SunTrust is a leaner, more efficient and more productive organization than was the case a short time ago. You should know that our expense vigilance continues every day. We are focused on things we can control such as travel, consulting and vendor management, and further we are continuously reviewing our support structures and business units seeking to provide superior client service as efficiently as possible.", "At the same time our focus extends beyond expense and risk management. We're also actively focused on ensuring that we are prepared to take advantage of revenue opportunities. Last summer we commissioned an internal team to perform an in depth evaluation of improvement opportunities.", "They confirmed that front line execution to client experience and employee satisfactions were the keys to making us more successful and improving client acquisition and retention. The result of this analysis has been the successful implementation of many incremental initiatives that are collectively having a direct impact on client as well as employee satisfaction.", "The results are showing up in both households and accounts and a client satisfaction research results. We are committed to excellence in execution. That's what our current and prospective clients demand, a bank that they can trust to get things done right every time.", "As I've said numerous times, we simply to not know how long or how deep this recession will be but we do know that there will be a conclusion to it. We are keeping our eye on the ball and are executing on many initiatives to help ensure that SunTrust emerges stronger and better positioned competitively to deliver superior shareholder returns.", "Our performance on the other side of this tough cycle will in large part be driven by initiatives we are pursuing today to expand our revenue generation capacity, increase expense efficiency and to improve the profitability of the balance sheet as well as prudently managing credit.", "Our priority has been and remains to continue to navigate successfully through this extraordinarily tough cycle while simultaneously positioning ourselves to take advantage of the future growth opportunities that will lie on the other side. Given our strength and resilience and the underlying progress reflected in the first quarter, we remain confident in ability to do both of those things.", "And now I'll hand it to Mark.", "Mark Chancy", "Good morning everyone. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 4, the earnings presentation with a brief discussion of our capital position. I'm pleased to report that all of our key capital ratios increased during the quarter. The Tier One capital ratio is estimated to be 11%, up 13 basis points from the fourth quarter level, and the total capital ratio increased 11 basis points.", "Importantly, all of our equity to asset ratios also increased, and specifically our total equity to total asset ratio increased nearly 130 basis points to 12.5% and our tangible common equity ratio increased 23 basis points to 5.82%.", "The primary driver was a $9.3 billion or 5% reduction in tangible assets with a $6 billion reduction in other assets due to the January settlement of the sales of mortgage backed securities at year end that we mentioned during last quarter's call. The remaining $3 billion was primarily related to a reduction in trading securities during the quarter.", "We view our regulatory and tangible equity ratios as very strong both on an absolute basis relative to our risk profile and comparatively to other financial institutions.", "In addition to the protection that our capital provides, SunTrust remained high liquid at quarter end. Core deposits increased to a record over $112 billion. We had nearly $6 billion in cash and no overnight borrowings as of March 31.", "As such, we believe this combination of strong capital and high liquidity positions us to meet the borrowing needs of our clients while maintaining an adequate buffer against further deterioration in the economy.", "Shifting to Slide 5 and the summary of the financial results, for the quarter we posted a loss of common shareholders of $875 million or $2.49 per share. Excluding the goodwill charge, the loss was $161 million or $0.46 per share. As Jim mentioned, these results are clearly not good results but the core earnings of the organization did improve versus the fourth quarter.", "Improvement occurred largely on the strength of mortgage related revenues and in spite of an increase in seasonal employee benefits costs, higher FDIC premiums and significantly increased pension costs.", "As you will see in a few minutes, we had a net benefit this quarter of non interest income of approximately $120 million which was largely related to a write up in the value of our long term debt and related hedges carried at fair value. However, the fundamental earnings of the organization did improve even if you adjust for these items.", "As you can see on the slide, net interest income declined compared to both the first quarter of last year and the fourth quarter of 2008. While average earning asset levels were comparable in these periods, the rate earned on assets declined more rapidly than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities and as a result the margin depressed.", "Provision was up slightly versus the fourth quarter as we continued to build the allowance for loan and lease losses to 2.21% in the quarter.", "Non interest income was a bright spot in the quarter, improving 60% versus the fourth quarter and 8% year over year largely driven on mortgage related revenues. During the quarter we reported a tax benefit of $151 million against a pre tax loss of $966 million for an effective tax rate of negative 15.6%. This tax benefit appears low to you I'm sure and that is because 90% of the $751 million of goodwill impairment was non tax deductible.", "The last comment I'd like to make on this slide is to note that $66 million of the $71 million in deferred dividends is the quarterly cost to the company of the outstanding $4.9 billion in preferred securities that were sold to the treasury in 2008.", "Now let's move to Slide 6 and we'll talk about the balance sheet. Overall loan balances depicted on this slide declined 3% and 1% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively, Total loans as reported in the financial tables accompanying the press release will show a 1.7% increase year over year and the difference between these two is that non performing loans have been excluded from this slide.", "Our aggressive efforts to reduce exposure to construction lending are evident from the 17% balance decline that's noted in the quarter. The home equity, commercial real estate and consumer direct portfolios increased both year over year and since the fourth quarter.", "Commercial lending is a portfolio that we have been growing as you can see by the 8% increase versus last year. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven largely by our mid size and larger corporate clients paying down their lines of credit as their utilization rate declined about 2%.", "The reduced utilization is driven by both improved access to the capital markets funding and by lower working capital needs as inventories are being reduced and investments are being delayed or cancelled due to the economic environment.", "We are very pleased with the accelerated pace of deposit growth in the quarter and the improved mix. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 5% in the quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2008. Most products showed strong growth and demand deposits led the growth at 9% sequential quarter or 36% on a sequential annualized basis.", "I'm going to elaborate on core deposit growth on the next slide, so the final point here is that growth in core deposits allowed us to aggressively reduce our brokered and foreign deposits in the quarter by over $5 billion or 41%.", "So let's move to Slide 7 for a more detailed view of deposit trends. We noted during our last earnings call that deposit growth had accelerated during the fourth quarter and you can clearly see on this slide that the trend continued during the first quarter as well. Average monthly core deposit balances increased 6.7% from December to March with an average balance of $111 billion in March and an ending balance of a record $112 billion.", "The other trend that is clearly evident in this slide is that the increase in growth in demand deposits which was almost 17% from December to March as compared to the 9% quarterly average growth on the previous slide and we will readily acknowledge that a portion of the core deposit growth is related to an industry wide life safety as well as seasonality.", "But we also firmly believe that we are seeing the benefits of a number of actions that we have taken. For example, the accounts and households acquired during our successful My Cause campaign are maturing. The Live Solid Bank Solid brand awareness advertising has been very well received and we've been refining our pricing packages.", "However, our actions go beyond advertising and pricing. As Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, we've been intensely focused on improving execution and operational excellence. We are streamlining account opening processes, reducing error rates, increasing training and many other little things that are making us easier to do business with.", "Early results of these efforts include improved client service and satisfaction and a resulting increase in client acquisition and retention rates. While deposit growth may moderate, or even turn negative as the seasons change and the economy improves, increased core deposits and improved mix and a continued focus on execution, creates a solid foundation to drive margin and earnings in future periods.", "So let me shift to margin on Slide 8. After remaining relatively stable for the past year at slightly above 3%, net interest margin declined to 2.87% in the first quarter, down 20 basis points year over year and 27 basis points sequentially. This compression was a result of several factors, some longer term and some of which are temporary and should revert more quickly. ", "On average, one month LIBOR declined 175 basis points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter and being asset sensitive, our market index floating rate asset yield re-priced downward faster than the corresponding liability. This re-pricing accounted for approximately two thirds of the margin depression which we expect to recover as our liabilities re-price over the remainder of the year.", "Additionally, the strong growth in our core deposits and our high level of liquidity that I previously discussed, significantly outpaced our loan growth in the quarter, creating a short term drag on margin as we look to leverage these deposits on the balance sheet in future periods.", "Finally, the remaining compression in margin was due to the increase in non performing loans as well as the sale of higher yielding mortgage backed securities and their replacement with lower yielding MBS's as part of our MSR hedging strategy during the fourth quarter.", "In short, we believe that the margin is temporarily depressed and we are optimistic about the possibility of expanding over the remainder of 2009. Specifically, we have a significant dollar amount of customer and wholesale CD's that will re-price in the second and third quarters and we have additional opportunities to refinance selective borrowings in the near future.", "Moving to Slide 9 and provision expense, Tom will cover credit in detail in a moment, so I'll be brief here. Total provision expense for the quarter was $994 million, up $32 million from the fourth quarter.", "Net charge offs increased $610 million up 10% in the fourth quarter to 1.97% of loans. Provision of $384 million was recorded in excess of net charge offs in the quarter to build the loan loss reserve. This reserve build was down $26 million compared to last quarter, but it did serve to increase the allowance 2.21% of loans.", "Part of the increased allowance relates to a change in how we will classify certain borrower misrepresentation related losses during 2009 and I'll provide some details on this change in a few minutes. ", "Let's move to non interest income on Slide 10. Reported non interest growth was up 60% and 8% as compared to the fourth quarter and last year respectively. After adjusting for a number of non core items impacting the quarters, non interest income increased a strong 27% and 4% respectively. We provided the detail underlying our non interest income adjustments as well as some additional data in the appendix for your review.", "The largest adjustments in the first quarter results was a $113 million write up in the value of our publicly traded debt and related hedges carried at fair value. Smaller adjustments included a partial reversal of the mortgage servicing impairment recorded in the first quarter and a gain of $25 million on the extinguishment of over $100 million of debt we purchased at a discount.", "These last two items were largely offset by some additional write downs on trading securities and marks on mortgage loans carried at fair value.", "Mortgage related revenue and in particular mortgage production income was the primary driver behind the strong growth in non interest income. Volume increased 86% from the fourth quarter and 15% relative to last year. In addition to higher volumes, production margins increased and mortgage repurchase reserves decreased versus the fourth quarter.", "Additional deposits in the quarter included enhanced trading revenues from our fixed income and derivatives units and investment banking revenues driven by our bond origination and direct financing units.", "However, trust income and retail investments income did decline in line with market values and lower transaction volumes, while service charges declined as a result of higher average balances and lower insufficient fund fees.", "Overall, we are relatively pleased with non interest income in the quarter given the improvement in mortgage revenue and the solid quarter posted in our capital markets businesses However, we recognize that both of these revenue sources are highly sensitive to interest rates, market liquidity and the economy in general.", "Mortgage production volumes in particular have shown a high degree of sensitivity around the 5% coupon level. Additionally, production margins were favorably impacted by high demand and an industry wide lack of capacity to fully meet the demand and therefore higher interest rates and increasing industry capacity could negatively impact production revenues in future quarters.", "Let's turn to Slide 11 and talk about non interest expenses. On a reported basis, non interest expense increased 74% when compared to the first quarter of 2008 and 37% compared to the fourth quarter. The only adjustment we've made to the current quarter as you can see on the slide, is $751 million in goodwill impairment discussed previously.", "Excluding goodwill, and the minor amounts in prior periods, non interest expense declined 9% in the fourth quarter and increased 12% year over year. However, there are a number of items impacting these adjusted numbers that warrants additional explanation.", "The bottom line is that we've provided the underlying drivers for the majority of the changes as compared to the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively so let me walk you through the slide. The total year over year increase in adjusted expenses is $150 million. As you can see, the sum of the four lines below the $150 million on the slide is $183 million.", "What this means is that more than all of the increase over 120% in fact, was driven by credit costs, higher FDIC premiums and pension costs. Said another way, this means that the net of all remaining expenses at SunTrust declined by $33 million year over year.", "On a sequential quarter decline in expenses, the same items listed explain about 90% of the decline, meaning that all other expenses together declined about $12 million. All of the items listed on the page should be fairly self explanatory with the exception of the large decline in credit costs compared to the fourth quarter. So please turn to Slide 12 where I'll describe some changes we've made to our approach for certain fraud and claim denial related losses.", "This slide shows where we record certain types of losses among provision, operating loss and other real estate related accounts. The only items that are changing in the quarter are highlighted on the slide. ", "Borrower misrepresentation and claim denials were previously charged to operating losses and you may remember that we had established an increased operating loss reserve related to these loans in the third and fourth quarters of 2008.", "Beginning in 2009 we will record these losses as charge offs and the necessary reserves related to these loans will be included within the overall allowance for loan losses. While we expect losses to continue on loans with borrower misrepresentations, we have concluded that general economic and credit conditions are the predominant contributor to the losses and as such, we will treat them as credit losses going forward.", "If you will turn to Slide 13, I'll go over the sequential quarter impacts this change creates. This slide depicts the fourth quarter and first quarter classifications for fraud and claim denial losses and reserves.", "The top box included operating loss expenses in reserves where the operating losses include both borrower misrepresentation related to losses and the primarily deposit related losses noted on the previous slide. Going forward, operating losses will not include the borrower misrepresentation related losses.", "Excluding these losses, operating losses overall have historically been $10 million to $20 million per quarter. These historical losses were primarily driven by deposit related fraud and occasionally litigation related expenses. Deposit related fraud and litigation typically increase during recessions and therefore we expect the operating loss in future quarters will probably revert to the middle to upper end of the historical range. ", "However, there will be likely some volatility in these results. At the bottom of the top box you can see that operating losses in the quarter were approximately $23 million or slightly above the range that I just discussed.", "Operating loss write downs in the first quarter were $187 million up $118 million from the $69 million recorded in the fourth quarter. The majority of the increase was due to a backlog of disputed claim denials that the company elected to write off as the probability of recovery had diminished. ", "In the bottom box, we have summarized the combined operating loss and provision related income statement impacts ending reserves. So while the geography of these expenses and reserves has changed, the absolute level of both did not change significantly during the first quarter. Specifically, total expenses related to these items declined by $23 million and as compared to the fourth quarter while reserves increased about $8 million. ", "So just to summarize, going forward, these types of fraud related losses will be recognized to charge offs and reserve for any allowance. Since we have been working through this backlog of disputed claims noted above, we expect that in the second quarter, charge offs will increase by roughly $100 million to reflect this change.", "Now, if you'll turn to Slide 14 for a brief comment on our securities portfolio before I turn it over to Tom to talk about credit. We have provided you in the past, detailed disclosures regarding our higher risk security holdings in previous quarters and in our last quarterly call we noted that we had succeeded in largely de-risking the portfolio of higher risk trading assets.", "This slide depicts our overall securities holdings at the end of the first quarter. The total of trading and available for sales portfolios totaled $27 billion at the end of the quarter with 80% of fixed income securities invested in highly liquid,  high quality government and agency securities.", "So with that as background, let me turn it over to Tom for a detailed review of our asset quality.", "Tom Freeman", "This morning, I'm going to provide a review of our asset quality beginning on Slide 15 of the presentation. Credit quality weakened in the first quarter although there were some positive signs in certain portfolio segments.", "The trends are clearly evident on the schedules. Non performing assets and charge offs showed increased during the quarter while on the other hand, delinquencies improved from several consumer and mortgage asset classes.", "Non performing assets increased $790 million during the first quarter to $5.2 billion or 4.21% of loans and other repossessed assets. This change is about the same dollar increase as in the third and fourth quarters. The growth was largely comprised of residential mortgages and residential construction.", "Mark has already spoken about the classification change for borrower misrepresentation and claim denial related loan losses that contributed to our first quarter reserve build so we'll add to his comments on that point.", "In total, we added $384 million to the allowance in the first quarter which raised our reserves to loan coverage ratio to 2.21%. Growth in the allowance excluding the classification change was $211 million compared to $410 million in the fourth quarter.", "Please turn to Slide 16. Asset quality issues remain primarily residential real estate related. This includes residential mortgages, home equity products, residential construction and construction deferred. ", "Given the current economic environment, our general C&I portfolio continues to perform reasonably well. While the effects of the recession can be seen in weaker business activity, for the most part stress have been limited to the cyclical industries that typically experience declines in revenues and cash flow through general business downturns.", "In particular, we are watching industries linked to residential and commercial construction and supply, auto dealers and other related auto, trucking and transportation and advertising based media companies. Our portfolio is well diversified by industry and geography which helps balance the negative impacts of weaker industries.", "Commercial real estate portfolio also continues to perform reasonably well. It is diversified by product type and geography and is largely owner occupied. While we did see a minor increase in early stage delinquency, we have not experienced any material deterioration in this portfolio.", "Overall, annualized first quarter net charge offs increased 197 basis points up from 172 basis points in the fourth quarter. The increase was primarily centered in residential real estate categories while consumer direct and indirect loss rates improved.", "The commercial category also increased in the quarter. This increase was largely as a result of a few larger write downs to clients in cyclical industries discussed earlier. Commercial real estate charge offs returned to a level more consistent with recent experience. After a fourth quarter commercial real estate charge off were primarily affected by a single large commercial purpose credit that was secured by real estate.", "One of the leading indicators of credit quality is 30 to 89 day past dues. This is a positive data point for us in the first quarter, declining 5 basis points to 176 basis points. We experienced improvements in early stage delinquencies in nearly all consumer and mortgage products, two small portfolios, direct consumer loans, the majority of which are government guaranteed, and credit cards with a principal exceptions. Delinquencies in most of the commercial categories were relatively stable quarter over quarter.", "Seasonality may explain some of this delinquency improvement in the consumer and mortgage book so I'm not suggesting that we've turned the corner, but believe our focus on consumer and mortgage collections in default mitigation also contributed to the decline.", "Some of the economic data has moderated such as consumer confidence and that may also be having an impact. We should also recognize that the majority of our customers are meeting their mortgage obligations on a month to month basis. In fact, over 90% of our combined residential mortgages are current.", "The final point on this slide is that our credit card portfolio is very small compared to most banks our size. We have just $976 million in credit card receivables and consumer card is only $475 million of the total. The remainder is corporate card programs.", "Now I'd like to turn to Slide 17 and review the residential mortgage portfolio. There are two important messages to take away from this slide. First, mortgage balances declined in all products except the core portfolio. The highest risk products, I'll take firsts and seconds, and lot loans have declined to less than 2% of loans and should not drive large changes in our credit quality numbers going forward.", "The second take away is that delinquencies improved for all mortgage products except home equity loans and prime seconds. The increase for the home equity loans was fairly modest in dollars and for prime seconds, although the delinquency rate increased and the dollars past due actually declined. The Altay products had the most dramatic drop in delinquencies with a 60 plus ratios dropping by a third despite continued declines in outstanding balances.", "Further, all delinquency buckets up to 150 days past due showed improvement for both the Altay first and second mortgage products. We expect the seasonality to drive some delinquency reductions but the Altay improvements were much stronger than one would expect from normal seasonal trends. ", "Non performing mortgage loans increased in the first quarter to about $2 billion. This was not unexpected given the level of our mortgage exposure in Florida, a judicial foreclosure state and the foreclosure moratoriums.", "Last quarter we provided a review of the prime second portfolio insurance profile, and our expectation that most of the pulls would reach the first level insurance cap in 2009. We have added to the allowance to cover the losses we currently expect. As a reminder, SunTrust bears any pull cumulative losses from 5% to 8% and insurance applies again to cumulative losses up to 10%. SunTrust bears the risk of loss in each pool for cumulative losses exceeding 10%.", "At the end of the first quarter, we reserved for our exposure in the 5% to 8% range. 2006 and 2007 vintages are performing the worst and we expect to record increased charge offs on these portfolios in the second quarter.", "Now let's talk about home equity lines on Slide 18. Home equity credit performance is for the most part driven by the two highest risk segments in the portfolio; lines originated by third parties and lines in Florida exceeding 80% combined loan to value.", "These two segments account for just 22% of our outstanding's which generated a disproportionate amount of charge offs and non accruals. There's virtually no line of availability remaining in these two segments, nor for that matter in the portfolio of Florida non equity lines over 90% combined loan to value.", "Now let's look at the $11 billion of the portfolio that is exhibiting better performance. First, non accruals increased again in this quarter because there is recoverable value in these loans as opposed to full balance charge offs. More loans in this segment have lower loan to value ratios and there's a higher level of first lien positions so instead of charging them off, we are pursuing recoveries.", "This creates a higher level of non accruals. However, consistent with our policy, we are writing the value down for realizable market value at 180 days past due.", "You may also note that balances have increased in this portion of the portfolio the last few quarters. These increases are primarily from new originations and is consistent with our commitment to continue to extend loans to credit worthy borrowers.", "Although past dues are not referenced on the slide I want to point out that the consumer delinquency improvement I've already noted in residential mortgages also extends to the Heloc portfolio. In February and March, we saw material improvement in all early delinquency buckets up to an including 90 to 120 days past due and the positive trends appear to be continuing in April.", "Now if you turn to Slide 19, I'll provide a bit more detail about our mortgage and Heloc portfolios. The first thing you will see on this new slide is current FICO are really strong for both mortgage and Heloc portfolios. If you adjust for non performing loans the scores are even stronger.", "Next is the conservative loan to values at origination. The point that's most evident on this slide is the impact our mortgage and Heloc concentrations in Florida have on non performing loans. The comparatively poor performance of the accounts in Florida, where delinquency rates are twice the levels of the rest of the portfolio, combined with a foreclosure timetable that averages 12 months are driving the high MPL levels in Florida and the portfolio overall.", "Now let's look at our construction exposure on Slide 20. As expected, and continuing a multi quarter trend, construction outstanding's declined significantly in the first quarter and now stand at just over $9 billion. Balances declined 8% this quarter and were down 34% since December 2007. Construction loans now comprise just over 7% of SunTrust's total loan portfolio.", "The annualized charge off ratio increased to 3.76% due to the decline in balances. Construction term loans continued to decline and down over 65% from their peak in July of 2007. This portfolio should continue to run off and credit quality should improve as more than 50% of the performer portfolio was originated under new credit standards since October of 2007.", "Of the older, pre-October 2007 performing portfolio, 95% has matured or will mature within five months. A significant part of the non performing construction loans has been through the write down process with an average write down of 18% to 20%.", "The residential builder portfolio continues to be great area for us given the residential construction, A&D and land loans in the portfolio. Balances are down $389 million or 8.6% in the first quarter, while non performing loans increased by $175 million or roughly 20%.", "Based on the increase in non performing loans and our continued efforts to move loans through the work out process, we expect residential construction charge offs will be at current or higher levels in the second quarter. Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio continues to be stable.", "Balances declined $211 million or 5.8% in the quarter. While first quarter charge offs were up, they were comprised of a few relatively small occurrences. As we showed last quarter, the portfolio is well diversified by geography and product type.", "Let me summarize today's credit discussion before turning the call over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 21.  Overall the credit environment has not changed a great deal in the last three months. Asset quality deteriorated in the first quarter; however we are seeing some positive signs in consumer and mortgage delinquencies.", "Although we expect that seasonality played a role, we believe our enhanced default management practices also contributed to the improvement. We are seeing some weakening in the C&I book, notably in industry sectors most impacted by the residential and construction decline and by reductions in consumer spending, but overall the C&I portfolio is well diversified and performance is satisfactory given the recessionary environment.", "Over half of the non performing loans are residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit and two thirds of the residential mortgage MPL's are currently carried at estimated recoverable value. The residential and Heloc portfolios are prime portfolios underwritten with solid borrower credit scores but performance of both segments is disproportionally influenced by concentrations in Florida real estate.", "The construction portfolio is performing as expected with the majority of the deterioration in residential related categories, while commercial is holding up well. Balances declined significantly over 34% in the last 15 months and 8% in the last quarter.  ", "The impact of the recession is beginning to show up in commercial and commercial real estate portfolio asset quality. The commercial portfolios are broadly diversified. They are performing well given the environment. We increased the allowance for loan losses to 2.21% of loans during the quarter. The increase was driven largely by continued weakness in the residential real estate consumer portfolios and by the classification change to include fraud related loan losses in reserves going forward.", "Credit losses are expected to increase in the second quarter given the classification change related to fraud losses combined with continued deterioration in residential construction and cyclically sensitive commercial exposures. However, our outlook for higher second quarter losses should not be taken as a need for future reserve addition.", "Now I'll turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Shriner", "Before we open up the lines for calls, I'd like to remind you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. We're ready to take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first call comes from Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I'm trying to think about your ability to earn your way through this cycle, and I think about it in two ways; first just implicitly the reserve to MPA ratio at 50% and second pre provision earnings in the $700 million to $800 million range this quarter versus MPA formation in four and when I say MPA formation, MPA growth plus charge offs in the quarter. I know everyone thinks about that a little different, but in both cases it would seem like 50% is a very important metric, i.e. the severities on problem loans are less than 50%, you're kind of okay because you can just earn your way through this and it will be painful, and if severities are more than 50% then it would be more problematic. So can you give us some data points around what you're seeing in actual dispositions, loan sales, some metrics to get comfortable that severities on the MPA book and the new MPA's that are forming are below 50% and therefore, you can earn your way through this and is that a fair way to think about it?", "James Wells", "First of all as I believe we've talked about in previous quarters, we tried to show our charge off capability and how we're carrying our non performers and how closely those non performers are written down and our ability to continue to sell when we get hold of the properties at the values that we write down to.", "A majority of our loans that go on to non performing are secured by real estate either on the commercial side or primarily houses and coming out of construction loans, or they're single family mortgages, so they're well secured. And as you take a look, we provided you with I think a lot of detail on our charge off rates and our carrying rates in those mortgages.", "We're primarily secured and with that primary security we don't see charge off rates on the portfolios approaching the 50% rate. So I think your thought process around how much earnings potential we need to have to get through the charge offs is not a bad through process. I think our secured nature of almost all of the assets in the portfolio mitigates much of what your concern would be.", "And thirdly, I think we've been fairly successful in identifying the terminal value of the assets and disposing of the assets against the terminal values given that we write them off at 180 days at 85% of the then fair market value. And we continue to write them down where that's required.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "The mortgage re-insurances losses at about $250 million cycle to date, can you remind us what the maximum exposure is or just some metrics around exposure around that book so we can get potential future loss potential?", "Mark Chancy", "The re-insurance reserves we have been building over the course of the past three quarters. We have a combination of both premium income and incremental capital to be depleted if you will in terms of the incremental reserves through this cycle. We have only $20 million or so of incremental capital that can be consumed as a result of these re-insurance reserves but dependant on the level of premiums that we receive; those premiums are likely also to be consumed in terms of the expected losses that are coming from the trusts.", "So to try to give you the exact expense number is challenging but there will be a corresponding revenue item associated with those premiums and so the net effect if you will is approximately $20 million.", "But we basically built the reserve significantly over the course of the past several quarters almost to the full amount, is the bottom line.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford Berstein]", "[Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford Berstein]", "Just following up on the reserve adequacy, I thank you for the disclosure on Slide 26 about the non accruals and residential mortgages. I think it would help us evaluate the reserve adequacy for the entire portfolios of non accruals would be something like this for the total amount of accruals, so could you tell us what percentage of total non accruals are carried at expected recoverable value and what the cumulative write down is.", "James Wells", "The C&I portion of our non performing loans, which is what I think the question is.", "[Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford Berstein]", "For residential construction as well, we would want to know what the mark down to non accruals has been and they flow into non accrual status.", "James Wells", "Those would come in through the residential real estate portfolio line so those have already been marked down in about the 20% to 24% range in terms of what we've been marking those things down on the construction lines. ", "Mark Chancy", "One of the ways to look at that is we take the write down on those commercial type residential loans at the time of foreclosure, so the write down for those is primarily still in the reserve and if they're larger loans, it's in the specific cap loan by loan reserve as opposed to having been written down. So it's not an apples to apples comparison which is one of the reasons why we have not provided that detail on the commercial portfolios since they're fundamentally not accounted for under the same as the consumer real estate secured loans.", "James Wells", "A follow up portion to that question would be we have a relatively substantial element of 114 reserves. The 114 reserves on the commercial side of the portfolio is, we build the reserves for every one of the loans over $4 million in the portfolio on a net cash flow basis and fully reserve for those losses within the loan loss reserve.", "[Kevin St. Pierre \u2013 Sanford Berstein]", "So for hypothetically for a large residential construction credit that would come in the amount reflected in non accrual is the outstanding principal balance.", "James Wells", "That is correct. Within the reserve there is a specific reserve against that loan if we believe the cash flows are the value of the assets are insufficient to repay the loan.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "The simple question is where do you expect MPA's and charge offs to go in the second quarter and the sub question would be, you mentioned seasonality, what did you mean by that? REO, how do we know that marks the level or how do you know it's marked at the right level, and you said 30 days delinquencies are good predictors to make you feel better, but it didn't seem to be a good predictor last year because it didn't go up so much and yet charge offs and MPA's still went up. I'm really just trying to get where you think your problem assets go in the next quarter or two.", "Mark Chancy", "First of all, we're not providing specific guidance as it relates to MPA's and charge offs. We did however end the presentation this morning talking about a specific increase that we do expect relative to the current run rate which relates to the reclassification of the borrower and his representation of fraud losses into charge offs which we believe will be approximately $100 million increase to the run rate that we currently are experiencing in over all charge offs.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "That would be a permanent step up?", "Mark Chancy", "No, not a permanent step up. It's just based on our current volume of losses coming from loans that had historically been characterized as operating losses because they had some level of misrepresentation. We're just giving you some detail on that category as it moves from the income statement and the operating loss segment over to provision expense.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "If you had done that this quarter, what would the impact have been?", "Mark Chancy", "I don't have that number. Let me grab that for you while Tom's commenting on MPA's and we'll get back to you at the end of the comment.", "Tom Freeman", "Can you give me the elements of your one question again?", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Just 30 day delinquencies were not a good predictor of the loan problems last year so I guess I wondering if that really is such a good predictor for future MPA's or future charge offs because it wasn't a good predictor last year.", "Tom Freeman", "30 day delinquencies on the consumer side of the portfolio I think are probably the best predictor of what's going on within the rules and account of the number of mortgages or other consumer products that would go on. The billed and non performers as the 30 day delinquencies continue to build during the period of time came upon us specifically in the fourth quarter with a rush in the fourth quarter.", "What we're seeing is a mitigation across all products and all vintages up to about 150 days. We've seen some real improvement around that. First quarter has historically be for consumer products a time when you have an improvement in delinquencies. We were not expecting a substantial improvement in delinquencies given the general degradation in the economy so we're somewhat surprised by the improvement during the quarter.", "If in fact this improvement keeps up, the number of loans moving into delinquent status and therefore our ultimate charge offs will fall later in the year and so while we haven't yet rolled through our forecasting models and the rest of it, these improvements, they're relatively, we can see some improvement in the second half of the year if the second quarter looks anything like the first quarter.", "Steve Shriner", "To go back to the question, if you look at Slide 13 under operating loss written off, you see the credit there, the $164.6 million in reduction. That's the reserve release related to those, so that's what would have flowed through charge offs, but as Mark also mentioned, we charged off a backlog of disputed claim denials which is why we provided the additional statement that we really only expected to go about $100 million in the next quarter because there was some work through of those disputed claims.", "Mark Chancy", "You had one more element to your question.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA", "Just the REO prices, you're hearing that a lot of properties aren't selling. You have $594 million or REO. How do we as investors know that that's marked down to the right level and how do you know that that's been marked down to the right level if there aren't a lot of transactions in certain categories?", "Tom Freeman", "I think the control structure around that is basically on a monthly basis. We take a look at the REO balance to charge off amounts and ensure that we're holding the REO balance against the charge off amounts and we're required not only for our controllers group and our internal audit group, but also for our outside auditors to verify that we are in fact have a fair holding value for the assets.", "Mark Chancy", "And the disposal on the assets themselves when they're disposed has been elongated but they're very close to the carrying value at that time so the net gain or loss is relatively modest.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Scott Valentin- Fdr Capital Markets.", "Scott Valentin - Fdr Capital Markets", "A question on national credits, there was a west coast bank that had some problems this quarter in their portfolio and I was wondering if you could remind us how big your national shared credit portfolio is, the current performance, geographic exposure, maybe any industry concentrations.", "Mark Chancy", "I don't have those specific numbers in front of me in terms of the shared national credit. We are just beginning the shared national credit exposure at the moment. Much of large corporate exposure in within the shared national credit umbrella. In terms of the number of lead credits where we have where we would be exposed to criticism by the regulatory agencies is a relatively small amount. ", "We independently review rates and determine performance within each one of those credit going forward. We're not anticipating a big movement coming out the shared national credit.", "Tom Freeman", "If you look at last quarter's presentation, there was a pie chart in the S&I slide that showed you the geographic breakdown of our credit. There was a national portion of that and that would include the portion of the large corporate loans and sub set of that would be the book.", "Scott Valentin - Fdr Capital Markets", "In terms of loan modification both on C&I and commercial real estate, has there been a pick up in borrower contacts trying to modify loans given where commercial real estate prices are and how do you feel if a borrower came to you, properties cash flowing with the LTV now is much higher. What are the options in that situation?", "Mark Chancy", "Our mitigation activity continues apace. We're doing I think a very good job for our clients. We're doing many thousands of modifications on a quarterly basis on the consumer side. On the commercial side, we're not having to do substantial amounts of modifications on the commercial real estate side other than within the home builder portfolio.", "We generally work with our clients. We support them where required. If they continue to have the capability to make their loan payment, we'll continue to support them in an appropriate manner. We don't have a big problem in our commercial real estate book.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jefferson Harralson \u2013 KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson \u2013 KBW", "I had a question on Page 13. It looks like the total expense this quarter was $213 million and I think I hear you saying that the normalized number is $10 million to $20 million and you're saying you expect expense to be $100 million next quarter. Is that hearing the comments correctly?", "Tom Freeman", "Not quite. Basically what we said is the top box is operating loss expense and you see a $22.6 number, you should be thinking of operating losses in the $10 million $25 million range going forward assuming no high volatility. And then of the $173 million of what we added to the reserve, the portion that we would expect to write off in charge offs next quarter was roughly the $100 million number that Mark mentioned.", "Jefferson Harralson \u2013 KBW", "So that's why you had overall reserve build there.", "Tom Freeman", "Correct.", "Jefferson Harralson \u2013 KBW", "Let me ask you about the cap programs. I know we're on the eve of you receiving information about the stress tests, do you think the cap program has an interesting six month insurance policy or is it just kind of government interference you don't want or is it something else?", "James Wells", "As soon as we are through the federal examination that the stress tests are, we would know the answers to all of that, and until we do, we don't know. And we'll just have to see how it goes.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

", "I would now like to turn the meeting over to Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir, you may begin. ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Good morning, and welcome to SunTrust Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. In addition to the press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the focus for our call today, updates on the progress for shareholder value initiatives including our efficiency and productivity program, the impact they had on the second quarter of earnings and a summary of key credit trends. ", "The press release, presentation and the detailed financial schedules are available on our website SunTrust.com. This information can be accessed directly today by using the quick link on the SunTrust.com home page entitled Second Quarter Earnings Release or by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. ", "With me today, among members of our executive Management team are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer and Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer. Jim will start the call with a discussion around our progress on the shareholder value initiatives. Mark will follow with details on the quarter's earnings and the impact the initiatives had on the company's financial performance and I will conclude with details around recent credit trends and how they impact our view on the credit picture for the remainder of this year. We will then open the session for questions. ", "First, I will remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website. Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date forward-looking statements are made, and we disclaim any responsibility to do so. ", "During the call we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the Company's performance.

", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. ", "With that let me turn it over to Jim. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, and good morning, all. As you saw on our press release this morning we reported earnings per share for the second quarter of $1.89, which include a $0.41 per share benefit from the gain on the sale of the 4.5 million shares of Coca Cola stock. Excluding the gain, earnings per share was $1.48 for the quarter. Mark Chancy will be discussing the details of these results shortly, but in summary, excluding the impact of the Coke gain, the company generated strong revenue growth of nearly 14% over the first quarter on a linked annualized basis. ", "Growth was driven by double-digit increases in net interest and fee income and that coupled with strong expense control, generated positive operating leverage for the quarter. It's helped to offset higher credit cost. ", "Significant progress we made on the initiatives to drive shareholder value, which we announced in mid-May had of profound impact on the quarter's results. As you may recall, we announced in May that we have recently accelerated and expanded a number of strategies designed to enhance shareholder value. These are summarized on page two of the earnings presentation, as well as the progress we've made on each one of them. As we discuss the progress and the impact of each of these initiatives it's having on our financial performance, I think you will get a sense of the dedicated and detailed effort the company is making to ensure that we are successful in each of these areas and the commitment we have to drive higher shareholder value. ", "Balance sheet management strategies along with investments in our high growth business helped by revenue growth in the quarter and our E-squared initiatives were largely responsible for keeping expense growth minimal. The positive operating leverage generated in the quarter helped offset the impact of higher credit cost, related to the normalization of credit trends from historically low levels and the negative impact that deterioration of certain segments of the consumer real estate market is having on our credit costs. Greg will spend some time on credit later on the call. ", "I will spend my time today, outlining the significant progress we made on our efficiency and productivity initiatives. Mark will then follow up with a discussion on the positive impact that the balance sheet management and capital optimization strategies that had on the quarter. ", "As we began the implementation of the E-squared initiatives, it become evidence that we could go deeper and faster than our initial projections indicate. our momentum to-date and analysis confirm this, and as a result we significantly expanded the initiative. We increase the targeted cost savings to $530 million for fiscal year 2009, which is depicted on page three of our presentation. This represents over 10% of our current expense base. In addition, we accelerated the implementation of this initiative with expected savings in 2007, increasing from a $135 million to $181 million, and in 2008 from $205 million to $350 million. ", "We\u2019ve already had a high degree of success with this program. As you can see on page four of the presentation deck, our cost savings in the first and second quarter totaled $80.6 million with $51.8 million in cost savings achieved in the second quarter alone. ", "Let me take a minute to walk through some of the recent initiatives and wins associated with this program, specifically in the areas of corporate real estate, process reengineering and organizational review. These are depicted on page five of the presentation. ", "Our recent decision to accelerate our E-squared initiatives and ultimately to drive greater shareholder value is due in part to early successes in several initiatives. First I will talk about corporate real estate. ", "Our work in corporate real estate is an excellent example of how we are achieving significant cost savings by rethinking how we do things across the footprint. In rethinking how we utilize office space, we are effectively reducing our utilization by over 20%. Our corporate real estate efforts are aimed at using office space more efficiently by identifying and eliminating under utilized space and employing new space standards as well. All new buildings are being built with these revised standards and we are retrofitting existing buildings to our new space standards in an orderly and systematic manner. ", "We've completed four large property transactions that involve both sell and lease back transactions as well as renegotiated longer-term leases. The most recent of these is the sale of our Laurel Maryland office building, which closed in late June. The space planning evaluation reveled that we could reduce our square footage requirement in that one building by about 35%. That transaction coupled with those completed and mentioned earlier in Atlanta Memphis and Orlando, represent aggregate annual savings of about $13 million or 50% per year. ", "Furthermore on June 15, we announced our intent to employ a sale and lease back strategy involving approximately 475 facilities throughout our southeast and in our mid-Atlantic footprint. This strategy will lower overall occupancy expense and reduce under utilized office space. ", "We are currently marketing the 49 office buildings and 425 retail branches to developers, brokers, real estate investment trust and other institutional investments. There are currently almost 500 registered interested parties that represent a balance of institutional, private and individual investors. Final bids are due by late September and we anticipate closings to occur by the year-end. ", "Next I\u2019d like to take a moment to discuss progress reengineering. For example, we have recently begun our process reengineering efforts around the wholesale and credit side of the company. We've formed what we are calling credit resource centers that will transform the commercial lending process. These credit resource centers or CRCs will leverage existing capabilities, infrastructure and processes to provide a streamlined and centralized loan closing and application process for clients with total borrower exposure of 2.5 million or less regardless of the customer revenue size. ", "As a result of streamlined credit processes, our clients, employees and shareholders can expect to see an improved client experience and the elimination of the administrative task from the relationship managers, which will free them up to focus on client management and new client acquisition. We\u2019ll also see reduced headcount and expenses. Bottom line, it will be much easier to do business with us, both internally and externally, and costs will be reduced. ", "Our first pilot of this concept was in the Central Florida region and it has been quite successful. We\u2019ve recently rolled out additional pilots in the Georgia, Central Virginia, and Western Virginia regions and expect similar positive results there. And we expect to roll out this new process to the rest of the organization by year-end \u201907. ", "The third E-squared initiative that has recently made significant progress is our organizational review, which is in full swing and is on track to meet our end summer timeline. In fact, we\u2019ve already announced the changes that will affect our geographic unit. In June, we unveiled a fine tuning of that structure moving from four groups and 20 regions to more efficient three groups and 17 regions structure. In addition to addressing the group and region structure, we introduced the more efficient approach to layers of management and spans of control. ", "We are also centralizing several back office operations and functions that have historically been performed at the region or group level and we will thereby gain consistency as well as scale. ", "So in summary, successful execution of our efficiency and productivity program is already yielding a reduction in the rate at which our core expenses are growing. And you can see this outlined on page six of the deck. As we noted previously we need the fund certain costs related to implementing the program. These expenses offset a portion of the achieved cost saves and we expect the proportion of investment to total growth saving will decline in 2008 to 2009. The total implementation cost incur this quarter amounted to approximately $12 million, bringing implementation cost incurred thus far in 2007 to just over $26 million. As we previously articulated, these costs are for the most part, exclusive of severance expense. We should have greater insight as to the amount of severance expense, what amount will occur as it relates to our organizational review efforts between now and late August. And we plan to update the pubic then on these developments. ", "I am very pleased to announce that excluding the impact of the initial implementation cost and some additional items that are not part of our core expense base, which we show on page six, expenses were up less than 1% in the first half of 2007, compared to the first half of 2006. This is a reflection of the powerful impact that E-square initiatives are already producing. Including those noted items, expenses were up 2% over the same timeframe. ", "Our efforts are aimed at improving efficiency in productivity, but not at the expense of our revenue generating capability. It is increasingly important to ensure that we continue to invest in areas, where we believe we have the greatest revenue growth potential. Mark will spend a few minutes outlining how these investments helped drive revenue growth in the quarter. ", "So in summary, we are very focused on growing revenue, controlling expense growth by driving higher cost savings and making the balance sheet more efficient as well as optimizing our capital structure and therefore retuning a high rate of capital to our shareholders. The accomplishment of these objectives is how the company intends to drive higher shareholder value, as we move forward. ", "With that I will turn the call over to Mark, who will give you some insight on the progress we made on the balance sheet and capital management strategies and the impact they had as well as other details on the quarter. Mark? ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Excuse me. Thanks, Jim and good morning. As Jim noted in his outline on page seven of our earnings presentation, we reported earnings per share of $1.89 for the second quarter this morning which included a $0.41 benefit from the gain on sale of 4.5 million shares of stock. The after tax gain on the sale was a $146 million; so excluding the gain, earnings per share was $1.48. Jim has covered our progress on the cost savings front and the positive impact it is having on controlling expense growth. The purpose of my conversation will be centered on our other initiatives, namely the balance sheet management and capital optimization strategies, and the impact that they had on the quarter. I'll also highlight some of our other developments that occurred, which impacted our results. ", "I'll start with the balance sheet management strategies that we executed in the first and second quarters. As you may recall we announced in our first quarter earnings call that we initiated a substantial balance sheet reposition. Given the challenging economic environment with no improvement in sight, the company intensified its balance sheet management efforts in the first quarter. A comprehensive review of the company's loan and investment portfolios was conducted in which we analyzed a number of portfolio characteristics, including size, liquidity, customer collateral needs, credit and interest rate exposure and capital consumption. ", "The conclusion was that it would be advantageous to significantly reduce the overall size of the loan and investment portfolios, as well as modify the company's investment portfolio to reduce the amounts of securities with credit exposure, increase the use of short term government securities to satisfy those collateral needs, chip the [ph] portfolio of securities it will have lower risk ratings to consume less Tier 1 capital and increase the use of derivatives to manage duration and overall interest rate risk. We also decided to view loan classes through the same type of lens in determining whether to hold them in portfolio or sell them into the secondary markets. ", "As a result of this review we decided to sell approximately $16 billion of available for sale investment securities. Purchase $5 billion in mortgage backed securities with a longer duration and place them in the AFS portfolio and purchase approximately $7 billion in short term T-Bills that would be held in the trading account, pledging needs and the customer deposit and repobo [ph]. In addition to this, we entered into $7.5 billion of receipt fixed interest rate swaps to maintain the company's overall balance sheet duration. ", "On the loan side the company reduced the size of its corporate loan book by approximately $2 billion, restructured asset sale of lower yielding large corporate loans. In the mortgage portfolio, $4.1 billion of adjustable rate mortgages were transferred to loans held for sale for subsequent sale in the second and third quarters. And these transactions were all completed with the exception of only approximately $1 billion of the mortgages that had not been sold by the end of the second quarter. ", "This repositioning had a significant effect on the company's second quarter results. And I'll start with the impact on fully taxable equivalent net interest income which increased $32 million or 11% on a sequential annualized basis over the first quarter. The increase was driven by the yield enhancement achieved for the repositioning, as well as reducing the level of higher cost wholesale funding for de-leveraging the balance sheet. The average yield on the $16 billion in securities sold was approximately 4.6% and the yield on the mortgage backed securities, T-Bills and receipt fixed interest rates swaps that we purchased ranged from 5% to 5.9%. Mortgages sold in the second quarter had an average yield of approximately 4.95%, below the 5.35% incremental wholesale funding rate. The combination of the yield improvement and the de-leveraging accounted for nearly all the growth in net interest income during the quarter. As a direct result of these actions, net interest margin also improved 8 basis points to 3.1% in the second quarter, the second consecutive 8 basis points sequential quarter increase. A number of key financial metrics also improved as a result of the repositioning, coupled with the impact of our cost save initiatives, as you can see on Page nine of the presentation. ", "Looking at these ratios without the impact of the Coke stock gain, return on assets, return on equity and the efficiency ratio, all improved. Another improvement that is not as visible in the quarter end numbers is the amount of capital flexibility we gained from the repositioning and the sale of the Coke stock. Although the estimated Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the second quarter did not change significantly from the first quarter level, we estimate that Tier 1 ratio was approaching 8%, as we completed most of the repositioning during the second quarter. Given our Tier 1 target of 7.5% this provided us with a significant capital management opportunity which we exercised through an accelerated share repurchase agreement the company entered into in the second quarter with $800 million in shares repurchased on June 7. Company also purchased roughly 50 million in stock through open market purchases during the quarter prior to the AFSR. ", "In connection with the accelerated share repurchase, 8 million shares repurchased in June and up to 1.7 million additional shares will be repurchased upon completion of the program dependent upon the stock price during the period the AFSR is open which is now expected to conclude in late August. $850 million in total shares repurchase falls squarely within our stated goal of repurchasing $750 million to $1 billion in shares this year, as part of our shareholder value initiatives. As you know, historically the company has returned 70% to 80% of its earnings to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and this is our long term goal going forward. In 2006, we exceeded this target by returning over 90% of our earnings to shareholders and we expect to be near this level this year through a combination of a 20% increase in our dividend and the shares that we have repurchased. Future repurchases this year will also be dependant upon any additional capital flexibility in the remainder of the year through balance sheet management activities and could be influenced by the ultimate strategy we pursue regarding our remaining Coke holdings. ", "Now regarding Coke, during the quarter as you know we sold part of the capital inefficient portion of our holdings. Now that's the portion that we deemed that could not be leveraged in our business, doesn't receive any current capital credit from the regulators or rating agencies and wasn't pledged for other business purposes. We spent a good deal of effort analyzing various options during the quarter for the remaining holdings in the context of capital optimization and at the end of the quarter, we held nearly 44 million shares with an after tax value of approximately $1.4 billion. We are still in the process of evaluating options including tax advantage strategies and we'll continue to study these alternatives over the coming months as well as work with the various constituencies we need to, including our regulators and the rating agencies to get the appropriate feedback as we finalize our strategy. ", "As we announced in May, we will be providing details to the investment community around our ultimate strategy by year-end, if not sooner. But at this point we are not in a position to discuss any specifics regarding the ultimate resolution. ", "Now I am going to shift gears and take a few minutes to cover key trends in other areas, starting with the balance sheet and loans in particular. Balance sheet management strategies that have resulted in loan sales masked the true rate of loan growth the company has generated. Since the second quarter of 2006, the company sold nearly $10 billion of mortgage, student and corporate loans. Excluding this impact, underlying loan growth was solid in the second quarter of 2007 compared to the second quarter of 2006 as it was on a sequential annualized basis. Growth was fairly evenly distributed across loan categories with the exception of indirect loans, which we had been intentionally running down based on their lower risk return profile given where spreads have been in that business over the past couple of years. ", "We've also intentionally slowed mortgage growth over the past three quarters given tightening spreads and the concentration of mortgages on the balance sheet. Although consumer and commercial deposit growth was only 1% on both the year over year basis and a sequential quarter basis, we did see growth in demand deposits of 8% and NOW account balances of 5% on a sequential annualized basis, areas where we have been focused on our deposit initiatives. Whether this increase is sustainable is difficult to tell at this point, as we typically experienced a degree of seasonality that negatively affects the balances in these products in the third quarter. Nonetheless the growth was beneficial to our results during the second quarter. ", "Part of our deposit strategy is core checking acquisition, and we have promotions this fall especially designed to attract consumer and business core checking accounts and to cross sell deeper into existing households. ", "Now shifting to the income statement. I have already covered the reasons for net interest income growth. The other side of the revenue equation, non-interest income grew nicely, both year over year and on a linked quarter basis. Non-interest income grew 32% over the second quarter of 2006; if we exclude the impact of the Coke stock deal non interest income grew about 5%. ", "On a sequential annualized basis, non-interest income excluding the impact of the Coke stock grew about 19%. Solid growth was evident across most categories. As we have outlined previously, the Company is making investments in areas where we believe to have the greatest revenue growth potential in the future and we are seeing the impact of these investments in certain areas. We have been investing in certain high growth segments of the wealth and investment management segment of our business. And as a direct result of these investments, made to expand our sales force, we significantly expanded annuity sales thereby pushing retail investment income higher this quarter. ", "Investments made in debt capital markets helped drive solid growth in investment banking income as both syndicated finance and securitizations were up strongly this quarter. Furthermore, mortgage related income grew significantly over last quarter, also reflecting investments made during the past few years in this business. I will spend a moment outlining mortgage related income shortly. ", "Other items of note that helped drive growth in non-interest income include interchange fees, which drove part the income and gains on private equity investments and structured leasing transactions, which contributed to other non-interest income growth. Regarding the gains on private equity investments, we realized a $23 million gain on one private equity investment transaction. Taking into account the related expense on the transaction, the net pretax impact was $9 million\u2026 $19 million or $12 million after tax. The decline of $74 million in trading income from the first to the second quarter is mainly attributable to the net positive impact that the fair value adoption for certain areas had on trading income in the first quarter. The sequential quarter decline interest income is due to the merger of Light House Partners into Light House Investment Partners in the first quarter of 2007. Excluding this impact there would have been a low double digit annualized sequential quarter growth in trust and investment management income. ", "The last area I will cover in non-interest income is mortgage related. Mortgage production related income is up $73 million from the first quarter due to a number of factors. Fair value adoption in the first quarter negatively impacted production related income by approximately $44 million in the first quarter, an impact that we had indicated would not be repeated in future quarters. Taking this into account, production income was still up $29 million over the first quarter and the increase was driven by a number of things, including record mortgage production of $18 billion in the second quarter, a 21% increase over the first quarter. ", "Income associated with the sale of nearly $3 billion in portfolio loans held at fair value and the benefit from the election in May to record certain newly originated mortgage loans held for sale at fair value. Now, this election impacts the timing of recognition of origination fees and costs as well as servicing value. Specifically, origination fees and costs, which had been deferred and recognized as part of the gain or loss on the sale of the loan are now recognized in earnings at the time of origination. Servicing value, which had been recorded at the time the loan was sold, is now included in the fair value of the loan and recognized at origination. ", "So, while mortgage production related income benefited from the adoption, a partial offset to this was the $12 million increase in non-interest expense, more specifically, compensation expense, as we no longer defer origination costs on these loans. The negative impact on non-interest expense was reported on page six of the presentation that Jim covered earlier. ", "Mortgage servicing related income was up $10 million due mainly to a gain on sale of MSRs totaling $11.6 million in the second quarter. Given the continued growth in our MSR asset, which has grown 24% or $29 billion to over $150 billion over the past year and the recent increase in interest rates, this was an opportune time from both a risk management and market standpoint to realize a portion of the gains that we currently had in this asset. I will note that the gain we took in the second quarter was lower than the gains we took in the first, second and third quarters of last year. It is also the first MSR gain we have taken in 2007, compared to the $66 million in total gains that we took during the course of 2006. ", "The sale is consistent with the approach that we took during 2006 that is, selling what we deem to be higher risk areas of the servicing portfolio, such as excess servicing rights for servicing that is out of footprint. We would expect going forward that we will continue to view this on an opportunistic basis and as part of our balanced business approach in the mortgage line of business. ", "So, to sum it up, the shareholder value initiatives that we have undertaken had a significant positive impact on our performance in the second quarter. And we expect this will continue in future periods as we make additional progress in areas we have already identified and diligently pursue additional opportunities, going forward. ", "That covers the earnings picture. So I will turn it back to\u2026 over to Greg to discuss the credit environment. ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks Mark. The preview of the credit highlights for the second quarter is included on page 10 of the presentation. Although the companies credit picture continues to be solid, we did see credit losses continue to normalize in addition to the negative impact from the deterioration of certain segments of the consumer real estate market during the second quarter. Annualizing that charge-off to total loan increased from 21 basis points in the first quarter to 30 basis points in the second quarter and did exceed our expectations for the quarter. As a result, we have updated our net charge-off expectations for the year, which I will cover later. ", "We have stated in our external discussions there over the past several quarters, we have been expecting normalization in credit loss levels and have seen that plateau over the past year. Trends in net charge-offs to total loan has been increasing from a historically unsustainable loss rates in the first half of 2006, when they were running in eight to 10 basis point range. The net charge-off level has suddenly increased from that point to the 30 basis point level we reported this morning. ", "As I noted, the net charge-off ratio did exceed our expectations for the second quarter. Our expectation was that the net charge-off ratio for the quarter has grown somewhat above the high-end of our outlook range for 2007 of 20 basis points. The $6 billion in mortgage and corporate loans sold and/or designated for sale late in the first quarter resulted in a smaller average loan base for the second quarter, and had the effect of increasing the annualized net charge-off ratio one to two basis points. The remainder of the increase was driven by three areas, commercial, home equity loans and residential mortgages, most notably in Alt-A products. ", "Increase in commercial charge-offs, which includes corporate and commercial loans was driven by the need to charge off several smaller commercial and corporate credits during the quarter. By their nature commercial charge are volatile. In the last quarter, we experienced a high number of these smaller credits being charged off in prior quarters. To give you a feel for the relatively small size of the individual credits that carry the highest near-term loss potential, net accruals loans in the company\u2019s commercial portfolio, the average size of the 25 largest non-performing commercial entity is only $3.3 million. These loans represent 90% of our total non-performing commercial loan base. ", "To sum up the commercial credit picture, what occurred in the second quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the trends in commercial charge-offs going forward. The overall credit quality of the portfolio continues to be solid. Again, predictability and the timing of loan specific charge-offs makes it difficult to predict how aggregate quarter-by\u2026 how the aggregate quarter-by-quarter trend would look. Home equity loan annualized net charge-offs were 64 basis points in the second quarter. They have followed the trend somewhere to the overall net charge-off levels coming off unsustainably low levels of 11 basis points to 12 basis points in the first half of 2006 and steadily increasing from that point. Part of this trend can be attributed to the seasoning of the portfolio. The other element contributing to the increase in charge-offs, the loss experienced on home equity loans that have higher than 90% combined loans package [ph], which is the source of over 50% of our home equity loan charge-offs. While the bulk of our home equity loan portfolio, credit quality continues to be solid, the proportion of the company's portfolio, loan to value is over 90% that's had higher loss experienced to date 2007. While the lower credit performance is confined to certain products, these are not sub prime or Alt-A originated products. They do include a portfolio of higher loan to value lines that were acquired by originating. ", "To give you a feel for the loan to value construct for the home equity loan portfolio, the average combined LTV of the total equity loans portfolio is around 75%. Looking deeper into the portfolio's stratification, nearly 25% of the portfolio is in the first lien position and carry relative low loan to values of slightly over 20% of the portfolio as combined loan to value that\u2019s higher than 90%. The remaining portfolio is centered around the 60% to 90% LTV range. We believe we have priced all risk and higher LTV's with a greater than 90% retail LTV production using 75 basis points to 100 basis points higher end production with LTVs in the 60% to 90% range. ", "Although we feel the risk adjusted returns on the portfolio are appropriate, especially when viewed over the long run, the company has been taking steps to manage risk of higher LTV products. These include restrictions on new hire LTV production, signing underwriting criteria, including reducing maximum loan sizes, tighter debt to income ratios and obtaining mortgage insurance on higher up LTV products. Nearly 90% production has declined over the past two quarters, and that\u2019s more than 90% of the value and is now running at less than 15%. ", "In summary, credit losses in the home equity loan portfolio are attributable to normal portfolio seasoning and higher loss experienced in the greater than 90% higher LTV portfolio. We believe we are priced for this risk\u2026 currently the portfolio, the high risk component of the portfolio, the risk adjustments spread in the portfolio reflect this. Company has also been taking steps to mitigate the ongoing risk of the portfolio. ", "Shifting to residential mortgages, net residential mortgages charge-offs increased in the second quarter with the annualized net charge-off ratio increasing from 15 basis points in the first quarter to 23 basis points in the second. This increase was expected given our higher level of losses we experienced in our Alt-A portfolio, as well as further seasoning of other portfolio. We provided some in-depth detail on the Alt-A portfolio, and Alt-A loans in the warehouse in last quarter's earnings call, and we wanted to provide you an update on some of the key data regarding the products. The Alt-A loans held in our loan portfolio decreased in size for the first quarter from $1.8 billion to $1.7 billion. This is less than 1.5% of our total loan portfolio and 5% of our residential mortgage portfolio. We initiated production of Alt-A in 2004, portfolio-ing a small portion of the production and selling most of it. In the second half of 2006, we began to reduce the volume of Alt-A originated product portfolio and ceased originating Alt-A loans for the portfolio in the first quarter of 2007. Portfolio breakdown between the first lien and the second lien position was 61% first lien and 39% in second lien. Weighted average LTV of the first lien portfolio was 76% and the weighted average FICO score is 71%. ", "Second lien position portfolio has a weighted average combined loan to value of 97% and the weighted average FICO score is 685, slightly less than the first lien average score. We have utilized insurance extensively on the combined LTVs of over 80% and in fact 92% of the second lien Alt-A portfolio is insured. Credit losses on the Alt-A portfolio product did account for over 50% for the residential mortgage charge offs in the second quarter, only at this stage they will stay at this level through year-end. ", "The Alt-A portfolio loans also accounted for nearly 60% of the non-performing residential mortgage loans. We think the balance of non-performing loans will peak in the second half of this year and gradually decline. Non-performing assets which include non-performing loans in other real estate will increase as well and stay at the higher level for the remainder of the year as we work through the loss of mitigation in the February [ph] process. ", "Just into the Alt-A warehouse position, Alt-A loans in the warehouse declined from $883 million as of March 31st to $509 million as of June 30th, a $374 million or a 42% decrease. 97% of the Alt-A loans of the warehouse are first lien loans, credit characteristics of the warehouse are very similar to our first lien portfolio initiatives and reflect the most stringent underwriting guidelines we have been operating under for some time now. ", "The loans in the warehouse have been mark-to-market. The company\u2019s Alt-A production in the second quarter declined only 2% of total production, or $370 million of which all this first lien product is being sold into the secondary market. We are comfortable producing this level of Alt-A loans due to the significantly tighter guidelines we are operating under. For example, we are no longer originating second lien product, loan to values are lower, credit scores are higher. We have tightened the documentation standards, which have resulted in increased levels of full doc loans and minimized the amount of stated incomes, stated asset production. In other words, what is being produced today is at the higher end of the Alt-A structure. ", "Similar to the first quarter, we continue to experience a degree of losses from price adjustments and repurchases and marking the market and selling on top of warehouse. The impact to EPS from these types of losses was $0.05, the same impact they had in the first quarter. Given the fact that the warehouse was mark-to-market, Alt-A production volumes has delivered a higher quality and the early payment default experience on the loans in the warehouse has markedly improved, we expect a negative impact from mark-to-market related losses on loans to the warehouse to lessen in the second half of this year. We continue to closely manage the Alt-A exposure until the situation continues to be manageable given the controls and guidelines that are in place. ", "In summary, our view is that credit will continue to normalize. In certain small areas of the portfolio, losses will continue to ride higher levels in near-term, mainly higher loan to value equity loans in an Alt-A products portfolio. As a result we think the net charge-offs trends for the year will be higher than outlook provided previously. And we expect the net charge-offs rate for the year could be in the 25 basis points to 30 basis points range. ", "This concludes the formal comments of our presentation. We will now start the Q&A. As in previous quarters, each questioner will be allowed one primary question and one follow-up question. If you wish to ask additional questions you can re-enter the questioner queue. ", "Operator, we are ready to take questions. ", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Jennifer Thompson. And please state your company name. ", "Jennifer Thompson - Oppenheimer & Company", "Good morning, Oppenheimer. I'm sorry if I missed this, but there were a lot of numbers being thrown around but could you give us the insurance levels you have right now on the 90% LTV portion of your home equity portfolio? ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Hi Jen, this Greg Ketron. That wasn\u2019t a number that we talked about. We talked about the insured levels we have in the second lien positions of Alt-A but I can tell you we have employed insurance on the loan to values of over 90% of the home equity loan portfolio. That\u2019s the sort of path that we have been going down for a number of months now, and have been insuring portions of that portfolio. But it\u2019s not something that we discussed this morning, that was more targeted on the Alt-A products. ", "Jennifer Thompson - Oppenheimer & Company", "Can you give us a number or even a ballpark, more than half, less than half? ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "It would be less than half. Now, I think what's important to note here is that the FICO scores in greater that 90% part of the portfolio, broadly are pretty strong. So, that is one element that the loan to value situation, it certainly has to be monitored. We're doing that very closely and that\u2019s why we've decided to enter into insurance. To give you an example, in the second quarter, we have insured almost $900 million of 90% of the greater loan to values in the home equity loan portfolio. ", "Jennifer Thompson - Oppenheimer", "Okay. Aside from the high LTV trends, are there any other trends that you are noticing either in home equity or residential, real estate whether that be geographic or other? ", "Thomas E. Freeman - Chief Credit Officer", "Yes, we find the deterioration that we have seen in this product to be non-geographic specific but really product specific. So, it really is the high loan to value product. And certain acquired portfolios through our merger and acquisition activity in pervious years. But the core portfolio of our core lending activity other than the Alt-A and the 90% plus portion of the home equity portfolio is still performing\u2026 we think in a pretty good way and better than industry numbers. ", "Jennifer Thompson - Oppenheimer & Company", "Okay. And just one last question. The reserve ratio has been pretty stable, can you give you give us your current thinking on\u2026 you saw the greater than expected deterioration in the net charge-off ratio this quarter. Just current thinking on the reserve levels? ", "Thomas E. Freeman - Chief Credit Officer", "Again, this is Tom Freeman. We believe our reserve levels\u2026 at current levels as we go through and take a look at forward loss content are more than adequately covered by our current reserve numbers. The two areas where we have been having some charge-off issues, we believe that the Alt-A product is reaching\u2026 it will be reaching it peak in terms of the amount of assets going into our non-performing portfolio within the third quarter. And we believe that we will see some emergence out of that relatively small portfolio of 90% plus second mortgage loans. And that\u2019s more than adequately reserved for in our current provisions. ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Jen, this is Mark. Just as an example at the annualized quarter, we still have about three times coverage of that annualized charge-off level. It\u2019s about three and half times if you take a year-to-date number, just to put that 88 basis points in some perspective. ", "Jennifer Thompson - Oppenheimer & Company", "Great. Thanks very much, guys. ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Jen. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Marinac. Your line is open, please state your company name. ", "Christopher Marinac - Fig Partners", "Hi, Fig Partners in Atlanta. Guys, I was just curious about the residential losses and in just in terms of\u2026 with this loss rate necessarily get higher or do you think this might prove to be a peak level that we saw annualized in the second quarter? ", "Thomas E. Freeman - Chief Credit Officer", "It's Tom Freeman again. We believe in the Alt-A portion of the portfolio, we are about reaching peak levels and believe that we will begin to see those numbers turn down in the third and fourth quarters, and we will have digested most of that in terms of both the loss profile in the third and fourth quarters of this year. I don\u2019t think we have reached quite peak levels yet in some of these smaller home equity positions. We will get some emergence out of that we think in the next two quarters, but don\u2019t believe that in terms of the size of the portfolio, it will be a hugely a significantly number. ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Hey, Chris, this is Greg. One way to look at it too in terms of\u2026 we talked about the Alt-A product in detail and that 50% of the losses are coming from that Alt-A product, if you kill that off, the net charge-offs and you consider we've got $1.4 billion in our mortgage portfolio that is Alt-A, the residual net charge-off levels are in the 10, 12, 13 basis points range. So, that\u2019s accounting for half of that 23, 24 basis points charge-off level that we are seeing in the second quarter. ", "Christopher Marinac - Fig Partners", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jefferson Harralson. Your line is open and please state your company name. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thanks, it\u2019s KBW. I want to ask you about the EPS impact of the accounting change on the mortgage revenue line this quarter. You guys accelerated recognition of fees and the value of the servicing. And you laid out I think to expense impact, but did you also break out the revenue impact and I may missed it. But what was the revenue impact of the accounting change? ", "Greg W. Ketron- Director, Investor Relations", "Jefferson, this Greg. We didn\u2019t give a specific number. What's different about this quarter versus what we saw with the fair value adoption in the last quarter\u2026 and if you remember in our presentation, we exhaustively laid out the EPS impact the fair value impact had because lot of those were non-recurring in nature. In this case, this is a change in the way that we're accounting for the warehouse. And the reason we didn\u2019t point it out necessarily in terms of dollar amount, because there is an ongoing situation here. It's not just going to be a second quarter pick up, it\u2019s not going to be there in future period necessarily. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Okay. And of the $0.02 that the mortgage profits the last quarter, to $0.12, so, maybe it's asking the same question different way, but of that $0.02 to $0.12 increase, can you break out the things that you can break out on gains on loan sold. Or the different areas of profit in the business that you can break out? ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Jefferson, this is Mark. Would you mind rephrasing your question? I didn\u2019t quite understand it. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Last quarter you guys had $0.02 of profit in the mortgage business on a business line basis. This quarter you had $0.12 and I was hoping you guys could maybe discuss that $0.10 increase and where the $0.10 came from. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jefferson, a big piece of that $0.02 last quarter is we had approximately pretax a negative $44 million hit when we put the interest rate block in that amounts [ph] at fair value, that was about $38 million or so. Than we had another hit associated with loan that were designated to held for sale. You know that alone reversed off in the second quarter. ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "We also noted in the comments that we had a significant increase in our production, income related to the record mortgage production of $18 billion we had in the quarter which is up 20%. We also had some positive benefit related to the $3 billion in the portfolio loans that were held for sale and ultimately sold. That\u2019s $3 billion of the $4.1 billion that we moved to fair value that we noted for you last quarter, as well as the acceleration of income that\u2019s associated with the fair value election on the mortgage warehouse. And to Greg's point, when you\u2026 there are lots of puts and takes that related to market value adjustments Greg noted, for example, the market value adjustments as well as the other costs associated with Alt-A production and mark-to-market during the course of the quarter. There was a pick up that was related to the mortgage business as it relates to fair value election but it\u2019s also dependent upon future production levels as to whether or not that level of income continues to grow and/or moderate slightly. So, we feel like the overall production levels are indicative of the company\u2019s future performance, and we continue to gain a market share and feel strongly that our mortgage business is well positioned as we move forward. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "All right. Thank you. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "One other element, Jefferson I would point out is the MSR gain that we had at the second quarter. That was the other piece that drove servicing income to a higher level. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Just to clarify in that point that the MSR gain which was about $12 million during the course of the quarter relative to prior year, that number was $17 million. So, it was actually down $5 million on a year-over-year basis. And we noted that it was the first gain that we have taken in the asset this year given the Verizon rates which are $66 million in total last year and it's something that we are going to continue to evaluate as we move forward given the fact that that servicing portfolio has increased in size so significantly and the embedded market value gain that we have in the out of footprint MSRs, specifically. ", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thanks a lot, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor. Your line open and please state your company name. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "UBS, thank you. There is obviously been a lot of changes on the way boosting efficiency, better managing your expense space and I think just a general inclusive urgency on all fronts. But, obviously we are in the transition period as all these initiatives are underway. Core earnings have been relatively flat. When we do see a gap up in earnings, in these initiatives and how meaningful can it be? ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Matt, as you were mentioning, we've got a number of core initiatives that are already showing progress. We're going to further accelerate those initiatives including our organizational review efforts which we indicated in our release that we would announce in greater detail at the end of August. One of the keys clearly is for the credit environment to moderate some. It\u2019s grown significantly; we had a $50 million increase in provision on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We are pleased that the Company is able to through that. Relatively speaking, we also need to get additional core customer deposit growth, to fuel from a funding standpoint, a further increase in our margins to complement the balance sheet management strategies that we have implemented. So, I would say if you wanted to focus on three things that are keys, one would be the further implementation of our expense and E-Squared initiatives. Second would be seeing the rapid rise in the charge-off level and mirror it some. And then third, getting some good base, low cost deposit growth. And we have a number of key initiatives that we talked about in prior quarters. I can tell you those initiatives are accelerating within the Company including the fall promotions that we referred to earlier that will be beginning year shortly and hopefully we will be positive impacts in the third and fourth quarters. But those would be the three areas, I would point you to. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Matt, this is Jim. I know you would understand this but for the sake if clarity the\u2026 even though we have insulated the revenue producing side from our organizational design efforts of others, there is obviously some effect on focus at certain levels of the organization. And we have begun aggressively on the assumption that, and the belief that and I think proof of this point that the E squared initiatives will go quite well, we will achieve what we have set out to achieve, if not better. We have turned our focus to more aggressive operations of the market on the revenue generation side. ", "So, I think that Mark has answered your question exactly right, but I thought might give you a tone that says E squared is going well. It's now\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s on automatic but it's certainly going well. And we are refocusing our attention totally on the revenue generation side. New client generation is still positive, average balances in deposit accounts are still smaller than they used to be but we think we've got a very fine chance and opportunity inside the market to pursue more aggressive deposit generation. Don\u2019t know how that will go. There is a war for deposits out there. We will have to see how that goes. But the revenue side of the bank is in the nurturing mode and refocused. For example, that\u2019s specifically why we did the geographic part of organizational design, first and it is now essentially over. Just thought you might be interested in just a little color on something. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "No, that\u2019s helpful. I mean I definitely agree that there has been signs of progress in the initiatives. And I guess we are all trying to get our arms around how much of the cost savings might be given away on sort of like credit deterioration and sort of like revenue give up. And what will the bottom-line impact? And as you look all these initiatives underway, how will you evaluate whether or not this is successful in combination, and I assume there is sort of bottom-line target we are trying to get to. ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Well, I think we still say that our longer\u2026 from the Investor Day June of a year ago, we still held with our longer-term objectives. The one difference will be a change in the credit thing but for this year in terms of the outlook. But other than that we are still holding our ground, we believe that in fact when some of these what I would call maybe cyclical or abnormal matters change that we will achieve those and we have every reason to believe we shall. ", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from John Pandtle. Your line is open and please state your company name. ", "John Pandtle - Raymond James", "Good morning. Raymond James. I had a couple of questions. I was wondering if you could share some color on the pretension levels at the branch and on the commercial lending side of the bank. And then separately, I think a lot of people would agree that the stock appears to have a fairly meaningful acquisition premium built in which in some way gives you a currency advantage. And I'm wondering if you can talk about strategically how you are looking at potential acquisition opportunities, as you move forward. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let's see there were three questions in there. We will try to take them maybe out of order but we will get\u2026 this is Gay Abbott. ", "Gay O. Abbott - Commercial Line of Business", "Good morning. On the commercial side of the bank, we are seeing a slight uptick in turnover from the commercial banker side but nowhere near turnover ratios that we might have seen two to three years ago. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "When you mean retention, you're talking about human beings or clients? ", "John Pandtle - Raymond James", "Well, I was really talking about the vendors, the employees. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good, so Gay has answered the right question, good. ", "Gay O. Abbott - Commercial Line of Business", "Well, so we are well within industry standards, we track that every month, that\u2019s something very important to us. So, we feel pretty good about where we are in the commercial side. ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "On the retail side, John. This is Greg. The retention levels we measure it closely and we do all the mystery shopping and do all the stuff [ph] that we do throughout our retail network. The retention levels have remained good, I mean, we have compared ourselves against peers, I mean, they continue to run higher there certainly are areas that we always identify that we would like to improve them across the company, it's not\u2026 doesn\u2019t run\u2026 the higher level you expect company-wide, but I would say on a average, our retention levels have continued to track very well with peers. ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Now with regard to the M&A question, we have stated that we will continue to evaluate opportunities that are presented to us as you would expect us to. We have talked for many years about the fact that we enjoy an outstanding footprint and we don\u2019t want to through acquisition deteriorate that to any significant degree. We have also told you that there are certain markets that are higher growth markets in the southeast, where we could enhance our branch network and particularly in those markets if there were opportunities that became available, we would certainly be remiss if we didn\u2019t evaluate them. The stock price goes up and down, and so we are looking at the long term strategy of the bank and the fundamentals from an evaluation standpoint. But I do want to make sure you are clear, we are going to continue to evaluate opportunities that we find attractive that will help the long-term franchise value as well as the growth of our earnings over the next foreseeable future. ", "John Pandtle - Raymond James", "Okay. And, but Mark with the currency being less than it\u2019s been in years, do you have a greater sense of urgency to take advantage of that? ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well let me\u2026 let me\u2026 this is Jim. Let me take that one. I think our strategy about our footprint as well other as other places, types of transactions we might consider doing has not really changed with the effect on currency. Obviously, it would make it easier in some cases. Prices are still quite elevated in our judgment. So I think you will see us do the same sensible sort of analysis of these transactions or potential transactions we have done in the past. And to reiterate to what Mark said, there are some places where we are thinner than I would like us to be and we would consider doing something, not of a large nature. And while it is nice thing and we are happy with what the stock has been doing, it is up and down and we tend not to change our strategic view of things based on current prices. ", "John Pandtle - Raymond James", "Okay, very good thank you. ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "I think we have time for one more question. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question, our final question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons. Your line is open, and please state your company name. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Sandler O'Neill. Good morning, everyone. ", "James M. Wells III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, good morning Kevin. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "I apologize, I know you did go over this before, but I just didn't get the number down. if you could go over the share buybacks, what you did this quarter, what you are looking out at in terms of. You mentioned the accelerated repurchase plan in August. So what\u2026 what kind of you are looking out for over the back half of the year? Thank you. ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. In connection with the balance sheet management activities what I mentioned was that our Tier 1 capital level was inching up on about 8% and we had already announced that we intended a $750 million to a $1 billion or so share repurchase in the second half of the year. To execute that we conducted about $50 million in repurchases during the second quarter prior to entering into an accelerated share repurchase in early June. Those repurchases, as you know\u2026 well the ultimate number of shares would be predicated on the share price that occurs during the course of that share repurchase period which is June through August. And as result we've repurchased and removed about 8 million shares from the share count in early June and up to 1.7 million shares will be acquired additionally during now to that end of that program. ", "The combination of those two transactions or series of transactions is about $850 million in shares that were repurchased during the course of the second quarter. And we will continue to evaluate our capital position through the remainder of the year and dependant upon additional balance sheet strategies and/or the ultimate resolution of our stock holdings, we may be in a position to add to that share repurchase level. We'd indicated before that our long term goal of return of share\u2026 of earnings through the combination of dividends and repurchases was in that 70% to 80% range. We were north of 90% last year and we're likely to be in that same kind of range this year. And so we'll continue to evaluate as we move forward but that's what we've conducted today. ", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Mark A. Chancy - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you. ", "Gregory W. Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks for joining us on the call today. Please call me if should you have any additional questions. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

Sir, you may begin.", "Steve Shriner", "Good morning, and welcome to SunTrust third quarter 2007 earningsconference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, wehave also provided a presentation that covers the focus of our call today. Youwill hear an overview of the financial results, including market impacts, an updateon our shareholder value initiatives, including our efficiency and productivityprogram, and a detailed view of our credit picture.", "The press release, presentation, and detailed financialschedules, are available on our website www.suntrust.com.

Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter and discussionregarding our progress on the shareholder value initiatives. Mark will becovering financial topics and will provide an in-depth overview of credit, and thenwe will open the session for questions.", "First, I will remind you that our comments today may includeforward-looking statements.

The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located onour website.", "With that let me turn it over to Jim.", "Jim Wells", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Glad you are with us. As yousaw on our press release this morning we reported earnings per share for thethird quarter of a $1.18. Our results included a $0.28 per share negativeimpact on net valuation losses attributable to the recent disruptions of creditand capital markets, and a $45 million or $0.08 per share negative impact of severanceexpenses related to our ongoing E-Square Efficiency and Productivity Program.", "Clearly we were not immune to the deterioration in thehousing market and the related turmoil in the capital markets, as well as thechange on the credit side. However, based on what we have seen so far, we wereimpacted to a lesser extent than many other institutions. It is disappointing,however, that the positive impact of the continuing progress we have made onour initiatives driving net shareholder value was overshadowed by the difficultmarket conditions. In a few moments Mark will detail the impacts of thisenvironment and what it has done to our results this quarter.", "On a positive note regarding our financials, the netinterest income was up 4% over the same quarter last year, but was flat overthe prior quarter. The net interest margin increased 8 basis points from thesecond quarter making this the third consecutive quarter an 8 basis pointmargin expansion.", "This continued improvement is a direct result of theshareholder value initiatives, in particular, the balance sheet managementstrategies we have recently implemented. Notwithstanding our strong creditculture, we did experience higher net charge-offs of 34 basis points, principallyas a result of the change in the credit cycle, and particularly in the consumerportfolio, and we have increased our provision and reserves. We will expand onthis discussion later on the call this morning.", "Non-interest income was down 5% from the same quarter lastyear. As I mentioned, we had a negative impact of a $161 million from the netvaluation losses this quarter. Despite a difficult operating environment, wegrew revenue across a number of areas. Once you peel back the net mark-to-marketadjustment there was underlying growth in trading account profits andcommissions, which were due to stronger customer related trading activities,principally in derivatives and structured leasing. Also, trust and investmentmanagement revenues were up slightly as a result of impacts of enhanced revenueinitiatives.", "However, the comparative growth rate of trust income wasnegatively impacted by the merger of Lighthouse in the first quarter of 2007,as well as the Bond Trustee sale in the third quarter of 2006.", "Additionally there was good growth in service charge income,up 10% and strong annuity sales that drove retail investment services incomegrowth up 28%. Mortgage servicing income increased 56% primarily from growth inthe servicing portfolio.", "Non-interest expense increased 7% from the third quarter oflast year due to a number of significant non-recurring items. Excluding theone-time items, expenses actually grew in the 2.6% range in the quarter andthese results would have been even better that warrant for the increasingexpenses associated with the current credit environment, including increasedoperating losses driven by mortgage related fraud. The low growth rate ofexpenses is a continued reflection of the significant progress we've made on thefundamental initiatives in place to grab shareholder value.", "We have continued with a high degree of success in our E2program. As you can see on page three of the presentation text, cost savings inthe first three quarters totaled $140.1 million with $59.5 million was thatachieved in the third quarter. So, note that we are slightly ahead of our 2007projections.", "At this point, we anticipate that we will exceed ourupwardly revised target of $181 million and estimated cost savings for theyear, but while we are confident that we will achieve our 2008 goal of $350million, it is premature to comment on what an upward revision is appropriate,as there are number of initiatives whose precise timing and benefits are stillbeing developed.", "Needless to say, we are quiet pleased with the results ofall of these efforts and what they are producing. So, I'll take a moment tooutline some of the recent highlights associated with the program. Do recallthat we launched a rigorous internal study of various organizational structuresand processes that included evaluating certain back office functions,consolidating various support functions and reviewing management spans andlayers. We announced in August that we would eliminate approximately 2,400,primarily non-customer contact employee positions by year-end 2008. And aspreviously disclosed, these actions necessitated a third quarter pre-taxone-time charge of $45 million or $0.08 per share.", "Discharge of these positions have been eliminated includingover a 1,000 individuals being notified of position elimination in August. Wewill begin to realize the associated cost savings in the fourth quarter withthe full impact on these position eliminations coming in the first quarter of2008.", "A great deal of the savings associated with ourorganizational review effort stem from streamlining internal processes withmore efficient activities, thereby making it easier to do business with us bothinternally and externally.", " We do this valueelimination of non-client related activity often. It is important to point outthat these changes did not eliminate direct revenue for losing positions. Inactuality, the percentage of SunTrust employees and revenue and client facingjob has been steadily increasing.", "Moving to corporate real estate, the implementation of ourcorporate real estate space utilization strategy, including sale leaseback, isprogressing according to plan. Completed transactions today represent nearlyone quarter of the 2009 run rate improvement bill of a $100 million.", "We've been actively marketing 469 properties over the pastseveral months. Majority of these properties are currently under contract andwe expect to have the remaining properties that are for sale under contract bythe end of the year. Based on current data, it actually looks like all of themwill be under contract within the next several weeks with closings on theremaining sales expected to occur during the fourth quarter of '07 and thefirst quarter of 2008.", "As I previously articulated, it is a crucial part of ourongoing effort to grab shareholder value and we strategically invest to ensurethat we are able to capture market opportunities and to grow the businessovertime.", "So, on page 4 of the presentation deck we've outlined somerecent examples of where we are investing for growth. Our mobile bankingapplication, which we will launch next month is designed to target Gen X andGen Y segments of the population. It will allow users to access account balanceand transaction history via mobile devices and it'll also enable users toconnect to the increasingly popular Bill Pay platform.", "We are also implementing an online payroll application forour highly valued small business clients. It will be integrated with the onlinecash manager product and provide end-to-end payroll functionalities. This willalso launch in November.", "In the mortgage line of business, we continue to capitalizeon the current environments to obtain highly seasoned, top-producing mortgageoriginative to augment our efforts to grow that business and to increase theirmarket share. We added 178 net new real estate mortgage loan officers in 2007,and the net overall sales team increased by over 300.", "Also during 2007, we'll open 47 new branches, improve,renovate or refresh over 50% of our existing branches. Last investments Imentioned today are those related to our GenSpring family offices formerlyknown as AMA. In addition to the recent rebranding, we've also opened a New York office, hiredseveral more client advisors and completed a small acquisition. These examplesare only a subset of the various investments we are making for the futuregrowth of the institution.", "Moving to the capital management side of our shareholdervalue efforts, we've repurchased 10.2 million shares to date in 2007 throughthe combination of an accelerated share repurchase program and open-markettransactions.", "We remain committed to our goal of maintaining a 7.5% Tier 1capital ratio and have an estimated Tier 1 ratio of 7.45% in the third quarter.", "We are also continuing our evaluation of how to optimize ourcapital structure in light of our holdings of Coca-Cola of common stock. I willpoint out the obvious in saying that this evaluation is not about the Coca-ColaCompany. We believe their management team and board are leading the company inthe right direction for the benefit of all shareholders. This is only about theSunTrust Capital structure and uncovering ways to optimize are inherentefficiencies for SunTrust in holding a significant portion of our equity basein a publicly traded stock. As a result, as we've noted, we are going for amethodical approach of evaluating our alternatives, and we expect evaluation tobe complete and to communicate our plans by the end of this year.", "In summary, despite the difficult operating environment thisquarter, we are pleased with the results of our efforts to drive shareholdervalue, and the tangible benefit they are producing. Our focus remains on keycomponents of our plan, while revenues reduce the growth rate of expenses,increase the efficiency of the balance sheet and optimize our capitalstructure, while returning a high rate of our earnings to shareholders.", "I'll look forward to continuing our share -- to share oursuccess on these fronts, as we finish at the current year and move into 2008.", "Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark Chancy. Mark?", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks Jim, and good morning. Given the difficultenvironment that we are operating in, I am going to be providing near-termguidance regarding certain key metrics in my comments, and for your reference,we've included in the appendix a summary of the forward-looking statements thatI plan to make.", "I'll begin the discussion outlining the key drivers of ourthird quarter results, before spending time discussing the credit environmentin some level of detail.", "As Jim noted and as outlined on page 5 of our earningspresentation, we reported net interest margin of 3.18, our third consecutive 8basis point margin increase. Margin improvement was a direct result of thebalance sheet management strategies that we've implemented in connection withour shareholder value initiatives in 2007.", "We would also expect this positive trend in margin tocontinue in the fourth quarter. I'll remind you that we were slightly liabilitysensitive, and as such lower short-term rates and a more steeply sloped yieldcurve creating an environment conducive to maintaining or growing our netinterest margin.", "As we remain focused on maximizing the value of our balancesheet, we will continue to be selective in the businesses and the assets thatwe are likely to grow.", "Average loans for the third quarter of 2007 wereapproximately $120 billion, down 1% from the third quarter of last year. Thedecline was due to the balance sheet management strategies implemented sincethe second quarter of 2006, and which accelerated in the first half of 2007.", "Strategies resulted in the sale of nearly $10 billion inloans over the past year primarily comprise of mortgage, student and corporateloans. Taking into account these loan sales the company actually had underlyingloan growth across most categories, and compared to the second quarter of 2007,average loans were up $1.4 billion or 5% on a sequential annualized basis,primarily driven by commercial loan growth. And with regard to loan growth, onething that you should not expect to see is any meaningful increase in largecorporate loans related to \"hung\" leveraged buyout transactions, asSunTrust does not have any significant exposure in this area.", "Now shifting to deposits. We continue our focus ongenerating low-cost deposit growth despite our client\u2019s increasing preferencefor higher rate products and the highly competitive market for deposits at thistime. Despite a 1% decline in average customer deposits year-over-year, we weresuccessful in reducing total brokered and foreign deposits by over 20% relativeto the third quarter of 2006, thereby reducing our reliance on these highercost earning sources and improving margin.", "We have also recently experienced significant lift in newchecking account acquisitions as a result of our successful My Cause campaign.This promotion will continue in the fourth quarter and we are focused onexpanding our relationships with these new customers through cost sale ofadditional products and services.", "Now moving to the $42 million increase in provision thisquarter relative to last quarter. As you saw this morning, third quarter netcharge-offs were 34 basis points. The year-to-date charge-off ratio is 28 basispoints, which is within the 25 to 30 basis point guidance range that weprovided in July.", "However, we expect net charge-offs to increase somewhat inthe fourth quarter, though at a slower rate of increase than we haveexperienced in recent quarters. To be more specific, looking out over the nextthree quarters, we anticipate charge-offs to fall in the 35 to 45 basis pointrange, assuming there is no material further deterioration in the economy.", "I will be providing an in-depth look at our credit picturemomentarily, though I want to point out here that given the fact that we are ina period of increased uncertainty regarding the direction of the economy,interest rates and residential real estate, we are limiting our guidance oncharge-offs out until mid-2008.", "Ultimately, the level will be highly dependent on thedirection of the currently isolated and industry-wide consumer credit qualityissues, the health of the residential construction market, as well as homeprices. However, I am going to spend a good deal of time dissecting ourportfolios in providing statistics on various components to demonstrate theiroverall health. I will also get very specific on a few areas where we arehaving some problems, and what we are doing to mitigate the associated potentiallosses.", "And one final note before I move on to non-interest income.You will note that our allowance total loans increased this quarter by $43million to 91 basis points. Debt allowance to non-performing loans decreased. Iwant to reiterate that we believe the reserve coverage is adequate given ourcurrent view of losses embedded in our existing loan portfolio, I will providea little more color on this when I discuss the components of the portfolio andour current non-performing loans in a minute.", "Now with regard to non-interest income, as Jim mentionedearlier, we were not immune to the financial impacts of the difficult capitalmarket conditions this quarter.", "The net mark-to-market impacts to our EPS came in at $0.28per share, or a little over $160 million pre-tax during the quarter. Thisnumber is up from our prior disclosure in early September, which as you recall,was based on our actual results through August. And it was up due to additionaldeclines primarily in mortgage related fixed income valuations in September.", "We provided a breakout of the impacts on page six of theearnings presentation for your review. As you can see, the most significantvaluations declines, as noted in the capital markets section of this slide,were related to collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backedsecurities.", "And although these losses are currently largely unrealized,we don't expect material recovery in the short run. The mortgage impact wasrelated to credit-spread widening during July and August where spreads widenedat an unprecedented speed and magnitude. For SunTrust, the spread wideningimpacted mortgages originated for sales through non-agency investors, as agencyproduct is forward sold as part of our normal practice.", "Beginning back in the fourth quarter of 2006, andaccelerating in the third quarter of 2007, we dramatically reduced our exposureto non-agency products. Currently, less than 5% of our originated for salevolume is non-agency, and it is primarily high-quality jumbo product for thatsmall component. While we are disappointed with the mark-to-market loss in thisarea, had we not taken actions to reduce non-agency production beginning lastyear, our mortgage related losses would have been significantly higher.", "The impact that is noted in treasury is primarily related toa net positive mark on the $3.3 billion of publicly issued debt that was movedto fair value earlier in the year. As credit spreads widened for the industryand for SunTrust specifically, this debt position gained value. And as with themajority of the negative marks that were incurred in the quarter, this gain islargely unrealized at this point.", "Capital markets disruption that we and the industryexperienced was unprecedented in terms of speed and size. However, observingthe comparative impact on other firm's capital markets and mortgage businesses,it provides us some comfort in our business mix and risk management business.", "Now moving to expenses, and I am going to focus on theyear-to-date numbers that you can see on the chart. Year-to-date expensesincreased 3.6% over the same period last year. However, there are numerousnon-recurring items that affected the expense base and current year expenses assummarized on page six. Largest of these items is the net non-recurring E2items of $58 million in 2007, of which severance represents $45 million.", "Additionally, the $44.5 million impact noted in '07 isrelated to our election to record certain newly originated mortgage loans heldfor sale at fair value. Under this election, costs associated with theorigination of mortgage loans held for sale are recognized as a component ofcompensation expense when the loan is originated. Prior to the fair valueelection and specifically in the year-to-date period for 2006, these costs weredeferred and recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale of the loan.", "The approximately $11 million reversal of the LILO reserveprimarily relates to truing up some of the reserves that we held against ourleasing program in 2006.", "The next item relates to an accrual reversal associated witha private placement of legacy trust preferred securities. As a result of theearly termination of these securities we recorded a life-to-date adjustment toour accrued liability resulting in a one-time expense reduction of $33.6million in the quarter.", "In connection with our capital optimization initiative, weintend to replace this Tier 1 capital in the fourth quarter with hybrid capitalsecurities that have higher equity content. And lastly, in the same vein the$9.8 million increase in expense is due to the loss on early retirement ofcertain legacy trust preferred securities, which we also intend to re-financein connection with our capital strategy, with higher equity content securitiesin the fourth quarter.", "So the reason we go through this reconciliation process, andafter considering all these various one-time expenses, the bottom line is togive you a view of year-over-year expense growth, which was approximately 1.5%.", "And the growth on a year-over-year basis after making theseadjustments is really focused in one primary area, which relates to themortgage fraud related operating losses and other costs associated with thechanging credit environment. And if you take into account those expenses thatgrew year-over-year, our overall company expense growth was basically flat.", "So needless to say, we are extremely encouraged by theprogress we've been making in our ongoing efforts to enhance productivity andefficiency across the Company and the results of those efforts are producing.", "Let me also note that our effective tax-rate for the quarterwas 27%, which is below our year-to-date rate of 30%. Reduction in rate wasprimarily attributable to the lower level of earnings that we generated in thequarter, due to the mark-to-market losses in the severance related expenses, aswell as, the true-up of expense associated with the early termination of thereferred security, and it was not related to any specific tax event thatoccurred during the quarter. The expected tax rate in the fourth quarter wouldapproximate 30%, resulting in about that level for the full year of 2007.", "I am going to shift gears and talk about SunTrust creditposture. I will begin this discussion with some general comments about our loanportfolio, and then spend time delving into some of the specific products andloan categories within the portfolio.", "As you can see on the page seven of the presentation, ourloan portfolio is a $120.7 billion. It\u2019s well diversified from both a productand a client perspective. From a geographic viewpoint, the loans aredistributed throughout the SunTrust footprint, and we have no material exposureto credit card and/or other consumer unsecured lending.", "The commercial and commercial real estate portfolios, whichcomprise about 40% of the overall portfolio are performing well overall.However, there is an increasing trend of charge-offs in residential mortgageand home equity lines, which collectively represent 38% of the portfolio. So, Iwill spend a few minutes reviewing these in more detail.", "Page eight of the earnings presentation depicts theresidential mortgage product breakout. The largest portion is our core mortgageportfolio, which represents 63% of the overall portfolio. It\u2019s roughly halfprime jumbo and half ARMs originated for the portfolio. And we have said thisbefore, but I want to reiterate, that we do not have a portfolio option ARMs,sub-prime loans or negative amortizing loans. We do have interest-only ARMs,but the interest only period is 10 years unlike many sub-prime loans. As youcan see in the bullets, this is a highly-quality portfolio with a weightedaverage loan-to-value at origination of 73% and current average FICO scores of729.", "As you can see Lot loans,which are made for individuals for developed plots, represent only 5% of theportfolio. FICO score is also very strong at 735. Our Prime 2nd Mortgages,which represent 11% of the residential portfolio are comprised of insuredpurchase money second liens. These are often called combos or piggybacksbecause they are closed at the same time as the first mortgage, and theproceeds are used to purchase the home.", "Now, we also have Alt-A loans of $1.7 billion on a combinedbasis, which comprise 5% of the overall portfolio. $1.1 billion of these arefirst liens and are well secured with a weighted average LTV of 76%. Theremaining $600 million are second lien loans and this portion of the portfoliohas insurance, and we've established a reserve for potential claim denials basedon our experience to date.", "It is important to note that this is basically a decliningportfolio as we began making a series of changes in the underwriting standardsin the fourth quarter of 2006 that ultimately resulted in rationing down ourproduction of Alt-A loans to virtually zero by the end of the third quarter of2007.", "Our next loan category Home Equity loans, comprises 12% ofthe residential portfolio, and it too has healthy statistics with a weightedaverage FICO score of 725, loan-to-value at origination of 71%, and 40% ofthese loans are actually in a first lien position.", "And finally, the 4% of portfolio labeled Wealth andInvestment Management are loans made to high net worth clients in this line ofbusiness. That gives you a detailed overview of our residential mortgageportfolio. And now, I am going to move on to page 9, which depicts the end ofquarter home equity line portfolio approximately $14.6 billion, and you can seethat the weighted average FICO on this portfolio is 734 and 24% of theportfolio is also in a first lien position.", "87% of these loans are originated through what would beconsidered low-risk channels. The most common of which is VAR branches, and toa lesser degree, through our wealth and investment management relationships andfor cross sales to our mortgage customers. The remaining 13% has originatedthrough somewhat higher risk wholesale channel.", "Weighted average seasoning of this portfolio is 27 months.Further, 72% of the portfolio has FICO scores of above 700 and 72% of theportfolio has LTVs of 90% or less. Now the bottom line is that we areexperiencing the most pronounced deterioration in a portion of this portfoliothat has LTVs greater than 90% and current FICO scores that are less than 660.", "You have the data in front of you now, so you can draw yourown conclusions, but ours is that the percentage of this portfolio that posesthe greatest risk of loss to SunTrust is in the single digits.", "Now moving to the construction portfolio on page 10.Construction and acquisition and development for commercial business purposesaccounts for 27% of our total construction portfolio. On the residential side,the quarter represents 38% of total residential related development loans, andthis percentage is inclusive of residential acquisition and development,residential construction, construction perm and raw land. 95% of ourconstruction nonaccruals are from residential related construction, and theyare geographically dispersed throughout the SunTrust footprint. We are well diversifiedby client in residential construction, which we believe is a real positive.", "And as you can see, the loan size, on average, is arelatively small $560,000. So to summarize the point at this slide, a largepiece of the portfolio is currently well performing commercial purposefinancing. On residential, we are well diversified by geography and the numberof borrowers, and finally, we have minimal exposure to raw land.", "I will finish today by talking about our nonaccrual loans onpage 11, which as I am sure, you have noted increased $238 million since June30th. First, let me be clear about this slide. We are focusing on a subset ofNPAs, the non-performing loans in this discussion, because by and large when aloan moves from nonaccrual to OREO, it has been written down to the expectedrealizable value. The second point is that nonaccrual balances represent theloan amount and the expected loss can be far less, which we intend to pointout.", "Two of the most important points on page 11 of the presentationare that the Alt-A portfolio is 50% of nonaccrual loans and that 65% of theseloans are in the first lien position with a weighted average LTV of 76%.Second, we have insurance and reserves established to the Alt-A seconds. Sowhile a 76% loan-to-value insurance and reserves don't eliminate potentialadditional losses, these facts should help you reach a conclusion that therewill be relatively low-loss severity on the Alt-A portion of nonaccrual loans.", "Most of the remaining portion of the residential nonaccrualsare from our core portfolio, which we noted previously has a weighted averageLTV of 73%. So, once again, while there is likely some loss content in thisnon-performance, the lower LTVs will help significantly mitigate the lossseverity.", "95% of construction nonaccruals are from residential relatedconstruction and development, and this is an area that we are watching veryclosely. We have not realized any material losses in the construction portfolioyet, but the weakening in the housing market warrants our attention.", "Now I'll leave the credit discussion by repeating the pointwe believe the severity of losses in residential mortgage NPLs is mitigated bythe loan-to-values and insurance, and noting that our allowance for loan andlease losses covers annualized third quarter 2007 charge-offs by over 260%.", "Our intent with this detailed discussion today was to helpprovide a better understanding of the overall health of our loan portfolio, andwhere we see the isolated issues. We have been, and will continue toaggressively monitor and adjust underwriting guidelines, product mix andpricing as warranted. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the operatorto begin the Q-&-A session of the call. Operator?", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question todayis from Gary Townsend. You may ask your question and please state your companyname.", "Gary Townsend -Friedman, Billings", "Hi, this is Gary Townsend with Friedman, Billings. Good morning Mark and Jim. Markcould you discuss in the home equity portfolio the issues of severity versusfrequency? And, if you could also focus it on, has there been, as we have seenin other companies, a concentration, as I would presume, in correspondentdelivered or wholesale purchase loans?", "Mark Chancy", "We have Tom Freeman, our Chief Credit Risk Officer with usthis morning, so I am going to ask him to address that question.", "Tom Freeman", "I think severity versus frequency was the first part of thequestion, if you look at the charts that were provided, and we are reallytrying to go over a thought process in terms of the home equity loans, is thatwe are actually seeing most of our charge-offs and problems in that portfoliocoming through a relatively small portion of the portfolio, which is the highloan-to-value and the low FICO score portfolio. Now the portfolios weregenerated with our general profile of strong FICO scores, but we did, in fact,have some that we generated loan-to-values in excess of 90%. It is a relativelysmall number of the portfolio, and it is generating a significant amount ofwhere the losses are coming from.", "In terms of channels, most of our channel, if you take alook at this, comes out of primarily bank originated loan activity, but I thinkwe would be disingenuous if we didn't say that those loans generated out of ourwholesale channels where we are buying loans from the marketplace, perform inan inferior manner to our core originated portfolios.", "Gary Townsend -Friedman, Billings", "I am sorry, did I understand you, probably to say that thewholesale originated is performing equally to what you --?", "Tom Freeman", "No. It's performing poor than our core originated portfoliosout of our branches itself.", "Gary Townsend -Friedman, Billings", "Okay. Thank you for comment.", "Eugene Kirby", "This is Eugene Kirby, and we have made a number of changesin our origination. It's around the wholesale segment, significantly increasingour pricing and tightening up on our credit standards. And have basically movedto a pass that, by the end of this quarter heading into the fourth quarter wewill have no loans over 90% LTV coming through the wholesale channel and have asignificant reduction in the overall production in that channel, because it hasperformed at a level that we are not happy with compared to the core bank.", "", "Gary Townsend -Friedman, Billings", "Thank you for your comment.", "Steve Shriner", "Thank you, Gary.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor.You may ask your question, and please state your company name.", "Matthew O'Connor -UBS", "Yes, UBS. Jim, earlier this year, you had said there were nosacred cows, as you look to evaluate the businesses and the balance sheet mixthat you have. Given the macro environments, it\u2019s probably going to be lot moredifficult than we would have thought both for capital markets and credit. Areyou going to take a kind of a double look at some of the businesses andconsider downsizing or exiting some of them?", "Jim Wells", "Yeah, Matt, as you know, I remain in my no-sacred cowsposition, and we are re-looking at the sub-lines of business actively to seewhat is going on there, what the future potential is, and if we see things outof that work that leads us to conclude the risk is not worth the reward we'llcertainly deal with.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. And can you give us a sense of what areas you might belooking at and the timing of when a decision might be made?", "Jim Wells", "I would actually care not to until the work is done, Matt,if you don't mind. You could imagine what they would be based on what's goingon in the market, I think.", "Matthew O'Connor -UBS", "Okay. How about on the timing side?", "Jim Wells", "We are looking at it, we constantly look at the sub-lines ofbusiness and I would expect that some of that are getting a re-look, you willsee some activity in over the next month or two or three.", "Matthew O'Connor -UBS", "Okay. And then, just a question for Mark, obviously, a lotof moving pieces here, care to take an estimate of what run rate earnings mightbe, as we go into 4Q and beyond?", "Mark Chancy", "You know, Matt, I am going to leave that to you and yourcolleagues. We have tried to be very clear about the items that have, you know,affected our earnings. We\u2019ve talked about severance specifically, we\u2019ve talkedabout the mark-to-market adjustments, the early extinguishment of our legacytrust preferred securities as part of our capital optimization strategy of acouple of cents. We also were very explicit about the benefits that we receivedin connection with the termination of the REIT related transaction. So, I'llleave that to you\u2019ll discretion in terms of determining the run rate.", "Matthew O'Connor -UBS", "Okay. And then, just lastly, I am sorry, I missed it, but interms of provisions versus charge-offs going forward, would you expect, can youbuild to the extent that we saw this quarter?", "Mark Chancy", "No. Like we, in terms of the valuation of the allowance, wefeel comfortable based on the data that we have, and our current loan portfoliothat the allowance adequately stated. It will depend on a variety of factors;it will depend on loan growth, the type of growth that we get in the loan book,whether or not we have improvement or deterioration in the existing portfolios,what the level of charge-offs are. So, there are a lot of factors that go intothe determination of what the provision will be in a given period, as you know,and I won't speculate on how all those different variables are going to reflectin the next quarter's results.", "Matthew O'Connor -UBS", "Okay. But just in general assuming your charge-offs fallingin that 35 to 45 basis point range for the next few quarters?", "Mark Chancy", "You know Matt, if you assume all of being equal that loanscontinue to grow, then by default, you will expect some level of increase inthe provision relative to charge-offs. How about that?", "Matthew O'Connor -UBS", "Okay.", "Mark Chancy", "Thank you for your questions.", "Matthew O'Connor -UBS", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac.You may ask your question, and please state your company name.", "Christopher Marinac -Fig Partners", "Hi, Fig Partners in Atlanta.This question is for, if I guess, for Mark, but also for Jim as well. You areall aware that there is some practice in the industry of building interestreserves for construction loans and also making loan modification as thingschange. To what extent is SunTrust doing that or what is your policy ascustomers go through changes?", "Tom Freeman", "Perhaps, it\u2019s Tom Freeman again, and maybe I will wait inhere and I have Walt Mercer with me who runs our commercial real estatebusiness here at the bank. Our policy is, of course, as you know that interestreserves are in fact an inherent part of what we are doing, doing constructionactivity, because one can't be in construction activity without making surethere are adequate interest reserves. We re-evaluate our construction loans ona rolling ongoing basis. We evaluate monthly, whether or not the interestreserves are appropriate, and are more than willing to press for incrementalreserves, if in fact we think that they are required.", "We have a very rigorous review process, and we also have thesupport of, I think, some very good systems in knowing the construction progress,the progress of sales activity under the individual loans, and therefore, kindof, what do we need, and in terms of interest reserves to the sell-out periods.I will also speak to the fundamental underwriting, which is pretty downrigorous in terms of with whom we do business, making sure that they havesubstantial liquidity, and are they sorts of borrowers, who during difficultperiods can afford to extend and ride through difficult periods within themarkets. So, yes, we do have interest reserves, yes they are rigorouslyapplied, and yes we look at them constantly.", "Christopher Marinac -Fig Partners", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful, Tom, and just a follow-up. Arethere any markets on the construction side where you are not taking newconstruction customers on the commercial construction?", "Tom Freeman", "Maybe Walt will answer that for us.", "Walt Mercer", "Hi. Well, we look across the whole footprint sort ofcustomers, there are a number of areas especially in residential real estate.We were looking carefully at the portfolios, especially in South Florida right now, and given the housing market there, we are notpicking on a lot of new construction.", "Christopher Marinac -Fig Partners", "Okay. But will South Floridabe the only example or are there others?", "Walt Mercer", "I think that's a primary example right now, we are lookingat the whole portfolio very rigorously, monthly, given the current economicenvironment.", "Christopher Marinac -Fig Partners ", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin St. Pierre.You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein", "SanfordBernstein. Good morning. The loan-to-value ratios, average loan-to-value ratioswhich you have given us on a few of the portfolios are at origination. Ipresume, you have done some analysis to estimate what current loan-to-valuesmight be, I was wondering if you could perhaps share some of that with us?", "Tom Freeman", "We have an ongoing evaluation process upon renewal or in anyof the lending activity, where we believe that there is any sort of restrictionin value, and as anyone who can read the literature knows that we have hadshrinkage in value. We have seen shrinkage in value most aggressive in South Florida. We have seen minor shrinkage in value interms of single-family housing prices, pretty much across the portfolio. Butyou got to remember that in some of these instances we get amortization on theportfolios. We have extensions and repayments on the commercial side and we dokeep a very clear set of rebalancing initiatives during the renewal periods orre-negotiation periods in any of the lot.", "Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein", "Yeah, but can you share with us any stats on whatloan-to-value might be on the core mortgage portfolio based on what you expecttheir current values?", "Tom Freeman", "The answer is no. I mean, we are keeping at it. We have seensome increase in the loan-to-value since the origination, which you got toremember that parts of the portfolio are in the average life of the portfolioapproaches 3 years, which means that large parts of the portfolio are 5 yearsor 6 years old and older and wherefrom the initial origination actively towhere it is now. We still see shrinking loan-to-values in terms of some of thatstuff given the progress of loans through the loan lifecycle.", "Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Tom Freeman", "We\u2019ve offsetting characteristics here.", "Kevin St. Pierre - Sanford Bernstein", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Mike Holton, you may ask your question and pleasestate your company name.", "Mike Holton - MerrillLynch Strategic Investment Group", "Merrill Lynch Strategic Investment Group. I appreciate theadditional disclosure on the construction portfolio, and my question there is,given the NPAs, I guess, about doubled from June to September, Mark, you eludedto them probably going higher in the future, can you guys kind of provide arange on how much of an increase we might see there, maybe over the next two tothree quarters?", "Mark Chancy", "We are really not going to get into forecasting the rangesrelated to NPAs and NPLs, I guess, our point in the detailed discussion was toknow where the NPLs are coming from, what the characteristics of thoseportfolios are, so that you can get a better understanding of potential lossseverity, and, of course, find out both to the charge-off levels, as well as,the adequacy of the reserve. Now that's probably as far as we want to go interms of providing you with forward-looking information. We have said beforethat we would expect some keeping of the NPAs, particularly related to ourAlt-A portfolio is probably going to be a little bit later than we had hoped,which was in the third and fourth quarter, it will probably be in early 2008.Now that's our current expectation, but that's probably the only incrementaldata point that I am going to provide you. ", "Mike Holton - MerrillLynch Strategic Investment Group", "Okay. Let me ask one, I guess, backward looking question,and of the $158 million in construction NPAs, how much of that is raw land?", "Mark Chancy", "I am sorry, could you repeat your question?", "Mike Holton - MerrillLynch Strategic Investment Group", "Right. You had a $158 million in construction NPAs in thequarter and within the construction portfolio you pointed out that there isabout $1 billion of raw land?", "Mark Chancy", "Correct.", "Mike Holton - MerrillLynch Strategic Investment Group", "How much is on NPA status?", "Mark Chancy", "It's a de minimus amount.", "Mike Holton - MerrillLynch Strategic Investment Group", "Okay, thanks.", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks.

You mayask your question and please state your company name.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Hi, it's Banc of America Securities. You gave some helpfulstab at what the charge-offs might do in the first half of '08. You mentionedmargins in the fourth quarter and early '08 today? Sorry, if I missed it, didyou give any quantification mark of how much the margin could benefit in thefourth quarter and into the first half of '08?", "Steve Shriner", "Yes John, this is Steve. We expect the margin trend that yousee on page 5 of the presentation to continue into the fourth quarter, and havenot provided any additional guidance beyond that for a quarter period.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay, meaning that you are kind of up 8 basis point, andquarter-to-quarter you could have a similar jump in the fourth quarter?", "Mark Chancy", "Yeah, we're just commenting that the trend that you haveseen, you can see here over the last three quarters\u2026", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay.", "Mark Chancy", "It is likely to continue on a positive note.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay.", "Mark Chancy", "But we are not going to get into the specifics of what thattarget should be for the quarter.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay. And is this some continued pull through of the balancesheet positioning, and as a function of the fact that -- has the curve rate andyield curves done a little better?", "Mark Chancy", "Yeah, that's exactly right.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay. And in '08, you are saying, we should get some benefitthere, you are saying also in '08 this trend should continue?", "Mark Chancy", "Well, that would depend on interest rates and the slow bookto curve and a variety of other factors. In the short run, we see continuedimprovement. Beyond that, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell, and also it would bedependent upon loan growth, deposit growth and other factors.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Sure. Okay, that's fair. And then just a quick question ifyou could, could you just kind of give us a little flavor for theconsiderations that are applied as you think through the Coke decision?Obviously, you get something through it, but what are the factors there that,you know, will drive your decision, and if you do end up selling some of theCoke stock, would you likely have to replace it with some other form ofcapital. Well, early in the year when you sold your Coke stock, you couldbuyback SunTrust shares, does the equation become a little different goingforward?", "Jim Wells", "Sure, John, that evaluation does continue. We obviously havea capital that is in our tangible equity-to-assets. It's in our total capital,but it\u2019s not in our Tier 1 capital, based on the regulatory framework. So,considerations include our long-term Tier 1 target, our relationships and thecapital level relative to the rest of our businesses as it's evaluated by therating agencies. Opening up a decision process around structure of our holdingswill be predicated on an evaluation of how that Coke in its current form oralternative form, fits into our long-term capital strategy and it\u2019s evaluatedbetween regulatory, our safety and soundness review, as well as, the ratingagencies.", "And, we plan to be completed with that review by the end ofthe year. We obviously have a significant embedded gain in the Coke Holdings,that\u2019s a consideration. So, it\u2019s around the optimization of our capitalstructure as we have set our target. One of the things we are clearly doing isevaluating the Tier 1 target in the context of how we might manage the Coke stockgoing forward. So, it\u2019s a variety of factors that are at play here, and it'sobviously a complicated set of issues, and we are going to come back andexplain to you where we are at some point later in the quarter.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay. One quick follow-up there, Mark did you mentionanything outside of that about if you are in a position, you kind of be doingbuybacks in the fourth quarter?", "Mark Chancy", "Yeah, John we are right at our Tier 1 capital target at 745versus the 750, obviously the decision process around the Coke holdings, aswell as, the growth in Tier 1 capital during the quarter will dictate whetheror not we have incremental flexibility. And so we will be evaluating thatthroughout the quarter. I wouldn\u2019t expect a significant share repurchase in thefourth quarter, again aside from any Coke related decisions, although theremaybe some modest repurchases based on the growth of the balance sheet and ourearnings.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay.", "Mark Chancy", "Given the level of repurchase that we\u2019ve had, through theyear-to-date period, we anticipate that we\u2019ll meet the guidance that weprovided earlier in the year in terms of return of capital to shareholders,both through a combination of dividends and share repurchase.", "John McDonald - Bancof AmericaSecurities", "Okay.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Shriner, Director of Investor Relations.", "Steve Shriner", "Good morning, welcome to SunTrust\u2019s First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation that covers the focus of our call today, an update of capital our efficiency and productivity program, a broad risk and credit overview and a review of financial results. Press release, presentation, and detailed financial schedules are available on our website www.SunTrust.com. Information can be accessed directly today by using the quick link on the SunTrust.com homepage entitled First Quarter Earnings Release, or by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. ", "With me today, among members of our executive management team are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk and Credit Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter, including an update on capital and our efficiency and productivity initiatives. Tom will them provide a detailed review of our risk and credit picture and Mark will conclude the call with an overview of financial topics, including impacts to earnings this quarter. We will then open the session for questions. ", "First, I\u2019ll remind you our comments today may include forward looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We\u2019ll list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website. Further, we do not intend to update any forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date forward looking statements are made and we disclaim any responsibility to do so. ", "We\u2019ve detailed the forward looking statements made in conjunction with today\u2019s earnings release in the appendix of our first quarter earnings presentation. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website. Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Jim. ", "Jim Wells", "Good morning everyone I\u2019m glad you\u2019re with us this morning. As anticipated, SunTrust and the industry continue to face a very challenging earnings environment in the first quarter. Growth and provision expense associated with residential real estate correction took a toll on results. However, SunTrust remains a financially strong institution with significant growth opportunities. With that point we are encouraged by underlying progress in key business lines this quarter, good deposit and even saw modest loan growth, and the positive impact of improved discipline.", "Indeed non-interest income was up double digits this quarter and expenses remain flat compared to last year. However, overall earnings for the first quarter of $284 million or $0.81 per common share were largely impacted by the growth and provision expense associated with the housing correction. Provision expense was $560 million for the quarter which covered $297 million in charge offs and provided $263 million to increase the allowance for loan losses to 125 basis points.", "We obviously are not pleased with our credit performance and the impact on near term earnings. However, as you will hear we are and have been working on the right things to minimize risks in new production and to mitigate losses in the existing portfolio. Tom Freeman is going to cover credit in great detail but I do want to point out that the elevated credit metrics are primarily confined to the consumer portfolio particularly the residential real estate secured categories.", "Within these categories the majority of the risk that is coming from relatively small segments that are largely run off portfolios and I expect this risk will run its course. However, the commercial real estate, commercial, and commercial purpose construction categories continue to perform relatively well overall during this quarter. Home values and consumer credit have obviously deteriorated over the last two quarters particularly and while the Blue Chip forecast on the economy is zero GDP growth in the first half of 2008 there appears to be more down side risks to this view than there is up side possibility.", "While I believe the Federal Reserve is being quite responsive to the difficult environment it does appear to me that the economy is going to be weak in the short term and this weakness could possibly extend into 2009. While we all certainly hope for one of the better economic scenarios to unfold we are prepared for the alternative. SunTrust remains financial strong, ample liquidity and with adequate capital in the solid balance sheet.", "Turning to slide three I\u2019ll spend a couple of minutes outlining our capital and liquidity position. Our estimated tier one ratio is 7.25% up from 6.93% last quarter. Our February trust issuance was $685 million replaced $600 million of capital securities that were redeemed during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 and moved us back in the right direction relative to a 7.5% tier one target. As we indicated at year end we expect the transactions involving our Coca-Cola equity holdings to be complete in the second quarter.", "While this may be obvious to most of you, by virtue of the fact that we are sharing this strategy with external parties you can surmise that the preferred approach does not reflect a simple outright sale of this stock. I\u2019d also like to remind you that our view and actions are 100% about SunTrust and our capital efficiency as we believe Coke is performing well and will continue to do so. Under just about any scenario we anticipate a minimum tier one capital increase of approximately $1 billion which would add roughly 65 basis points to the tier one ratio on a pro forma basis.", "The additional 65 basis points would take us well above our current target and as such we anticipate reassessing the appropriateness of our long term target of 7.5% in a post transaction environment. Unless we consider a little excess capital a good thing in the short run until the future economic and credit environments become clearer.", "We significantly enhanced liquidity position over the past year. For example, brokered and foreign deposits have been decreased by almost $11 billion or 42% as a result of our balance sheet restructuring initiatives. The result of these actions is that we are operating with a solid capital foundation of strong liquidity. Increasingly important positions to maintain during these uncertain times.", "I\u2019ll spend a few minutes updating you on our E\u00b2 efficiency and productivity initiatives before turning it over to Tom. On slide four I\u2019m very pleased with the results of our efficiency initiatives and the manner in which our entire team is contributing to create this success. We exceeded our expanded and expedited 2007 goals by nearly 20%. Further, with a clearer view of our 2008 and 2009 potential I\u2019m happy to report that we expect to achieve run rate savings of $500 million in 2008 an increase of $150 million over our prior goal.", "We are also increasing our overall program goal to $600 million run rate savings during 2009. This represents a $275 million or an 85% increase in 2009 savings from our original expectation communicated in early 2007. Moreover the $600 million 2009 goal represents over 11% of our 2006 non-interest expense base a significant accomplishment. I do want to emphasize that this program and the higher expected run rate in 2008 is not a short term reaction to the current environment. ", "Instead it relates to greater success in preexisting initiatives where the work is substantially complete. As a reminder we began our review in 2006 and are steadily progressing with initiatives that were thoughtfully conceived and carefully executed. A good example is the outsourcing agreement with Symcor that we announced just this last week. This arrangement for example will allow us to lower our costs and to increase our investment focus while providing best in class products and services to our clients.", "I believe that what we are experiencing is a true transformation of the culture of the organization relative to expense discipline. Our efficiency and productivity focus is taking hold. This is important because we expect this discipline to help enable restrained expense growth and greater operating leverage on the other side of the current credit and economic cycle. As we\u2019ve articulated previously the success now and in the future is also important in creating additional capacity to invest in the franchise particularly in high growth business opportunity.", "Moving to slide five I\u2019ll now spend a moment outlining the impact this initiative had on the first quarter results. First quarter run rate savings were $113 million an increase of $38 million or 51% from the fourth quarter of 2007. As Mark will enumerate shortly the savings we\u2019ve been able to generate as a result of this program are contributing meaningfully to our goal of realizing lower expense growth rates. The biggest driver of the increased savings this quarter was related to our organizational design initiative in which 2,400 positions were targeted for elimination by the end of 2008, 1,900 positions were eliminated during the fourth quarter of 2007 resulting in a full fourth quarter impact.", "However, it is important to note that only a third of the total increase from the fourth quarter run rate was from position elimination. We are also gaining traction in each of the other four work strengths; corporate real estate, supplier management, outsourcing, and process reengineering. We have a little more work to complete in the corporate real estate and organizational design initiative but the bulk of the growth in savings from here will be generated by supplier management, outsourcing and process reengineering.", "The benefits to the process reengineering initiatives are two fold. Technology enables middle and back office efficiencies also helped to realize our vision of being easier to do business with both internally and externally. Economic uncertainty notwithstanding we remain confident in our execution of our strategies and the growth potential within our existing businesses and market. Though it\u2019s still unclear as to how long this environment will persist as I said before I know that the banking industry will weather the storm and that SunTrust will retain its legacy of safety and soundness. ", "Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Tom Freeman to talk about risk posture at Credit Data.", "Tom Freeman", "This morning I\u2019m going to provide a brief review of our securities portfolio and then spend time going over the credit data. I\u2019ll be referring to our presentation slides beginning on slide six. As you know, the credit securities market showed high volatility around a downward trend during the first quarter. Mortgage securities continued their downward trend which started last year. As you can see on the graphs the pressure on mortgage valuation spreads to other asset classes during the quarter.", "Corporate credit spread has widened significantly through mid March and then rebounded somewhat in response to the Federal Reserve\u2019s continued efforts to add liquidity to the system. Overall for the quarter the decline in prices resulted in the net trading losses we reported this morning. You should also note that we have no un-syndicated exposure to the large syndicated leverage loan market which caused write downs across the industry during the first quarter.", "Slide seven shows the progress we have made in reducing the carrying value of the securities we acquired from our asset management subsidiary and three pillars, our commercial paper conduit for client transactions. Carrying value of these acquired securities has been reduced by almost 60%. In addition to these portfolios below the subtotal we\u2019ve included the AAA portion of the securities we retained from the securitization of almost all our purchased commercial loan securities.", "Exposure on all the securities has been reduced by almost $1.9 billion, $750 million in write downs including roughly $240 million in the current quarter. In addition, we sold over $500 million of these securities at or near carrying values. Over $600 million in repayments were also received. We continue to evaluate performance of the assets underlying each security as well as market liquidity and pricing. We are actively selling when market pricing is reasonable as compared to our view of intrinsic value. We believe we are carrying these securities at appropriate values, however the markets remain volatile and further valuation adjustments up or down are possible.", "Slide eight in the presentation depicts our available for sale portfolio at March 31. It does not include the unrealized gain on our Coke shares or other equity securities, primarily our Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan bank stock. This portfolio consists of 91% AAA securities, 76% of the portfolio is government agency and US Treasury securities. The duration of the portfolio is relatively short at 4.3 years. As of March 31 the net unrealized gain is $172 million. ", "As Mark will point out later we did recognize a $64 million other than temporary impairment charge during the quarter. This charge arose from our normal impairment review of securities. The total charge of $64 million is related to securities with a mix of home equity and mortgage loan collateral. The remaining carrying value of these securities after the charge is approximately $200 million. Our overall AFS portfolio today is $9.6 billion smaller than it was at the end of 2006, as a result of our balance sheet restructuring.", "During the second quarter of 2007 securities sales included just under $4 billion of commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, private mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds. Overall, we maintain a high quality liquid portfolio and in retrospect are pleased with the timing of the second quarter 2007 sales.", "Turning to credit and slide nine of the presentation. I\u2019m going to get right to the point. Credit metrics deteriorated in the quarter. Charge offs were 97 basis points annualized while non-performing assets increased to $2.3 billion. Residential real estate continues to be the biggest driver of charge offs and NPAs. Based on our review of the losses embedded in the portfolio we raised the allowance by $263 million to 125 basis point of loans.", "On a more positive note we did experience a flattening out of early stage delinquencies as the overall 89 day delinquency rate declined by one basis point as compared to year end. Additionally, we have implemented a number of changes that have successfully minimized new risk coming into the portfolios and are working very hard to mitigate losses in the existing portfolio. We are not pleased with the risk and performance in certain portfolio segments. We expect that charge offs will remain elevated at near current levels until the second half of the year. Deterioration has slowed and we believe ultimate losses will be manageable within our current capital, liquidity and earnings framework. ", "Turning to slide 10 and the Loan Portfolio. Why do we think overall losses are manageable? Commercial portions of the portfolio $37 billion is performing well. Our retail and commercial real estate books are also performing satisfactorily. Our core residential mortgage portfolio is performing well with better performance than the comparable mortgage banker\u2019s association index for prime lines. Its important to remember that we originated no sub-prime or option ARM for our residential portfolios. Our home equity loan portfolio is also performing well.", "Current problems are brokerage home equity lines, Alt-A mortgages and the construction of earned portfolio, all of which have been isolated and are in a run off mode. The problem assets are concentrated in residential real estate secured loans. At 180 days past due we write these loans down to realizable current values, as a result we recognized the majority of our credit losses in the non-performing one which we will discuss in a moment.", "Our loss severities where we have take charge offs are within expected ranges by product given the original loan to values. If you turn to slide 11 I\u2019ll begin a more detailed review of the residential mortgage, home equity and construction portfolios. The residential mortgage portfolio represents 27 of our total portfolio and contributed 52% of the total non-performing loans. Core residential portfolio of $22 billion is performing well showing better than average delinquency and charge off characteristics.", "Delinquencies throughout the residential book are improving with early stage delinquencies leading the way. The exception of Alt-A 2nd is driven as much by a shrinking portfolio down 10% since last quarter as it is by delinquencies. In fact, we have seen improving 30 to 59 day delinquencies for five successive months on the Alt-A book. Lot Loan portfolio is showing stress but remains relatively small portfolio. Ninety four percent of the residential mortgage portfolio shows a decrease in 60 day plus delinquencies.", "We view this as a leading indicator of potentially lower future NPLs and subsequent charge offs. Over 80% of the portfolio has original loan to value ratios below 80% and as a result will show smaller loss content than higher LTV portfolio segments.", "The next slide is designed to walk you through our losses within the residential portfolio. Thirty one percent of our net losses during the past 12 months have come from residential mortgages. We have already recorded a charge off using current market values on 60% of our residential mortgage non-performing loans. As a consumer residential loan moves through the delinquency tiers we stop accruing interest between 90 and 120 days past due. Charge off is typically not recognized until 180 days past due.", "Prior to charge off we obtain a current property valuation and a market assessment. One hundred 180 days past due we record a charge off to reduce the balance to a level likely to be realized through the foreclosure process as prescribed the IEC. Generally a loan is written down to approximately 85% of current market value. Within any portfolio of residential mortgage NPLs it\u2019s important to understand both the relative age of the NPLs and potential loss severity. That is what slide 12 shows you.", "We have a carrying value of $648 million on 60% of our quarter end NPL balance. That has already been written down by $215 million. We have not yet taken the 180 day write down on 40% or $384 million of the NPLs. The loss severity percentage listed in the final column is the actual average write down incurred to date on the portfolio segments. We have not calculated the portfolio average for you because we believe it would be materially misleading since Alt-A 2nd drove over half the write downs at a loss severity of 81%. We also list Prime 2nd as NA because this is an insured portfolio. The other loss severities are reasonable.", "For example, the Alt-A 1st portfolio showed an original LTV of 77% on the previous slide. The severity is shown at 11% on this slide. If the loans are written down by 11% had average or original loan to values of 77% like the portfolio it means that the loan is being currently valued at 31% less than the appraised value at closing. The last discussion item related to this slide may well be the most important. At quarter end we will have $384 million of NPLs which have not been written down. If you apply our prior loss severity against the remaining NPLs a write down of approximately $70 million would result.", "We recognize that home and lot values are expected to decline further and severity may increase. However, the real point is that $70 million losses on over $1 billion of NPLs is manageable. Even if severity increased 50% a loss of around $105 million is still manageable on our mortgage portfolio. To summarize, the data we provided on the residential mortgage portfolio should suggest to you that losses here will be manageable. If you are optimistic that the US economy will avoid a deeper recession you might conclude that the bulk of the losses in this portfolio will be behind us after the next quarter in June.", "Moving on to slide 13 and the home equity line of credit portfolio. This slide is similar to the one provided last quarter and frankly the message is much the same. Third Party Originated home equity lines continue to perform poorly. Fortunately they are only 12% of the HELOC portfolio and 1.5% of our total loan book. We identified the performance issues for this segment early 2007 and began tightening credit standards at that time.", "Overall performance issues are still contained to roughly one third of the HELOC portfolio. The point of the segmentation is while current credit scores are holding up well across the board it is apparent that the origination channel and higher original LTVs are key drivers of performance. If roughly $5.7 billion in outstandings in the portfolio segments showing the most deterioration. We expect this portfolio to continue to produce significant charge offs for at least the next few quarters at 30 plus delinquency has picked up since December and as home values remain soft.", "There are some mitigating factors which suggest charge offs could stabilize. Reductions in the prime rate are materially lowering payments. Approximately two thirds of the portfolio continues to perform well and while I noted that 30 plus delinquency picked up from December the rate of increase has slowed. ", "The last of the portfolios under stress is construction loans which is displayed on slide 14. The $13 billion construction book is declining meaningfully down roughly $800 million since December to 10% of the total loan portfolio. Construction to permanent loans are loans to individuals to build single family homes. These loans are transferred to permanent mortgage financing once construction is complete. This portfolio has not performed well but is rapidly declining. Exposure has decreased 26% to $4.1 billion versus a year ago.", "Outstanding are down from a peak of $3.7 billion to $3 billion today. We expect the portfolio to rapidly decline over the next year. Charge offs in the book should peak in the next three to six months and decline after that as the portfolio runs off. Residential construction loans which are loans made to commercial home builders will continue to show increasing problems in our softer markets. Commercial construction book continues to perform well.", "I\u2019m going to move on to slide 15 then wrap up. This slide is a list of loss mitigation actions for your reference. I\u2019m not going to cover the content, we\u2019ll summarize by saying that we have been aggressively reducing the risk profile of new credit reduction and are laser focused on having the right people processes, systems and procedures in place to mitigate the risk we already have.", "I\u2019ll make a few comments in summary to wrap this up and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to cover financial results. We had a bad quarter for credit, currently the problem areas of our portfolio remain contained to 13% of our books. These areas, many in run off mode are degrading our credit metrics. We believe some of these problem areas will resolve more quickly than the overall cycle and further believe we are seeing early signed to that effect. ", "As we look at our current NPLs and delinquency queues and recognizing that our foresight is constrained by economic uncertainty we expect charge offs to increase in the second quarter by 15% to 20% from the $300 million recorded in the first quarter. We expect the economy to soften and home values to decline further. With that in mind we also expect that some additional reserve building will be required. However, after increasing the reserve ratio by a combined 34 basis points in the last two quarters including 20 basis points in the first quarter we expect the future quarterly increases will moderate.", "On a longer term view it is nearly impossible at this point in the cycle to predict the future with any confidence. However, as we look at the portfolio trends and potential future scenarios we believe we should experience lower charge offs in the second half of the year if the economy and home prices don\u2019t deteriorate too far and fast from here. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to review our financial performance.", "Mark Chancy", "I\u2019ll start with a few highlights in what was generally a good quarter for both loan and deposit growth. Overall loan growth picked up in the first quarter, the sequential annualized growth rate was 5% we are effectively back to even with last years loan balance. The reason this is significant is that as you may recall we transferred $4 billion in mortgages to held for sale in the first quarter of \u201907. We subsequently sold them as part of our balance sheet restructuring initiative.", "Commercial loan growth which began to pick up during the fourth quarter continued that trend this quarter. The largest contributor to the $1.5 billion or 4% sequential quarter growth was the energy sector in our wholesale segment. Leasing and the technology sector also experienced good growth this quarter. Equally notable is the $800 million decline in construction as a result of existing projects being completed coupled with dwindling demand and a low appetite on our part for new projects.", "While less material to the balance sheet overall our de-emphasis of the indirect auto lending product is apparent in the annual and sequential quarter decline as well. The deterioration in the economy and pressure on the consumer this deliberate reduction is appropriate in our view. Deposits are also showing improved growth and mix strengths. The majority of the growth is occurring in interest bearing now and money market accounts.", "The significant decline in high cost broker and foreign deposits as compared to last year was also the result of our balance sheet restructuring initiatives which significantly enhanced the company\u2019s liquidity position. It\u2019s probably not obvious from the average balance data are the very recent trends in deposit mix. You look at the period end balance for the deposit included in the press release table you will note that balances are up a similar $1.5 billion however instead of declining versus last quarter DDA is actually up $1.2 billion and money market balances are also up while consumer CDs and NOW accounts are down.", "DDA balances have remained through early April and while we know that some of the DDA growth is temporary and related to anticipated tax payments it appears that we are seeing the early signs of a cyclical shift in commercial client balances out of sweep accounts and into DDA. Now I\u2019ll spend a few minutes on margins on slide 17.", "Margin increased five basis points relative to the first quarter of 2007. However, net interest income decreased 2% primarily as a result of reduction in our securities balance. Fourth to first quarter margin compression was widely expected and we experienced six basis points of margin compression bringing our net interest margin to 3.07% in the first quarter. While we are hopeful deposit mix will stabilize or perhaps even improve in 2008 we expect additional pressure on margin next quarter.", "Realization of the full impact of the first quarter Fed rate reductions continuing deposit pricing competition, growing NPAs and the potential for additional Fed cuts all point to further margin compression in the second quarter. As for the second half of 2008 we currently believe margin will stabilize and possibly expand if deposit pricing pressures in volumes improve despite the continuing potential for rising NPAs.", "We continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce lower margin and lower risk adjusted return assets such as student and indirect auto lending in favor of higher profit prospects as risk adjusted spread in commercial and small business are more attractive. Further, we are also continuing our aggressive efforts to attract and retain consumer and commercial deposits with investment in deposit centric advertising and promotions targeted specifically to business clients and prospects.", "Now moving to provision expense on slide 18, Tom provided a detailed review of the credit so I will just point out that we have been building reserves steadily and consistently in light of current and expected charge offs. Total provision expense for the quarter of $560 million includes charge offs equal to an annualized 97 basis points from loans plus $263 million or 20 basis points added to the allowance. ", "Moving to non-interest income on slide 19. Non-interest income grew 20% on a reported basis versus last year and 13% adjusted for net gains in both years. This validates the solid revenue generating performance in most of our lines of business. We achieved double digit reported increases in things like service charges, retail investor sales, investment banking income and card fees. After adjustments for valuation write downs core client trading revenue and mortgage production income also increased significantly.", "In order to adjust the reported growth rate for certain unusual items realized in the quarter a reconciliation of adjustments is included in the appendix for your reference. I\u2019ll spend a few minutes outlining the major items now. During the quarter we realized a gain from the Visa IPO of $86 million, a gain of $89 million on the sale of our remaining 25% interest in our hedge fund business Lighthouse partner. ", "A gain on the sale and lease back of corporate owned branches and office buildings of $37 million. An $18 million increase in the time acceleration of the recognition of mortgage servicing value and the net impact of market valuation write downs was approximately $100 million and this includes $240 million in net write ups on the value of debt related hedges which partially offset the write downs. Lastly, we incurred $64 million in securities losses available for sale securities due to the classification of approximately $264 million of residential real estate collateralized securities as other than temporarily impaired.", "In summary, there were a lot of unusual items in the quarter but the underlying fee income growth is in the double digits as compared to last year if you exclude all of these items. We are very pleased with that type of performance during the course of this quarter. As Jim discussed we are also very pleased with the results of our E\u00b2 initiative as you can see on slide 20 results of our efforts are becoming increasingly more visible.", "Our reported expenses grew 1.5% versus last year and were down 14% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. After adjusting for a few non-core items primarily Visa litigation accruals, PHAS 91 and asset dispositions expenses were flat compared to last year and down 2% versus last quarter. We are particularly pleased with these results for two primary reasons. First, year over year expense it would have decreased by over $36 million or 3% if not for expense increases directly attributable to the change in the credit environment.", "Second, adjusted expenses are down versus last quarter in spite of the normal seasonal increase in benefits primarily employer paid social security which represented $35 million this quarter. I\u2019ll make one last point regarding expenses. We are continuing to invest in the business in ways that create long term value for our shareholders. A visible example is the 20% plus increase in marketing and customer development dollars spent in each of the last two quarters as compared with the respective prior year quarters.", "There are several investment examples to point to; I\u2019m calling this one out because the increase spending level is directly supporting the successful acquisition of consumer and commercial client\u2019s deposits and therefore long term revenue SunTrust. I\u2019ll conclude the formal comment of the call with a summary of the key initiatives and performance drivers discussed in today\u2019s presentation on slide 21.", "First, we are increasing capital moreover we are currently operating with a solid capital foundation and strong liquidity. We are raising our overall E\u00b2 program goal to $600 million and the run rate savings during 2009 and this represents a savings of over 11% of our 2006 non-interest expense base. We are aggressively managing our securities exposure. Furthermore we are minimizing new credit risk while mitigating our existing risk.", "Finally, and perhaps most importantly we are encouraged by the underlying progress in key business lines. We are particularly pleased with our ability to grow deposits this quarter and prudently increase loans. We are executing these actions against a backdrop of a manageable level of margin pressure, solid non-interest income trends and strong expense management results. With that, let\u2019s open the call for some questions. Operator we are now ready to begin the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Brian Foran you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk a little bit about the dividend payout ratio that you are comfortable with in the short term and longer term just given where earnings are right now? Would you be comfortable with a near 100% payout ratio or at some point does that become a risk even with the potential capital gains from Coke?", "Mark Chancy", "We went through some significant evaluation as you would expect at the end of the year related to our dividend in making the decision to increase it approximately 5% year over year. We did sensitivity analysis on our earnings both in the short term as well as on longer term basis and felt comfortable with that increase. The payout ratio will ultimately be a function of the actual earnings level for the full year for the company but as I mentioned earlier and we\u2019ve stated a couple of times we feel very good about the overall capital position of the company with a 7.25% tier one capital ratio, the prospects of completing our Coke related transaction during the second quarter that would add 65 basis points or more of capital.", "The fact that our current liquidity position and our ability to grow capital on a net basis over the next several quarters so an approximate 8% or so pro forma capital at the end of the second quarter is something that we are comfortable with and feel like as we look out over the next several quarters that both dividend payout ratio and dividend yield will be at acceptable levels.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "If I could follow up on a separate topic. You mentioned early delinquencies are stabilizing but a number of your competitors have noted that the problem is really roll rates and the later stage delinquency buckets as well as rising severities. Could you just put your comment about potentially being at or near the peak in loss rates in the context of roll rates and severity and what you are seeing there?", "Tom Freeman", "Good question, what we are seeing is that the early stage delinquencies are coming down which are really going to impact a quarter to two quarters out what we think the later stage delinquencies and roll rates are going to provide for. Current late stage delinquencies have in fact picked up somewhat and we expect them to given the previous quarters increase in early stage delinquencies. In terms of severity we saw an increase in severity particularly in the third party originated home equity lines over the last quarter.", "Those severities have gotten very large and don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got much room upward in terms of the severity levels. We think within those individual business segments the severities have gotten about as high as they can get and then in addition we believe that the early stage roll rates will begin to mitigate flows into non performers in charge offs in the later quarters of this year.", "Mark Chancy", "I forgot to mention one thing. I think the tangible equity to asset ratio of 6.5% that we currently have is also a distinguishing feature as you compare us to other peers during the course of the quarter and as you look out over the next several quarters. In addition to the regulatory capital position that we are in we feel good about our overall tangible equity base.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s actually a pretty good point. The last thing if I could is just the debt write ups you\u2019ve had over the past two quarters of $325 million if your spreads tightened does that come back through the P&L or how should we think about that going forward?", "Mark Chancy", "We have benefited and had an offset as a result of the widening of credit spread that has offset a portion of the net negative effect on the trading asset that we own. We will be working through a partial hedging related strategy to mitigate the net loss that will be ensued over the course of the next eight to nine years as those spreads come back and tighten and the debt matures. The answer to your question is yes, over the course of time those gains will normalize as the bonds mature.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "Could you quantify the decline in interest margin you expect in 2Q and then also the upside opportunity in the back half of the year assuming we are mostly done with the Fed cuts?", "Mark Chancy", "We anticipated some marginal decline in the margin during the first quarter which we realized six basis points quarter over quarter. We are continuing to see in the marketplace active deposit pricing as people want to maintain liquidity both on a customer and a wholesale basis. I will say that we\u2019ve seen some normalization if you will of the rate betas on the various interest bearing deposit products in recent weeks over the past month timeframe.", "While the historical relationship that mean rates paid and changes in libor have not held in the last quarter and that had put some pressure on our net interest margin. We are seeing some normalization of pricing in the marketplace to reflect the lower short term interest rate that the Federal Reserve is obviously been moving the market towards. I think that is a key element for us an also our ability to grow low cost deposits as we mentioned in the presentation our period end balances and the balance mix improved.", "We have gotten growth on a year over year basis 3.5% we have a tremendous number of initiatives focused on growing our net new checking household. We have spent a significant amount as you can see in the numbers on our marketing and advertising and the growth in core customers through our My Cause campaign which has been very successful. We are focused on growing those household and those lower cost deposits and that will be a key determinant along with this rates paid scenario as to whether or not margins stabilizes in the short run and then improves.", "Obviously the steeper yield curve in general is a benefit to us but we also have to get the relationship between the earning asset yield change and the liability costs to normalize somewhat before we can feel good about projecting growth in the margin.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 UBS", "Its sounds like you would hope just a modest decline in Q2 if I understood correctly?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Mayo you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The E\u00b2 initiative you have $113 million this quarter and you look for $500 million for the year. Should we expect only a little bit more incremental phase quarter to quarter?", "Jim Wells", "Yes. I think that\u2019s accurate. We are working on the longer term value aspects of our program at this point. Many of the shorter term ones have born fruit and will be what they are. We are increasing the 2009 number as well.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Back to credit quality. You said the problems are mostly confined to residential mortgage, home equity, and construction as you mentioned but the other 87% of the portfolio, how do you feel about that? We are hearing from some other banks that increased concerns with small business and maybe even certain areas in the commercial portfolio.", "Tom Freeman", "In the other 87% of the portfolio the portfolio looks stable. Of the areas where we are watching it very carefully and really are intervening aggressively is we are concerned about our residential construction specifically within Southern Florida and are spending a lot of time and attention trying to get those situations stabilized. As you look at deterioration in the core portfolios they continue to perform pretty well. The CNI looks very good some softening in our lower end small business product but nothing dramatic. ", "I think as you really take a look at it, we don\u2019t have what a lot of the other guys have got which is lots of unsecured consumer debt out there which is where I think a lot of the deterioration is beginning to take place. The commercial portfolios are holding up very well.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Last question, this is a hard question. What impact does what\u2019s going on with libor have on you guys or how you even think about some parties that you deal with?", "Mark Chancy", "As you can see with the relationship change that libor has had it was above Fed funds for a period of time it them moved down below Fed funds as the Federal Reserve was moving short term interest rates down and then in recent weeks its moved back up sharply. Our overall sensitivity position we are liability sensitive and so as rates decline and the curves steepens in general that benefits us and so as I mentioned they key to that relationship is not only the effect that higher libor has on earning asset yields but also the relationship of the various interest bearing deposits to whichever metric you want to reference.", "If you want to think about it relative to libor, the swap curve or Fed funds. The key to our margin stability and increase over the course of the year will be affected by that libor Fed funds relationship will be more affected by the lower cost deposit growth that we realized and the manner in which deposits are priced relative to those various metrics.", "Operator", "Betsy Graseck you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the reserve bank could you give us some indication as to how you are factoring in home price changes? I\u2019m wondering if your reserving analysis takes into consideration home price values at present time or some future expectation for home prices.", "Jim Wells", "We do a segment by segment review. The segments reviews factor in a view basically based on a Case-Shiller indexes for housing prices. We review what\u2019s moving in housing prices and adjust our severity expectations around charge offs for the individual product segments which really captures the movement in housing prices. We make, in addition to the quantitative adjustments, which would have a tendency to lag we make qualitative adjustments in expectation of movement of the housing prices.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Are you factoring in the forward expectation in case Shiller forwards or are you mostly using just point in time data?", "Jim Wells", "We analyze the point in time data in order to determine what we think the current loss expectations are within the portfolio and then we make qualitative adjustments based upon the future movement expectations in the Case-Shiller indexes.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Could you just give us a sense of what your forward look at this stage for the portfolio?", "Jim Wells", "I believe that especially the Florida markets are showing some continued downward movement in the markets specifically in Southern Florida. The rest of the markets are showing slight downward trends. The Atlanta marketplace and the Georgia marketplace is stable to slightly down. Mid-Atlantic markets are stable to a little more down in the marketplace. Basically our Carolina markets are relatively stable at the moment.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the Coke question, I know that you\u2019ve been thinking about different alternatives including an outright sale and the regulators are planning on some of the proposals that you have. I\u2019m wondering when do you decide not to wait for the regulators any more and do what you can do which is execute a sale and recognize that gain to bring that into your tier one number?", "Mark Chancy", "As Jim mentioned you can surmise from the evaluation that we\u2019ve been going through now for several quarters that our targeted transactions do not include just a simple sale of the stock to generate the tier one capital out of the holdings that we have. We are not in a posture where we need to immediately convert the stock to capital. We have a strong base capital position, we have a strong liquidity position, our tangible equity asset ratio is in very good shape so we are going to finish out the process that we entered into back several quarters ago and we expect that that will be complete during the second quarter.", "I just say stay tuned we\u2019ve given you a fair amount of information as to what we expect the result to be if we are able to bring the proposed transactions to fruition to your point we always have that alternative options but we are focused on finishing up here in the second quarter and we\u2019ll give you a full overview of the transactions at that time.", "Jim Wells", "Just to add to that I think it\u2019s important to understand that we are trying to find the best reasonable transaction for our shareholders, that\u2019s who really matters in all of this. Given our capital position we have been searching and we hope we have found transactions that will accrete better to shareholders than a simple sale might.", "Mark Chancy", "As you know, Coke continues to perform very well given their earnings release last week or so their dividend increased and so we are not going to accelerate the process just to meet an arbitrary timeline. We\u2019re going to try to complete a transaction as Jim mentioned are in the best interest of our shareholders and we anticipate doing that here in the second quarter.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "That makes sense, I\u2019m just thinking that since you initiated the transaction, announced it to the investing public, credit quality has been deteriorating not only at SunTrust but in the industry. The bar has been raised with regard to what tier one needs to be in this environment or asset durations or extending and credit deteriorating. I\u2019m just wondering what degree of urgency do you feel with regard to not only the Coke holding but capital structure in general.", "Jim Wells", "Fortunately we are in a position where we can be careful and caring about this to the benefit of everybody. That\u2019s the way we are approaching it.", "Operator", "You next question is from Jefferson Harralson and it will be our final question you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "I have a couple questions for Tom. If you guys break out the Florida exposures that a lot of the banks we\u2019ve seen this quarter have had or even Georgia NPAs especially on their residential construction portfolios can you talk about how Georgia is holding up maybe even versus Florida in your residential construction and maybe your HELOC portfolios?", "Tom Freeman", "I think the Florida portfolio is where we saw the early incurrence of our problem portfolios. We really started about a year and a half ago to take a look at our residential construction portfolios and have managed those down aggressively over the past year and a half. That exposure is down about $1.7 billion and outstandings are down $500 to $550 million over that period of time. We watch our inventory levels with all of the builders very carefully.", "What we\u2019ve seen is some softening specifically in lower home prices in the Georgia region but where we lend most of our money is in the custom home marketplace, that\u2019s holding up relatively well. In Florida, however we\u2019ve seen a deterioration in housing prices less and less inventory going into the marketplace and we\u2019ve been working through that stuff fairly aggressively so we\u2019ve seen some deterioration in the lower end of the Georgia market I guess is the best way I can answer that for you.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "In the delinquency the improving delinquencies in the home equity book in the first quarter what part does seasonality play in it? Isn\u2019t first quarter a better seasonal quarter there and we should expect that to maybe increase since we have had home prices decline expected to continue to decline. Why do you think that improvement is going to last throughout the year if you think that?", "Tom Freeman", "The home equity book is one of the three problems we talked about earlier. It is the one we think is going to continue to have problems through the remainder of the year. Early state delinquencies while they flatten didn\u2019t radically improve in the home equity book during the first quarter; they improved a lot in the other two problem portfolios. Typically the first quarter sees some seasonality adjustment but it\u2019s not a big seasonality improvement quarter for us and in fact the second quarter would show seasonality improvement more aggressively than would the first quarter.", "We are not enthusiastically optimistic about what\u2019s going to go on in the home equity market. We think its going to be a pretty long haul over the next year to really if we move through the HELOC specifically. Our home equity loan portfolio is older and more mature and performing really well. It really is the brokered loans where we are really having the majority of our problems. That a little over $1.8 billion, as you look at that portfolio its going to continue to cause problems over the next two or three quarters.", "Jim Wells", "With that, thank you very much for joining the call today.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference thank you for participating you may disconnect at this time.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NYSE:STI) Q2 2008 Earnings Call July 22, 2008  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "", "Steve Shriner - Director, IR", "Jim Wells - CEO", "Mark Chancy - CFO", "Tom Freeman - Chief Risk and Credit Officer", "Eugene Kirby - Retail Lines of Business", "Analysts", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets", "Operator", "Welcome to the SunTrust Second Quarter Earnings Call. All participants have been placed on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Shriner, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Steve Shriner", "Good morning. Welcome to SunTrust's second quarter 2008 Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to focus on during our call today.", "Slide 2 outlines the content, which includes an update on our regulatory capital and specific information on our completed Coke transaction, a review of our financial results, including an update on E-squared initiative, and an indepth credit overview.", "Press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available in our website www.suntrust.com. Information can be accessed directly today by using the quick link on the homepage entitled \u201cSecond Quarter Earnings Release\u201d or by going to the Investor Relation section of the website.", "With me today, among other members of our Executive Management team are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk and Credit Officer.", "Jim will start the call with an overview of today's highlights. Mark will then detail financial performance and Tom will conclude with an indepth review of our risk and credit picture. At the conclusion of the formal remarks, we will open the session for questions.", "First I will remind you, our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date forward-looking statements are made, and we disclaim any responsibility to do so.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking ability about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jim.", "Jim Wells", "Good morning, everyone. Glad you're with us this morning. There are few items that I would like to review with you that are captured on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. I will begin with a topic that I know is top of mind for everyone on the call, capital.", "At SunTrust, our Tier 1 capital level improved substantially as a result of the completion of the Coca-Cola stock transactions during the second quarter and in July. Tier 1 capital came in at an estimated 7.47% up 24 basis points from March 31.", "Portion of the Coca-Cola stock transactions were completed in July after our June 30th quarter end. If you apply the full benefit of the Coca-Cola stock transactions in aggregate, the resulting pro forma Tier 1 ratio was approximately 7.95%. Based on what we see today, we believe this position us appropriately for the future.", "Mark will provide greater detail on each of the three Coke transactions including their financial impact momentarily.", "Now moving on to another topic of considerable interest; credit. Our overall asset quality continued to deteriorate during the second quarter. Net charge-offs increased 9% from the first quarter of 2008 $323 million, and non-performing assets increased approximately 800 million or 35%. There were, however, some slightly more positive notes. Early stage delinquencies have remained stable in the 1.5% range for the last six months, and the additional provision expense required to increase the reserve declined by half.", "So, overall the credit message is mixed. Increased charge-offs and non-performing assets on one hand, point to higher losses of the short run. On the other hand, stable early stage delinquency and slower growth in reserve may suggest and result in a pace of deterioration that is slowing.", "In the very short run, charge-offs will grow and Tom Freeman is going to provide more detail later in the call. Visibility into the fourth quarter and beyond is limited. This is particularly true for non-real estate based consumer and commercial credit quality, as the outcome is fundamentally a macroeconomic question, and the outlook for 2009 is quite uncertain at this point.", "Based on what we know today, we believe the actions we have taken to manage risk, increase the reserve, bolster capital, and to improve core earnings will be sufficient to see us through the better times.", "Moving on to core earnings, specifically revenue as expected in the current market, core revenue generation was little soft. The softness was most apparent as volume decreased and affected mortgage revenues.", "However, there were a number of positives this quarter including a six basis point increase in the net interest margins, driven by deposit pricing changes and a shift in mix to lower cost categories.", "Steady growth also continued in a number of fee-related categories including service charges on deposits and card-related fees. On the expense side, we continue to tightly manage our core expenses.", "Growth over last year is in the low single digits after adjusting for non-core items despite credit related non- interest expenses more than doubling. Given the solid capital position and progress on core earnings I've just outlined, I'd like to reiterate that we do not anticipate modifying our current dividend at this time.", "While we recognized that the pay out is currently high relative to both our earnings and the long term goal of returning 60-80% of earnings to shareholders, we view the current earnings pressure is of shorter term and our dividend policy is longer term in nature.", "Of course, we will monitor all of these subjects closely but that's our intention based on what we know today.", "Before turning it over to Mark, I'll conclude by saying that we are acutely aware of the environment in which we're operating, and the uncertainty surrounding our industry and the economy.", "The operating environment certainly continues to be challenging and that being said, we remain committed to our existing business strategies and dedicated to executing initiatives related to deposits, to expenses and to managing risk.", "Our associates remain intensely focused on serving our clients and growing their business. Their efforts are driving tangible results that are positioning SunTrust for improved financial performance on the other side of this cycle. Now, let's turn it over to Mark. Mark?", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks, Jim. I'll begin my comments today starting on slide four of the earnings presentation. I'm very pleased to report that we completed certain transactions related to our holdings of common stock of the Coca-Cola Company, and we received approval from the Federal Reserve to treat one of those transactions as Tier 1 capital.", "As a result, our Tier 1 capital ratio as of June 30th is estimated to be 7.47%, and including the benefit as Jim mentioned of these transactions that were completed in July, our pro forma June 30th Tier 1 ratio is 7.95%.", "These transactions reflect the completion of a thorough review of our longstanding Coke holdings, and they accomplish the goals and objectives that we set out at the outside of this outset of this process. I'll review each aspect of the transactions in detail in a moment.", "Given the uncertain outlook for macroeconomic conditions in general, and credit quality in particular, we believe maintaining a Tier 1 ratio in excess of our previously stated target of 7.5% is certainly prudent.", "In addition, we have approximately $500 million of capacity to issue additional Tier 1 qualified perpetual preferred securities, and if the capital markets improve, we may take the opportunity to further improve our capital position. I want to be very clear on this point.", "Given our current pro forma Tier 1 capital level of approximately 8%, our outlook does not suggest we need additional capital; however, uncertainty around the future environment suggest that a little additional regulatory capital on a cost effective basis would be a positive.", "In addition to the strong Tier 1 capital position, our other capital ratios remained very healthy at the end of the quarter. Specifically, our total capital ratio was 10.97%, and tangible equity to tangible assets was 6.21%, when you look at the numbers on a pro forma basis.", "Now, unrelated to the slide in the presentation, the topical in today's environment is our current liquidity position. As a result of the balance sheet restructuring in the first half of 2007, which resulted in a de-leveraging of our balance sheet by approximately $9 billion, SunTrust entered the market turmoil in the second half of last year in a very strong liquidity position.", "That position continues at quarter end at both the bank and the holding company. In fact, year-over-year, short-term brokered and foreign deposits were down $8.9 billion or 37%.", "Typically, on total assets of nearly $180 billion, we are borrowing only $6 billion to $8 billion overnight from wholesale sources. We have $9.9 billion of excess collateral at the home loan bank, $14.7 billion of collateral pledged at the federal discount window, and $8.1 billion of free investment securities. As a result, we are currently very comfortable with our liquidity position.", "Now, moving on to slide five and the details of the Coke transaction that I know that you're interested in. Subsequent to our second quarter 2007 sale of 4.5 million shares, approximately 43.6 million shares of Coke remain.", "We now have completed three separate and distinct transactions encompassing all of these shares. At a high level, the three transactions consisted of the out right sale of 10 million shares, a Tier 1 transaction involving 30 million shares, and the contribution of the remaining 3.6 million shares to a SunTrust charitable foundation.", "Transactions were split in this manner to accomplish a number of objectives, including regulatory capital formation, tax efficiency, expense efficiency, and the retention of both dividend income and Coke stock price appreciation potential on the majority of the shares.", "Sale of 10 million shares generated an after-tax gain of $345 million, an incremental Tier 1 capital of 20 basis points that is included in our estimated Tier 1 ratio at the end of the quarter. This transaction maximized the current period capital contribution of the shares, but was the least tax efficient as it created a current tax liability.", "The Tier 1 transaction involving 30 million shares provided $1.2 billion in cash, and $728 million in Tier 1 capital or an incremental estimated 44 basis points. This transaction was completed in July, and better enhances shareholder value versus an out right sale due to the deferral of taxes, price appreciation potential and dividend retention. I'll cover this transaction in more detail on the next slide.", "Charitable contribution of 3.6 million shares will provide a net income benefit in the third quarter of approximately $69 million or $.20 per share through the release of the entire deferred tax liability associated with these shares.", "This transaction is clearly the most tax efficient of the three, and additional benefits include a small capital impact via the increase in earnings, and our future ability to maintain community support while reducing the income statement impact of our ongoing charitable contributions by roughly $10 million annually.", "So, now let's move on to slide 6 and I'll give you a little bit more detail on the Tier 1 transaction.", "This is roughly a seven year duration transaction providing $728 million in Tier 1 capital as I mentioned, and $1.2 billion in cash. Appreciation potential on the 30 million shares and retention of tax favored dividends over the life of the transaction.", "Tier 1 capital is generated in the following way: The floor price of the shares is approximately $39 million, and this price times 30 million shares equals to $1.2 billion and unrestricted cash proceeds that SunTrust received in exchange for a note issued by us to the transaction counterparty.", "Federal Reserve has reviewed and ultimately granted us permission to include the after-tax value of the $1.2 billion floor value as Tier 1 capital. This amount is the $728 million that I have referenced, and the 44 basis points of Tier 1 capital.", "The transaction also includes derivative contracts, which create the approximately $39 per share floor price I just mentioned, and an approximately $66 per share ceiling price.", "During the life of the transaction, SunTrust will continue to classify the shares as available for sale, and will account for the derivative contracts as cash flow hedges. The net change in value of both the derivatives and the 30 million Coke shares will generally flow through other comprehensive income or OCI on a quarterly basis.", "While the derivatives have been created to hedge the value of the Coke shares and thus mitigate the net change in value that will flow through OCI, we do expect some hedge in effectiveness.", "This transaction will conclude in approximately seven years. At that time, the derivatives will unwind. In connection with the settlement of the Ford agreement, SunTrust may deliver shares at a value between the floor and the cap.", "The gain and associated tax liability will be recognized upon the ultimate disposition of the shares, and we expect that all of the shares will ultimately be sold.", "Now there are many benefits to this transaction, while we could have generated some incremental capital from an out right sale, we carefully considered the benefits of price appreciation, tax deferral and tax-favored dividend income, and concluded that they significantly out weigh the small amount of additional capital that could have been generated today.", "While this is a little complicated, hopefully the information contained on these slides will provide sufficient clarity in conjunction with a slide included in the appendix, which details the balance sheet and income statement impacts.", "Now I'm going to move on to slide 7, where I'll begin our discussion of the second quarter financial results. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $1.53. This quarter\u2019s results as you can see were impacted by a number of core as well as non-core items that I'll address in subsequent slides, but at a high level, let me give you a summary.", "Net interest income is down slightly versus prior periods, but up a little over 1% versus last quarter as net interest margin increased. Provision for loan losses remain cyclically high driven by residential real estate related charge-offs, and the need to build loan loss reserves; however, provision decline as compared to the first quarter as charge-offs increased less than we expected, and slowing deterioration in the portfolio necessitated a lower level of reserve building.", "Non-interest income was positively impacted by the sale of 10 million Coke shares, which is partially offset by $103 million write-down on our fair value debt and related hedges.", "Non-interest expense was negatively impacted by net non-core items as well as credit related expenses, and I'll give you details on that in just a minute. Overall, core operating income remain soft due to elevated charge-offs, reserve building, lower core mortgage-related revenue and higher credit-related expenses.", "So, with that as an overview, I'll briefly cover the key components of the income statement, starting with net interest margin on slide 8.", "Net interest margin reversed trend and increased six basis points over the first quarter. This result is better than our expectations a few months ago, but it is consistent with some of the early signs that I noted during the first quarter earnings call related to the improving deposit mix and deposit pricing.", "During the second quarter, we were able to reduce deposit rates while maintaining our competitive positioning. Additionally, non-interest bearing average deposits reversed trend and increased over 3% versus the first quarter and while some of this was related to anticipated tax payments; June average demand deposit balances remain roughly inline with the average for the quarter.", "Average loan growth compared to the first quarter excluding non-accruals was roughly 1% or 4% on an annualized basis. The source of the growth continues to be primarily commercial relationships, and this growth is offsetting the continued declines in construction and indirect auto that we also noted last quarter.", "Given the results I just noted, we currently expect loan and deposit trends to offset growing NPAs in support of a stable, slightly expanded margin during the second half of 2008.", "Now let me move on to slide 9, and I will briefly touch on provision expense as Tom Freeman will cover credit in detail in a few minutes.", "Total provision expense for the quarter of $448 million includes charge-offs equal to an annualized 104 basis points of loans, plus $125 million or 10 basis points added to the reserve.", "This resulted in provision expense declining by $112 million as compared to the first quarter. As expected and communicated during our first quarter earnings call, slowing growth and charge-offs and stable overall delinquencies required a lower level of reserve building than in the prior two quarters.", "You will note that the overall allowance for loan and lease losses increased to 1.46% of loans as the inclusion of GB&T, the acquisition that we recently completed also added $159 million to the reserve.", "Now on to slide 10, where I will provide some commentary on non-interest income. Non-interest income growth of 22% versus last year is largely driven by the gain on sale of the Coke stock in both periods, partially offset during the current quarter by a write-down of SunTrust debt carried at fair value.", "Excluding non-core items results in year-over-year growth of about 1%. And as expected, lower mortgage banking related income during the quarter combined with private equity gains, and an MSR sale in the second quarter of last year produced a net result on a year-over-year basis that masks steady performance in many fee categories.", "For example, service charges on deposits and card fees showed particularly good growth, while other categories showed steady results. The reconciliation of adjustments is included in the appendix for your reference, and I have already commented on the Coke sale gain, so I will only provide additional detail on three items impacting the current quarter.", "The most significant is the $103 million write-down of our fair market value debt and related hedges. Our debt spreads tightened during April and we disclosed a potential $130 million impact in our first quarter 10-Q.", "This result didn't change much during May; however the markets deteriorated during June as spreads widened and the write-down was reduced to the $103 million level that we are now reporting.", "Second item of note is the approximately $30 million gain from the closing of a previously disclosed sale of First Mercantile, a retirement plan services subsidiary acquired with National Commerce.", "The only other item of note is approximately $12 million in Coke derivative related costs recorded in our trading income account. While not as robust in aggregate regarding fee growth that we reported last the quarter, which was up about 13% on an adjusted basis. We are not surprised or disappointed with our overall core non-interest income growth for the quarter or for the year-to-date period.", "And mow moving to slide 11, which shows our progress in substantially eliminating our risk associated with the securities that we acquired during the fourth quarter of 2007, from our RidgeWorth Money Management and Three Pillars commercial financing subsidiaries.", "I'm very pleased to report that during the second quarter, we reduced our exposure to these high risk securities by over 50%, bringing our overall exposure to under $800 million. While this exposure is down by almost 80% since we acquired the securities, we are specifically happy to report that we disposed of over $800 million of assets during the second quarter, while recording no further write-downs.", "In fact, we actually recorded a small net gain after selling over $600 million in securities and receiving over $200 million in payments. We expect progress slow regarding further reductions in our exposure, but our experience during the second quarter reinforces our belief that we have appropriately written these assets down to realizable market values. And while further losses are possible, we believe that the worst is clearly behind us relative to these securities.", "Now on a related note, we have received a number of inquiries about our exposure to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The answer to that question is that we have no holdings of equity or preferred securities, and only roughly $10 million in senior debt. We do have approximately $10 billion of highly rated mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddy, which are primarily classified as available for sale.", "Now moving to slide 12 and non-interest expense. We remain very pleased with the results of our E-squared initiative. Although it's pretty hard to see the impact given our reported results of 10% growth, so I want to make sure to take a minute to provide as much clarity as I can here.", "The list of non-core items this quarter is relatively short. We recorded a $45 million charge related to a customer intangible valued in 2004 in connection with an acquisition. The overall business is performing well; however the intangible write-down relates to clients present at the time of the acquisition, who are no longer customers. The other significant item relates to the elimination in the second quarter of 2007 of the FAS 91 expense deferrals related to mortgage production costs.", "But if you exclude these non-core items that are detailed in the appendix, our core expense growth was roughly 3% both year-over-year and sequential quarter. While 3% growth in core expense is not a bad result, it\u2019s much higher than it would have been as the cyclically high cost of credit are masking the fundamental progress we've achieved in creating an organization that is sustainably more efficient.", "As noted on the slide, expenses would have decreased by $30 million if not for the change in the credit environment. This would equate to an expense decline of over 2%.", "A one item we have included in credit costs this quarter warrants some additional discussion. We recorded a $25 million expense increased the insurance reserve of our mortgage reinsurance subsidiary, Twin Rivers.", "Our current expectation is that mortgage defaults will continue at current or perhaps higher levels, and additional reserve increases will be required in the future. While difficult to predict for any certainty at this time, our current view is that the probable range of reserve increases during the second half of 2008 is $25 million to $50 million quarterly; however, we believe our total exposure over time is less than $200 million and the ultimate amount, and timing of recognition is uncertain.", "The non-interest expense is associated with the credit environment are clearly core expenses; however the point is that these cyclically high expenses will recede as the cycle turns, and we will be well positioned to produce positive operating leverage and earnings on the other side of the cycle.", "Now turning to slide 13, I will conclude with a few comments on our efficiency and productivity initiatives.", "E-squared savings for the second quarter were $135 million, up from $113 million in the first quarter. This level of savings annualizes to more than our 2008 goal of $500 million. Now rest assured that even though we are confident we will meet or exceed our 2008 goal, we continue to look for every opportunity to increase efficiency and savings.", "We are committed to producing ongoing and sustainable savings that will result in a more efficient organization, and one that is easier to do business with both internally and externally.", "With that let me turn it over to Tom to discuss our credit perspective. Tom?", "Tom Freeman", "Thank, Mark. This morning, I am going to provide a detailed review of our credit situation, beginning with an overview of total portfolio metrics on slide 14 of the presentation.", "The overall pace of deterioration in the portfolio slowed in the second quarter; however, trends differed among products and I will provide details on each in subsequent slides.", "Period end loan balances increased on a sequential quarter basis with over half the growth due to the GB&T acquisition, and the remainder primarily from C&I loan relationships.", "Charge-offs increased 9% to 104 basis points annualized, while actual charge-offs were below the 15% to 20% outlook we provided in April, which was largely due to timing. Looking ahead we expect the third quarter charge-off rate will increase by 15% to 20% over second quarter charge-offs.", "Overall, combined charge-offs for the second and third quarters are consistent with our expectations at the end of the first quarter. Further, nothing we see today suggests that charge-offs will increase or decrease dramatically in fourth quarter versus the second and third quarter levels.", "Provision expense declined in the quarter to $448 million from $560 million in the first quarter. The loan loss reserve increased to 146 basis points on total loans due to $125 million net addition to reserves, and the inclusion of GB&T reserves in our reserve position.", "Our reserve expectation for the third quarter is a modest increase from the current levels given the slowed deterioration in our credit statistics. Non-performing assets increased $816 million during the quarter, to $3.1 billion.", "Excluding GB&T\u2019s NPAs of $170 million, the increase of this quarter of $647 million was slightly less than last quarters $665 million increase. We noted the flattening of the trend in early stage delinquency in the first quarter presentation.", "This pattern continued into the second quarter, and the overall portfolio's 30 to 89 day delinquency rate has now been basically flat for six months. However, it is still early in the cycle we were seeing differing trends among the portfolios with some deteriorating and some showing signs of improvement.", "Next I will provide an overview of product performance on slide 15. The commercial and consumer portfolios comprised 52% of our loan book, and are performing well overall. Commercial portfolio continues to perform appropriately.", "You should also note that we have no material exposure funded or unfunded, syndicated leverage lending transactions awaiting distribution. Within the commercial portfolio, it was a $5 billion small business segment. Second quarter annualized charge-offs in this segment were respectable 1.8%.", "Product category commercial real estate is our non-residential commercial real estate book. It includes both owner occupied and income producing collateral with roughly two-thirds being owner occupied properties. Performance in this is pool is holding up nicely.", "Consumer portfolio, which includes direct, indirect, and a small credit type portfolio is also performing reasonably well given the current environment. Charge-offs moderated in these portfolios during the second quarter, but our expectation is this portfolio will continue to show slightly higher charge-offs in the third quarter.", "If you turn to slide 16 in deck, I will provide you with a view of non-accrual loan composition and trends.", "As you can see from the bar charts, residential mortgages which include home equity lines and loans, more than half of total non-accrual loan balances of $2.6 billion. Our residential non-accruals of over $1.3 billion are significant this potential losses to be recognized it is important.", "We have written down most of these loans to current market value less disposition cost. While mortgage non-accruals have been increasing over the past two quarters, construction non-accruals have also risen, and currently total over $700 million.", "We have specific reserve on a loan-by-loan basis for the majority of the construction non-accruals. I will talk about our loss mitigation activity in the construction book a little later.", "The last point to make on this slide is the GB&T acquisition added $170 million to the non-accruals this quarter.", "Please turn to slide 17 for discussion of the real estate books. Delinquencies overall were up modestly. For Alt-A, the high risk portion of our residential mortgages, balances declined, and credit performance ratios improved, which is notable given the shrinking denominator in the calculations.", "Balances are declining on each sub-portfolio except the core, which is primarily composed of prime loans. Decline is most notable in the home equity loan portfolio. This declined 17% versus last quarter due to repayments on lower production.", "Combined Alt-A balances declined by 6% in the quarter, while combined non-accruals are relatively stable and delinquency rates declined.", "Delinquency for the core portfolio increased by 13 basis points; however, the overall performance of this book remains good with the portfolio continuing to perform favorably compared to external indices for prime ARM portfolios.", "The last thing I would like to point out is what's not on the slide. There are no sub-prime loans. There are no option ARMs or other negative amortizing loan products in our portfolio.", "Next, I will update you on losses recognized and loss severity in the mortgage portfolio on slide 18.", "Our non-accrual balances are up versus last quarter, a portion of the balances that have been written down to realizable market value has risen to approximately 75% of non-performers, up from the 64% we recorded last quarter.", "This is important to remember when evaluating the commonly used allowance NPL ratio. In our case, 75% of our mortgage non-accruals have been through the review and write-down process.", "As a reminder, we write-down based upon updated collateral valuations at 180 days past due for consumer loans, insured by residential real estate as required by the FFIEC rules.", "Only loans, which are well secured relative to realizable value or have private mortgage insurance do not require a write-down. The 180 days we recorded charge-off to reduce the balance to level expected, can we realized through the foreclosure process as prescribed by FFIEC.", "Generally the write-down approximates 85% of current estimated disposition value as compared to the loan balance. Loss severities are also illustrated on this slide by subset, and they remain at levels consistent with our expectations, given original LTVs and declining market prices for real estate. Loss severities have increased versus last quarter, but not meaningfully.", "The last point on this slide is, if there are $284 million in loan balances of non-accruals not yet reviewed for possible write-down. This will be the primary pool of mortgages, which will have write-downs during the third quarter, and they shrunk meaningful from the $380 million balance reported last quarter.", "Summarize, the residential mortgage portfolio discussion today, the portfolio experienced an uptick in delinquency, troublesome Alt-A portfolio performance appears to be stabilizing, and we have appropriately written-down majority of our mortgage NPLs.", "Moving to slide 19 in the home equity line of credit portfolio. Home equity lines of credit non-accruals and charge-offs continued at elevated levels in the second quarter. However, we did experience a moderation in charge-offs. We expect the third quarter charge-off level to be similar to the level in the first quarter.", "While we continue to enhance our collections and default management processes, and have increased staffing levels. We expect home equity lines to continue to show elevated charge-off levels, through the end of the year and into 2009.", "We have also implemented line reduction programs throughout our home equity portfolio, where appropriate. You will note that portfolio balances have increased quarter-over-quarter. I want to specifically point out that the growth is in our lowest risk segment, and primarily results from expected line utilization and lines originated in the 2007 vintage, under substantially more conservative underwriting guidelines.", "The last portfolio I am going to cover today is construction, which begins on slide 20. We previously cited the construction portfolio is an area of increasing risk and focused risk mitigation activities. We have worked on these portfolios starting in 2006. Our actions have resulted in declining exposures and outstandings. Nonetheless, charge-offs and NPLs have increased.", "Overall, construction balances excluding GB&T declined by 6.5% versus last quarter declines of 17% in Construction-to-Perm and 19% in raw land are particularly notable. Commercial purpose construction portfolio represents roughly one-third of the total construction portfolio, and is performing very well.", "On the next slide, I will focus on the higher risk Construction-to-Perm and residential construction loans, as we have been aggressively managing our risk and exposure to these subsets of the overall portfolio.", "Slide 21 highlights a significantly reduced level of risk resulting from aggressively managing our construction exposure.", "The Construction-to-Perm line availability, the difference between outstanding loan balances and total commitments is down 60% as compared to last June. Our savings were down 30% over the same time period. 20% of current outstanding balances have been originated since September of 2007 under significantly more restrictive underwriting guidelines. It\u2019s a troublesome portions of this portfolio are down 78% in availability and 45% in outstanding over the past year.", "Further, we expect the Construction-to-Perm balances to continue to decline rapidly as many of the remaining loans mature during the third and fourth quarters, and clients will be moved into permanent financing products.", "In residential construction, availability of credit has been reduced by 35% for construction and 50% for acquisition and development over the last 12 months. Outstanding balances are down 25% and 13% respectively over the same timeframe.", "Importantly, over 60% of these reductions have occurred in the Florida and Atlanta markets. These portfolios have been and continue to be subject to intensive relationship and project level credit reviews to identify weakening relationships and to establish client-by-client strategies to reduce risk to SunTrust.", "Slide 22 contains a brief summary of key takeaways from today's credit discussion. Asset quality continues to weaken, although at a slower pace overall. The commercial real estate and consumer portfolios continue to perform well.", "Credit issues remain largely confined to the residential real estate segments of the portfolio, and we continue to aggressively manage this risk. Over half of our non-accruals are residential mortgages, and all the 25% of those have been reviewed and written down to realizable current market values as appropriate.", "We expect increasing NPLs and charge-offs in the construction portfolio through at least early 2009. We are pleased with the progress we have made in reducing our overall exposure during last year.", "We expect total charge-offs to increase by 15% to 20% in the third quarter over the second quarter. There is a less visibility in the fourth quarter; however at this point, we don't see anything that suggests charge-offs be dramatically higher or lower in the fourth quarter.", "Finally, we expect that our reserve level will continue to build modestly in the third quarter.", "With that, I will turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Shriner", "Thanks, Tom. We have covered a lot today, so before we take some questions I would like to quickly summarize key messages from the presentation that are included on slide 23.", "We completed the Coke transactions and improved regulatory capital as a result. Our core earnings approximated the dividend, margin expanded, fee income remains steady and expense discipline continues.", "Tom just went through, asset quality is deteriorating. The pace of deterioration is slowing and the allowance has been increased to 1.46% of loans. While deterioration is slowing in certain portfolios, we expect residential construction related NPLs and charge-offs to continue increasing over the next several quarters.", "Overall, our current expectation for the third quarter charge-offs is to increase 15% to 20% over the second quarter.", "Thank you all for listening this morning. Operator, we are now ready to take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Our first question is from Matthew O'Connor. You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "UBS, thank you. It seems like one of the side benefits of getting the Coke treatment into Tier 1 is that you now have some flexibility issue hybrids if the market improves. I was just wondering if that's what you're referring to, when you talked about issuing capital earlier if we do get some improvement in the capital window.", "Mark Chancy", "Hey, Matt, this is Mark Chancy. We have issued in the past the hybrid securities. I specifically referenced the preferred purchase securities, which is a transaction that we have done in the past, and so it's along those lines that we will evaluate the market as we move forward into the third quarter and fourth.", "We've been evaluating the market for the past several quarters and made the overt decision not to try to access the market given the volatility and the increasing spread, given that we knew that the Coke related transactions were imminent and we did not feel that we needed the incremental capital at this point. We decided to defer that decision to the second half of the year, with hopefully credit spreads will tighten for us in the industry.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. I mean am I wrong in that you have about $400 million of the trust preferred capacity at this point, which is obviously a lot cheaper, at least in more normal environments than the regular preferred?", "Mark Chancy", "Matt, the number that I have in front of me is that we have about $0.5 billion dollars of the EPS capacity. I don't have the specific capacity level for the hybrids, but that would obviously be something that we would also evaluate.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 UBS", "", "Okay. Then just separately, the credit related expenses, those are going up at a pretty high clip here, and I guess even if we back off this $25 million of the mortgage insurance reserve, the $45 million year-over-year increase seems pretty big.", "Do you think you're trying to catch up to, where some other banks are? We're just not seeing that magnitude increase in some other places.", "Mark Chancy", "Let me start and then maybe Tom Freeman will pile on. What I\u2019d say is that, we have been aggressively adding to staff in both our mortgage and consumer lines of business in the collections area and related activities from a systems\u2019 standpoint, etcetera to make sure that we are well position to manage the increasing level of non-performing assets and to maximize the return on the investment in those assets that we have. That process has ramped up as you would expect in the second half.", "It started back, probably late '06, but really has accelerated in the second half of 2007, and into 2008, and that's why when you look on a year-over-year basis, the increase is significant. We also have OREO related costs that are also affecting that dollar amount, and the OREO costs back in the second quarter of '07, were not at the same levels that we're experiencing today.", "We are pleased that the average, when we dispose of a mortgage in connection with the foreclosure, and ultimate disposition process, our charge-off expectation that we take at the time it goes 180 days past due is relatively close to that ultimate disposition value, and the differential has been, 4%, 5%, and that cost is being born through the OREO line as opposed through the charge-offs, and that's one of the primary reasons for the large uptick along with the mortgage insurance cost that you referenced.", "With that let me stop for a second and see if Tom has anything to add.", "Tom Freeman", "I think we've made a very strong determination that we need to make sure we get as far out ahead of the credit related issues, specifically trying to make sure we have the right staff, doing the right things; that we move the credits to work out areas as quickly as we possibly can, which is really forced us to add significant resources on the collections and loss mitigation side..", "And additionally, we've added substantial amounts of people in doing the commercial work out to make sure we work through those, which is much alacrity is possible. So, we believe, relatively early here, and have been spending what is necessary to make sure that we identify our problems and work through them aggressively.", "Matthew O'Connor - UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Mike Mayo, you may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "Deutsche Bank. Good morning.", "Steve Shriner", "", "Good morning, Mike.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "Your guidance for loan losses was higher than, where you came in at. So, which areas that better than you expected? If you can just elaborate more on what you're saying with the fourth quarter, that should be consistent with the past couple quarters or you just don't know?", "Jim Wells", "The couple of areas where we had better than expected charge-offs is in the consumer area, our charge-offs were not, came in at less than what we expected. And in our commercial real estate area, we've had a couple of charge-offs which basically, we think will happen later this quarter rather in the third quarter rather than happened in the second quarter. Those were the two primary areas where charge-offs came in lower than expected.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "So, timing issue on the commercial side, but on the consumer side, why did it come in less?", "Jim Wells", "Actually, I believe a lot of it has to do with some of our loss mitigation efforts in terms of how we've gotten in, made sure that we had clarity in terms of where the charge-offs were coming from, the timing of the charge-offs and making sure that the charge-offs were taken in when they need to be taken plus, we've actually had some pretty good success in doing restructuring of some of our mortgage and home equity products during the last quarter, and I think that has had a mitigating effect on some of the charge-offs specifically on the consumer side of that.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "What do you mean by restructuring or what are you doing?", "Jim Wells", "These are our efforts to make sure that, where we have a borrower, who wants to stay in their home that we work with them to the best of our ability to put together either an extension in term, a modification in terms of mortgage payments, and just making sure that we restructure the mortgage facilities, whether they be first or second mortgages, in a way that is affordable to the customer and protects the interest of the bank.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "Would that typical loan be a non-performer?", "Jim Wells", "Actually, what happens is, if we significantly modify or take a write-down on the loan, in fact is a non-performer. We had, I believe, like about $130 million worth of that activity in the last quarter, so, we made modifications on those types of loans.", "We also, where we were able to keep those trouble debt restructures on an accruing basis, we also had about $115 million worth of them, which were non-accruals, and then we routinely do work with modification renewals and extensions against our customer base.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "So, it's not that much though?", "Jim Wells", "Well, it's 1900 loans. I think for the clients, that's a relatively significant number and some real significant activity for them.", "Mark Chancy", "Yeah, Mike, to your point, I think it's timing of recognition between second and third quarter and that's what we're trying to provide clarity on in terms of the increase on a quarter-over-quarter basis of 15% to 20% that we're expecting in the third quarter coming in a little bit lower than the expectation in the current quarter, and some of those being recognized here in July and August.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "And then the fourth quarter?", "Mark Chancy", "Yeah, as it relates to the fourth quarter, what we've said is that we don't expect charge-offs to be significantly higher or lower than that third quarter level at this point. So, we also indicate the visibility out beyond the quarter is challenging as you would expect.", "Mike Mayo - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. Alright, thanks.", "Steve Shriner", "Okay, Mike. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Nancy Bush. You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Yes, it\u2019s NAB Research. Good morning, guys. You've got a couple of very high rate payers in the southeast right now and indeed one of them nationally. There is a 4.25% 12 month CD out there then I'm sure you're well aware of.", "Just wondered how you're responding to this particularly in light of your comments about deposit pricing actually getting a bit better?", "James Wells", "Thanks, Nancy, it's a good question. Eugene Kirby who overseas our Retail Lines of Business will answer for you.", "Eugene Kirby", "Hi, Nancy. The competitive environment has gotten intense, but we have been able to hold our pricing and specifically target each region looking at the market conditions and have been able to manage our deposit pricing very effectively, and I think that people are shopping around today.", "I think we're seeing a lot of activity in the branches as people are concerned about the safety and soundness of other institutions, and in fact we're seeing very strong performance in some of our branches even without matching those rates.", "We do have the ability on a case-by-case basis to make decisions at the local level, when it's appropriate to compete, but on a portfolio level, we've been able to see our deposit rates actually come down and the mix shift as CDs have matured and a lot of our clients have actually moved out of CDs into either money-market or NOW accounts.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "And also along the same line, I think you said last quarter that you were beginning to deemphasize or lessen the marketing on My Cause and I'm just wondering how that product is doing and what your attitude toward it is right now?", "Eugene Kirby", "We've actually, Nancy, seen continued, very strong performance with My Cause and have continued that, and have intentions to continue that into the third and possibly into the fourth quarter.", "We have seen very, very strong growth in our core consumer checking households and our net new checking account, significantly outperforming the growth of the market in general and have been very pleased with that.", "We're focused now really on taking advantage of all of these new households that we've acquired through targeted cross-selling efforts, but it has been a very successful campaign and we have decided to continue.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Thank you.", "Steve Shriner", "Thanks, everyone. We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question is from Scott Valentin. You may ask your question and please state your company name.", "Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets", "FBR Capital Markets. Thanks for taking my question. Just real quick, I was trying to reconcile a pretty sharp growth in non-performing loans, while net charge-offs remained relatively stable link quarter, and you went through your charge-off policy, maybe just a case that you guys are fair valuing the assets pretty quickly. Can you give more color on that, why NPLs increased so much while charge-offs were relatively stable?", "Jim Wells", "I think if you take a look at one of our slides, where we were going over the reconciliation of where our charge-offs are going on. The charge-offs are really a flow item for the new non-performers coming in, and what we charge-off on a quarter to quarter basis.", "And while you seeing an increase in non-performers, the flow in during the quarter was fairly stable quarter-to-quarter and that's why the charge-offs are relatively stable over that same period of time.", "Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets", "Okay and just a quick follow-up. In the appendix section, total securities gains were $550 million. Is that all of the Coke transaction?", "Jim Wells", "Yes. Largely speaking, there maybe some very small incremental, but the bulk of that is the Coca-Cola transaction.", "Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jim Wells", "Okay.

", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website. Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Jim. ", "Jim Wells", "There are a few items I\u2019d like to review with you this morning and they\u2019re attached on slide three of the presentation. This morning we reported earnings per share of $0.88 for the third quarter which maintained our track record of profitability. There were a number of non-core items with both positive and negative impacts during the quarter and Mark Chancy will guide you through the financials in a moment so I\u2019ll only comment briefly.", "Looking past the non-core puts and takes revenue generation was stable. Our balance sheet, restructuring and deposit initiatives helped mitigate a consumer shift to higher cost deposits and the increased impact of non-performing assets on net interest income. Core non-interest income growth is positive despite a difficult environment in the mortgage and trust businesses. While I cannot tell you I am satisfied with our revenue performance it is gratifying to know that our efforts to grow and diversify this franchise are paying off especially given this most difficult environment.", "Our E\u00b2 efficiency and productivity program is yielding significant expense savings and we\u2019re pleased with how well managed core expenses have been excluding the non-interest expenses associated with credit. That said I do have to tell you that expense growth was too high even after adjusting for non-core items. The problem is non-interest costs inherent in the credit cycle. Particularly the abhorrently high cost at mortgage application fraud is inflicting on the industry and SunTrust.", "Moving on to some credit matters, net charge offs increased to 1.24% of loans while NPAs increased 24% to $3.7 billion in the quarter. Both of these outcomes were at the high end of the ranges we had anticipated. On the other hand our early stage delinquencies remain stable in the 1.5% range again this quarter. Additionally, the forward view of loss content in the existing portfolio increased less than in the past few quarters. The reserve growth of $112 million was lower than prior quarters and raised the loss reserve by eight basis points to 154 basis points.", "The bottom line is that asset quality has continued to deteriorate, while early stage delinquency has not increased significantly during the course of the year non-performing loans and charge offs have. The result of these trends in emerging economic information is that we expect losses will remain at cyclically higher levels for some period of time likely well into 2009. Of course the unknown in all of this is the fundamental health of the economy. ", "The current operating environment is the most challenging I have experienced. The most recent economic data, liquidity challenges, and the informed commentary from Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke all suggest essentially the down side risk could be significant. Ultimately the banks revenue generation, asset quality, and earnings depend on the economy.", "SunTrust while core third quarter results show that we are clearly profitable our earnings power is being impacted by the slower economic environment and it appears as though this pressure is unlikely to abate for at least the next quarter or two.", "On the topic of capital I am pleased to report significantly higher regulatory capital ratios at the end of the third quarter. Turning to slide four in the presentation you\u2019ll note that the Tier 1 Capital Ratio is estimated to be a healthy 8.15% up 68 basis points from the second quarter level of 7.47%. The increase is primarily related to the completion of the Coke transactions during the third quarter. The Tier One Ratio however also benefited from a reduction in risk weighted assets.", "The reduction in risk weighted assets occurred in part due to an ongoing effort to reduce illiquid trading securities, construction related loans and commitments and more generally to ensure than unused commitments are reduced and/or higher fees assessed. Other Capital Ratios increased during the quarter as well. Our total Capital Ratio exceeded 11%. Equity Assets was 10.3% and Tangible Equity to Tangible Assets was 6.4% which is one of the higher tangible ratios among large banks.", "Based on the results of actions taken during the last two quarters and our credit outlook today we believe that we are appropriately capitalized. We said during our earnings call last quarter that while we didn\u2019t think we needed significant additional capital we would continue to evaluate the capital markets to determine if regulatory capital could be raised in a cost effective manner. The public markets were not conducive to raising capital during the majority of the third quarter and so we did not access the market.", "As you all know the Treasury announced it will be making direct investments in selected institutions in the form of preferred securities. Given the progress we\u2019ve made in increasing regulatory capital we are in a position of strength and do not have a deep need for this capital. However, given the level of economic uncertainty it may be prudent to pursue this option particularly since the preferred stock is attractively priced. Furthermore, additional capital could better position us to take advantage of growth opportunities that I\u2019m sure will be available.", "As we enter 2009 we are evaluating our capital structure including our current regulatory intangible capital levels and the potential issuance of preferred securities under the TARP program. Our Board of Directors authorized an application to sell preferred stock to the US Treasury under that program and the potential range for SunTrust under the program is between $1.6 billion to $4.9 billion. ", "On a related note, last quarter we also talked about SunTrust dividend policy. We told you that we recognized that the payout ratio is high relative to our current earnings, that we viewed the current earnings pressures as shorter term and our dividend policy as longer term in nature and that we would be monitoring all of these subjects closely. ", "Core earnings were soft during the third quarter relative to our dividend and as I mentioned a moment ago the current outlook for the economy has deteriorated significantly in the past 30 to 45 days. We expect additional decisions related to our overall capital structure and dividend policy will be resolved in communicated properly. ", "Before turning it over to Mark I\u2019ll conclude by saying that we remain committed to existing business strategies, dedicated to executing initiatives related to deposits, expenses and managing risk and focused on creating shareholder value. I would also add that in doing these things we believe we are taking the steps necessary not only to continue to navigate successfully through the industry challenges that have been talked about on all calls like this over the past week or two but also to permit us to take advantage of opportunities that may present themselves in the current environment to grow our business, add to our client base and position ourselves for post cycle growth.", "I realize that with the potential impact of still volatile markets, economic weakness and related credit pressures hanging over our heads in the near term along with the prospect for fundamental changes in the relationship between our industry and our rule maker\u2019s longer term. To talk about opportunity just now seems a bit in congress, however we are convinced there are opportunities out there for SunTrust. Let me be very clear that managing responsibly through this crisis, controlling what we can control is our most immediate priority.", "We are monitoring market conditions on an hour by hour basis to make certain that we are doing everything we can to reduce our vulnerability to economic and market dislocations. That does not mean we cannot and should not also be looking beyond the current turmoil to the market stabilization and ultimate resumption of economic growth that history tells us will be forthcoming. ", "When it does we want to be ready. Our intent and expectation based on all that we see today is that when the clouds clear SunTrust will be in a strong competitive and financial position. In large measure, that\u2019s because of the great job being done every day by our employees and management team, many of whom are listening to this call. ", "Despite the onslaught of negative news our people are out there in the marketplace serving clients, attracting new ones, running our businesses more efficiently and doing all the things that make it possible for us to look beyond current pressures with a reasoned and realistic sense of confidence.", "I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Chancy", "I\u2019ll begin my comments today on slide five of the earnings presentation with a brief discussion of our funding profile and our liquidity position. Our funding strategy remains primarily centered on stable deposits which fund 91% of loans. As a result of the balance sheet restructuring in the first half of last year which resulted in a de-leveraging of the balance sheet by approximately $9 billion SunTrust has reduced its brokered and foreign deposit levels significantly.", "At quarter end deposits from consumer and commercial clients comprised 88% of total deposits while only 12% were brokered or foreign. An additional benefit of the 2007 balance sheet restructuring was that SunTrust entered the market turmoil in the second half of last year in a very strong liquidity position which remains today. The average daily overnight borrowing position is down significantly coincident with a 25% decrease in the brokered and foreign deposits.", "The long term senior debt of the institution is also well laddered. A holding company note maturity of $350 million occurred earlier in October and the next holding company maturity does not occur until October of \u201909. A final example of SunTrust\u2019s strong liquidity position is that contingent liquidity from the Federal Reserve, the Home Loan Bank and free securities that could be sold if necessary all of those exceed $28 billion currently.", "Before I move on I\u2019ll comment on a couple of other areas that may be of interest. Generally speaking the short term debt markets have been highly volatile over the past few weeks as you know. We have been fortunate however, that our three pillars asset backed Commercial Paper conduit has been able to fund on behalf of our commercial clients daily despite this liquidity crunch. Maturities have shortened as buying interest has largely been confined to overnight paper.", "Additionally, variable rate demand note re-marketing has been functioning relatively well. While rates have been volatile our inventory position has increased only nominally. We monitor these programs daily and have been pleased with the market receptivity of these SunTrust programs.", "Moving to slide six and a summary of our financial results, as Jim mentioned SunTrust earned $307 million in net income or $0.88 per share in the third quarter. There were a lot of non-core items however affecting the results which I will cover a little later in the call. One item though that I want to cover now is related to provision for taxes which was actually a benefit this quarter despite the positive pre-tax income. ", "The reason and the primary driver was $68.5 million of reversal of a deferred tax liability associated with the contribution of 3.6 million shares of the Coca-Cola common stock to our charitable foundation which we outlined for you during our second quarter earnings call. I\u2019ll cover other items affecting our overall results in a minute.", "Let\u2019s move to slide seven and the balance sheet. Overall average loan balances excluding non-accruals remained flat during the third quarter. Although particular targeted areas such as commercial and consumer direct exhibited good growth. Home equity lines grew as well but that is more a result of very low attrition against normal draw volume.", "Declines continued in areas where we are intentionally shrinking the portfolio namely specific areas of mortgage, construction, and indirect auto. On the deposit front average deposits in the quarter declined from the second quarter level primarily driven by lower CDs and DDA resulting from increased deposit competition and a general strain on consumer and commercial liquidity. ", "Largely offsetting the decline in these products was an increase in money market accounts. This growth was influenced by sales strategies in which money market products were used a lead product to help us retain a greater portion of maturing CDs and other client balances.", "I\u2019ll spend a moment discussing deposit flows as I think it is interesting how the quarter unfolded. In July and August the trend was similar to what I just outlined. Balances trended down mostly in CDs and DDAs while money market balances increased. This trend reversed significantly in late September coincident with increased media coverage of credit and liquidity conditions impacting some other organizations.", "From a low of just of $100 billion at the end of August core customer deposits increased by $1.8 billion to end September at $101.8 billion. That incremental growth was spread across most products. Since then balances have continued to grow though the rate of growth has tapered off in the last week or so as Government actions appear to be calming nervous depositors.", "I\u2019ll now take a moment to cover the margin on slide eight. Margin declined this quarter relative to both last quarter and last year. Industry factors including competition for CDs that I just mentioned played a role in not meeting our expectations for a stable to increasing margin however there were a number of items that we simply did not anticipate that drove margin down this quarter.", "One of those relates to the significant spike in LIBOR that occurred during September. That sharp increase had a negative impact due to the fact that our loans based on LIBOR typically re-price early in the month while our LIBOR based liabilities re-price throughout the month. Additionally, the accrued interest reversal on new non-performing loans was slightly larger than we anticipated as the mix of new NPLs shifted to construction and commercial.", "Furthermore, two additional events occurred late in the month that negatively impacted margin. First, we were notified at the end of September that the Atlanta Federal Home Loan Bank had decided to lower its dividend. Second, based on recent court resolutions with other industry participants we made a decision to modestly increase our reserves associated with the very few leveraged leases or LILOs that we have on our books.", "Clearly margin has been difficult to predict given the volatility in interest rates and competitive positioning for deposits. We currently believe that margin is stabilized and has more up side opportunity than down side and you\u2019ll see on the slide that we\u2019ve provided a list of foreseeable key risks as well as opportunities for growth in the margin as we look forward.", "Moving to slide nine, Tom\u2019s going to cover credit in great detail in just a minute so I\u2019ll be brief here. Net charge-offs increased to $392 million or 1.24% of loans which was in line with the high end of our expectations, $112 million of provision was recorded in excess of net charge-offs and this excess provision increase the allowance ratio to 1.54%. ", "In addition, while I just noted that average loans did not increase during the quarter we did experience strong commercial loan growth late in the period which required reserving. This growth was largely driven by the disruption in the short term corporate funding markets resulting in certain commercial and large corporate clients turning to bank lines for funding. Modest growth also occurred but it slowed during early October.", "Moving to slide 10 let me talk about non-interest income for a minute. Reported non-interest income growth was 57% however there were a number of non-core items that impacted the quarter and after adjusting for these items the growth was approximately 2%. Several components of non-interest income generated solid growth including services charges on deposits, investment banking income, card fees, and mortgage servicing. However, this growth was largely offset by decreases in trust and investment management as well as mortgage production income.", "You\u2019ll note that mortgage production is up on a reported basis however after adjusting the third quarter of 2007 for certain write downs that occurred last year 2008 mortgage production income is lower due primarily to a 36% reduction in originations. Notable non-core items this quarter included a significant widening of spreads on our publicly traded debt carried at fair value which resulted in income of $341 million.", "As I\u2019ll discuss in detail in a minute the third quarter also included $173 million of expected losses related to auction rate securities and $137 million in mark to market losses on illiquid trading securities and loan warehouses. The last item that I\u2019ll mention is the gain on sale of $82 million which was generated from the sale of our fuel card business which we had previously announced, that company was called Transplatinum. ", "Let\u2019s move over to slide 11 and talk about the acquired securities portfolio which we have been aggressively managing down over the past several quarters. We have decreased our exposure to these securities by 90% compared to the original value including a 55% reduction during the third quarter. Over $355 million of securities were sold in the third quarter and the balance at quarter end was less than $350 million in total.", "Approximately $13 million in mark to market losses were recorded during the third quarter on these securities as we believe that we have taken the bulk of anticipated losses on these assets already. I\u2019ll note that we carefully consider market pricing and sell the assets when it is reasonable as compared to our view on intrinsic value and our carrying value.", "We do expect the rate of portfolio reductions to slow going forward particularly given the relative complexity of the SIV securities and the uncertain timing regarding their restructuring efforts. However, we do expect this portfolio to be below $300 million by the end of the year which will be substantial accomplishment relative to our starting position at the beginning of 2008.", "Offsetting some of our progress in this area are certain illiquid securities purchased during the third quarter along with those that we expect to purchase during the fourth quarter and I\u2019ll cover those next on slide 12.", "In total during the third quarter we recorded $236 million in write downs on the following securities. We purchased a $70 million note issued by Lehman Brothers and we purchased it from one of our Ridgeworth Money Market Mutual Funds and recognized a $64 million loss on this note. In addition, we previously announced an anticipated settlement regarding SunTrust\u2019s sale of Auction Rate Securities to selected clients.", "While we have an agreement in principle it is not yet final and as such we have not repurchased many of the securities. However, we did record $173 million charge in the third quarter reflecting our best estimate of what the fair value write downs and fines will be upon purchase in future periods. The agreement covers clients who purchased just under $500 million in par valued securities and the charge related to these securities was $85 million.", "We also plan to voluntarily offer to purchase from certain additional client\u2019s auction rate securities totaling $265 million at par with an anticipated additional write down of $88 million. The total mark down on these securities of roughly 23% of par is appropriate in our opinion given that roughly $100 million of the securities relates to auction rate securities where the underlying notes are senior tranches of small bank trust preferred securities that have little to no liquidity in today\u2019s market. The underlying assets of the remaining $625 million are municipal and student related securities.", "Let me end my part of this mornings call now with a discussion of non-interest expense on slide 13. On a reported basis non-interest expense increase 29% when compared with the third quarter \u201907. However, when you adjust for non-core items which include $183 million charitable expense in connection with the Coke stock contribution and a $20 million increase in our Visa litigation reserve expenses grew 11% over last quarter and 16% over the same quarter last year.", "This expense increase is entirely due to credit related expenses. If you look at expenses without considering those related to credit you can see that there was virtually no growth over last quarter or even over the same quarter last year. However, these credit related costs continue to increase. As expected we recorded another $48 million in reserves for expected losses related to our Twin Rivers mortgage re-insurance company. ", "However, mortgage application fraud is the real story. The run rate cost of fraud losses effectively doubled versus last year and last quarter. Further we established a $40 million reserve during the quarter for expected future fraud related losses.", "Moving to slide 14 I\u2019ll reiterate though that core expenses excluding credit related costs have been very well managed and we show no growth when you look at expenses this way. It\u2019s important to note that these numbers still include the personnel and related expenses associated with hundreds of newly hired people currently required for default management. What I\u2019m getting at is that expenses would be shrinking if not for the credit cycle. ", "While we don\u2019t think the cycle will change in the near term we have created a much leaner and more efficient organization that is difficult to recognize given the layers of credit related expenses we\u2019re experiencing in the current environment. Third quarter gross savings related to our efficiency and productivity initiatives reached $149 million and we expect full year 2008 savings to approximate $540 million as we don\u2019t anticipate an additional increase in the run rate during the fourth quarter.", "Looking to 2009 we are on track and committed to delivering our goal of $600 million in gross savings. As you know we\u2019ve been at this for some time and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to achieve. It\u2019s paramount to run an efficient organization and during difficult economic times it is particularly important. We have seen a major cultural shift in our organization around efficiency and productivity and is certainly serving us well given the operating environment.", "Now with that let me turn it over to Tom Freeman.", "Tom Freeman", "This morning I\u2019m going to provide a review of our credit situation beginning with an overview of the portfolio metrics on slide 15 of the presentation. The overall credit picture is a deterioration in the third quarter continued at a pace consistent with our expectations and market conditions. Net charge offs increase to $392 million or 124 basis points annualized. ", "The increase in net charge-offs this quarter equates to just over 20% which is at the high end of the outlook we provided in July and consistent with the expectations in early September. You will recall that our second quarter charge offs came in at the low end of our expectations.", "Provision expense increased in the quarter to $504 million up from $448 million. The allowance ended the quarter at $1.9 billion or 154 bass points of loans outstanding. This is an increase of $112 million and an eight basis point increase in reserve ratio. The rate of growth in the allowance is lower than in prior quarters. ", "Non-performing assets increased $717 million during the quarter to $3.7 billion. NPAs increased at a faster pace in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. The rate of growth in construction and commercial NPAs increased during the quarter in contrast to a slower growth rate in residential mortgage and home equity lines of credit.", "The growth in NPAs is due in part to time it takes to get through the foreclosure process particularly in judicial jurisdictions. Judicial foreclosure states have slowed the process and it can take from six months to well over a year to complete the foreclosure process. Our capacity to dispose of the assets once they are owned is satisfactory and well within our pricing expectations.", "We remain comfortable with our allowance relative to non-performers in part due to significant charge offs we have already recognized on the real estate secured NPLs and our specific reserve process. If you exclude only the residential mortgage NPLs that have been through the write down process disclosed on slide 19 the ALLL to NPL ratio would exceed 80%. ", "Additionally, as construction and commercial NPLs increase its important to remember that specific reserves are held against NPLs that have balances of $2 million or more. While these charge offs have not yet occurred pending resolution or renegotiation we do hold specific reserves against all the impaired loans in excess of $2 million which reduces the carrying value of these loans to our current view of net realizable value.", "Finally, we have noted the flat trend in early stage delinquency in each of our presentations this year. The pattern continued in the third quarter. Overall 30 to 89 day delinquency was 152 basis points which is up a few basis points from last quarter but basically at the same level since the end of last year.", "Next I\u2019ll provide an overview of product performance on slide 16. The commercial and commercial real estate portfolios comprise 43% of our portfolio and are performing reasonably well overall. Within this combined $54 billion commercial portfolio is $5.5 billion of loans to small business clients. Third quarter charge offs from this portfolio segment which is 10% of the overall commercial book amounted to almost 50% of total charge offs in these categories.", "However, the charge off ratio in the small business segment was a respectable 1.6%. Additionally the growth in C&I charge offs is not indicative of any significant broadening of credit issues within our commercial client base. Outside of those entities directly tied to construction or highly cyclical businesses.", "The product category commercial real estate is our non-residential commercial real estate book. That includes both owner occupied and income producing collateral with roughly two thirds being owner occupied properties. Performance in this pool is holding up well. The consumer portfolio which includes direct, indirect and student loans is also performing reasonably well given the current environment. The portfolio with the most elevated credit metrics are the real estate product categories at the bottom of the slide.", "I\u2019ll cover each of these in more detail in a minute and you will see the credit issues are concentrated in certain sub-segments of these portfolios. If you turn to slide 17 in the deck I\u2019ll provide a view of non-accrual loans, composition and trends. It will not surprise you to see that non-accruals are dominated by loans secured by residential real estate. Residential mortgages and home equity lines represent 54% of non-accruals. If we include residential construction the non-accruals related to residential real estate are 75% of total non-accruals. We expect to see continued increases in this segment over the near term.", "Construction non-accruals have been increasing over the past several quarters and currently total just over $1 billion. As I noted earlier we have specific reserves on a loan by loan basis for a majority of the dollar volume of these non-accruals.", "Please turn to slide 18 for a review of the residential real estate portfolio. Overall non-accruals and delinquencies are up across most segments in the mortgage portfolio. Within the highest risk segment Alt-A balances continue to run off and non-accruals declined versus last quarter. While the 60 plus delinquency ratios are up the primary driver for the increasing ratios is lower portfolio balances. We actually like that trade off.", "However, notable in the quarter is the increase in delinquencies and non-accruals in the core portfolio which increased 33 basis points and $162 million respectively. We believe this increase reflects the overall weakening of our consumer credit as we have noted no particular pattern or similarity among the merging delinquent loans.", "While this ARM portfolio continues to perform favorable compared to external indices for prime ARM portfolios risk in this segment is rising. The prime\u2019s second portfolio which is also referred to Combo seconds or piggy backs is just under $4 billion and is insured. Given rising delinquencies and non-accruals in this portfolio I will update you on the insurance.", "There are a number of discrete pools of insuring loans within this portfolio. In all of them insurance covers cumulative losses of up to 5%. SunTrust bears any pool cumulative losses exceeding 5% and up to 8%. Insurance applies again to cumulative losses of up to 10%. A few of the pools are exhibiting behavior suggesting that the 5% attachment could possibly be reached during 2009. For these insured loans we will establish loss reserves when we believe losses at this level have been incurred.", "Given current trends it is possible that forecasts prepared in the next quarter or two may show losses above the 5% on some of these pools. The bottom line is that in the unlikely event that all the pools at the attachment point which we do not expect are expected incremental loss exposure would be less than $120 million. Unless total losses exceed the 10% cumulative insurance gap which we also not expect. The last note on this slide is to remind that there is no sub-prime, option ARM or other negative amortizing loan products in our portfolio.", "Next I\u2019ll update you on losses recognized and loss severity in the mortgage portfolio on slide 19. Non-accrual balances increased versus last quarter and two third of total balances have been written down to realizable market value. As a reminder write downs are based upon updated collateral valuations at 180 days past due and only loans which are well secured relative to realizable value or have private mortgage insurance do not require write down. ", "Generally the write downs reduce loan balances to 85% of current estimated disposition value. Our experience to date is ultimate disposition values are within a few percentage points of these values.", "Loss severities are also illustrated on this slide by subset and they remain at levels consistent with our expectations given original loan to values and declining market prices for real estate. Loss severities have not increased meaningfully since last quarter.", "The last point on this slide is that $444 million of non-accruals have not yet been written down. This will be the primary pool of mortgages which will have write downs during the fourth quarter. The balance is up from the second quarter and while most of the increases in the core portfolio with lower loss the increased balance suggests charge offs in the fourth quarter will be consistent with the third quarter.", "Moving to slide 20 and the home equity line of credit portfolios, home equity line of credit non-accruals and charge offs increased from the seasonally low second quarter levels as we had anticipated. This portfolio is performing poorly with overall charge offs approaching 3% annualized in the quarter. Each quarter we have provided a breakdown of the portfolio showing a stack ranking of performance from worst to best, to give you perspective on the source and level of risk.", "Two thirds of the portfolio is in the bottom row. This portfolio segment is branch originated and low loan to value but is showing some weakness as annualized charge offs in the third quarter were 1.5%. You will note that portfolio balances have increased quarter over quarter. This growth is in the lowest risk segment and results from a lack of typical payoff, pay down attrition and normal line utilization on lines originated in late 2000 and 2008 under substantially more conservative underwriting guidelines.", "The last portfolio I\u2019m going to cover today is construction which begins on slide 21. Charge offs and NPLs have increased while balances and 30 plus delinquencies are down. Overall construction balances declined by 8% versus last quarter with the most notable decline of 21% in construction deferment. Also significant was a 10% decline in SunTrust originated construction loans. ", "However that reduction was partially offset by a 6% increase created by the inclusion of GB&T loans leading to a net 4% decline in this segment. All in all construction loans declined by $1 billion quarter to quarter. Commercial purpose construction portfolio represents roughly one third of the total construction book and continues to perform well. ", "Please turn to slide 22 for a wrap up on our higher risk portfolio segments and mitigating actions. The subset of portfolios under significant stress comprises just 12% of our total loan book. We\u2019ve been taking aggressive actions to mitigate the risk. In residential mortgages we eliminated Alt-A portfolio lending in mid 2006. We have significantly tightened underwriting guidelines across all of our products and have augmented our default management capabilities with people, enhanced processes and tools.", "On home equity lines we have eliminated origination of home equity product through third party channels, eliminated all loans greater than 85% loan to value, originated from all channels, implemented market specific loan to value guidelines in declining markets and then aggressively reducing line commitments in higher risk situations.", "We began tightening in late 2006 in residential construction, as a result balances and exposures are down considerably particularly in Florida and Atlanta. While NPLs and charge offs have risen and will increase from here the ultimate realization of risk will be much less than it otherwise could have been. ", "Slide 23 contains a brief summary of key take aways from today\u2019s credit discussion. Credit deterioration was consistent with market conditions and our expectations during the third quarter. Early stage delinquencies remain stable. The commercial and commercial real estate portfolios continue to perform reasonably well. ", "The majority of non-accruals continued to be residential mortgages and we have written two thirds down to expected recoverable values. Credit issues remain largely confined to residential real estate segments of the portfolio and we continue to be aggressively managing this risk. ", "I\u2019ll conclude my remarks with an outlook for charge offs. The current internal forecast shows net charge offs in the fourth quarter up approximately 20% driven by continued weakness in the consumer sectors. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Shriner", "We\u2019ve covered a lot today so before we take some questions I\u2019ll quickly summarize key messages from the presentation that are included on slide 24. Tier 1 regulatory capital improved significantly 8.15%. We continue to have stable core deposit centric funding and a strong liquidity position. We have begun to see commercial loan growth and a recent up trend in deposits. Overall earnings are being negatively impacted by the underlying economic environment and credit.", "Asset quality deteriorated in line with expectations during the third quarter. As Tom just said our current credit outlook is for further deterioration in the near term with fourth quarter charge offs up approximately 20% from third quarter levels. Our Board has provided authorization to apply for a preferred stock sale under the TARP program. We are evaluating our overall capital structure and we\u2019ll provide additional external communications as promptly as we can.", "Thank you very much for listening this morning. Operator we\u2019re now ready to take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Early stage delinquencies have been flat at 1.5% in each of the past four quarters but NPAs are growing and the dollar volume of that growth is steadily increasing. I understand flow rates mathematically but conceptually what\u2019s the disconnect between the early stage delinquency and NPA trends right now?", "Tom Freeman", "The disconnect is fairly simple is our ability to gain control of the properties which have gone to delinquencies and charge off is really impacted by a slow down in our ability to foreclose on the properties. If we had normal flows and normal time frames that would be matching up much better and we\u2019d be able to break down the inventory of what would then be owned real estate properties short of bulk selling notes which we think is not an economic option for the company we\u2019ve got to fight this through the courts. ", "We\u2019re starting to pick up some velocity around that and it\u2019s in some of our jurisdictions taking as long as 18 to 24 months to begin to get our hands on the properties. That\u2019s really what the backup is.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That would be Florida specifically?", "Tom Freeman", "We have several states within the jurisdictions that we work with which are judicial foreclosure states. Those have been painfully slow.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "It sounded from the comments like you\u2019re more open to cutting the dividend. I just want to make sure that\u2019s the right interpretation. Its been somewhat surprising that there haven\u2019t been more dividend cuts across the industry is there any focus or pressure from the regulators for the industry to rationalize dividends to hunker down for a more difficult environment.", "Mark Chancy", "As we mentioned we are very pleased with our current regulatory capital position as well as our tangible equity to asset position. We are, because of the economic and credit environment as we move into 2009 thoroughly evaluating our capital structure in connection with that deterioration. We\u2019re also authorized as we indicated this morning by our Board to evaluate the par capital program and we\u2019re in the midst of that evaluation. ", "Our overall capital structure will include the review of each of our current position, our dividend policy and the TARP program and when that evaluation is complete we\u2019ll be back and communicate any results to the marketplace as promptly as possible. As far as any specific guidance by the regulators I really have no comment on that and can\u2019t speculate about how they might be communicating with others within the industry.", "Brian Foran \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "The cumulative mark to market on the debt is now over $600 million. Is there any opportunity to actually buy some of this debt to lock in that gain and prevent a situation where that reverts over time?", "Mark Chancy", "Yes, that is one of the options that we\u2019ve actually acted upon during the course of 2008 and it is one of the options that is available to us and we\u2019re continuing to evaluate it. As you know it does not affect capital, is non-cash and is a reflection of the very volatile financial markets that we\u2019re operating in. We\u2019re real clear and transparent about the fact that that is a non-core gain that\u2019s reflected in our earnings. That\u2019s not something that we\u2019re trying to incorporate as a core part of the company\u2019s earnings. ", "We do expect that it will reverse itself over time. SunTrust debt will revert as we mature back to the original spreads when it was issued and so that\u2019s clearly an event over the next seven years but to your point there may be opportunities for us to pursue additional purchases of that debt and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate it as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch.", "Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "You talked about accessing the TARP in terms of additional preferred equity. Could you give us some context on to the extent that you do add preferred equity issued to the Treasury that that would be essentially sit on the balance sheet and you would enhance your Tier 1 capital ratio and keep it at an elevated level or is there some opportunity to lever that or deploy it so that your Tier 1 ratio would stay in that 8% to 8.5% range and we could expect therefore some incremental earnings to come from that extra equity.", "Mark Chancy", "Certainly if we were to actually pursue and issue the preferred stock we would be looking to deploy that in an appropriate manner as we move forward both through organic growth through potential purchases of different assets as well as pursuing acquisitions to the extent that they were accretive and strategically appropriate for SunTrust to pursue. We have a wide variety of methods that we could deploy that capital if management and the Board decided that was the appropriate course based on the terms and conditions that are still being evaluated by us and others across the marketplace.", "I would clearly expect for us to deploy that capital across each of the different mechanisms that I just outlined if the company were actually to issue the preferred stock.", "Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "We should not think about you going to say something around a 10% Tier 1 capital ratio and keeping it there for a while.", "Mark Chancy", "If we were to issue the immediate impact would be, depending upon the dollar amount that we issued at a significant increase in our Tier 1 capital level. What I\u2019m indicating is you shouldn\u2019t expect for it to remain at that level over the long term because we wouldn\u2019t take the capital down if we didn\u2019t intend to deploy it. We are pleased, as we mentioned with our current capital position. ", "We do not have, as Jim mentioned a deep need for incremental capital. We think that the program is an appropriate program for the industry and it provides strong institutions like SunTrust the ability to raise capital on a very cost effective basis and so we\u2019re thoroughly evaluating it as you might expect.", "Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "I\u2019m looking at your trading account profits of a positive $121 million. I think when I make all the adjustments I start with $121 million, I back out the $341 million on mark to market debt, I add back $173 million on the auction rate securities and I add back $137 million on the trade\u2026", "Mark Chancy", "Why don\u2019t you just give Steve a call and he\u2019ll walk you through those details.", "Ed Najarian - Merrill Lynch", "I\u2019m coming to a $90 million trading number on a net basis is that approximately accurate and if so what drove higher trading revenue this quarter.", "Steve Shriner", "I can work you through the details but the bottom line is that trading line contains core business revenue derived primarily through our SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Investment Banking business. There\u2019s a lot of core client revenue that runs through there including fixed interest rate risk management derivatives and other products but I\u2019m happy to go in more detail on that later. That\u2019s a high level answer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "On expenses you\u2019re controlling what you can control but expenses were up a little bit, $149 million third quarter savings from E\u00b2 and so annualized you\u2019re at the $600 million run rate which is your \u201909 target?", "Mark Chancy", "Yes, that was the number that we realized. We mentioned that we\u2019re not anticipating any additional increase in the fourth quarter so we\u2019re on track for about $540 million or so during the course of 2008 and it gives us confidence as you mentioned that we should be able to meet or hopefully exceed the $600 million target that we set a couple of years ago. As you might expect in today\u2019s environment our evaluation has not stopped. ", "The environment has only poised us to do further evaluation of ways that we can become more cost effective in the way we operate our business and you can be assured that we\u2019re continuing those efforts but we have no new information at this point to communicate.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "At this point we shouldn\u2019t assume any additional savings from E\u00b2 from your current run rate but you\u2019re working on perhaps new plans.", "Mark Chancy", "Yes, correct we have ongoing initiatives that we\u2019ve outlined in the past related to our supplier management as an example. Those efforts are continuing and to extent that we have new information for you as we move into 2009 we\u2019ll provide it.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "On credit quality, it looks like 12% of the portfolio is what you guys term distressed and that\u2019s most of your charge offs. I want to focus on the rest of the portfolio specifically commercial. I think you mentioned small business I guess that got worse but still in a decent range. What else are you seeing in commercial between retailers and I guess even some restaurants are going chapter 11. What\u2019s moving up on your watch list?", "Tom Freeman", "What we\u2019re seeing is our concerns are quite honestly right now are publishing which is showing some real signs of softness and continued fallout in the small business segment. We don\u2019t have substantial retail exposures especially on a small granular level. Quite honestly other than the publishing part of the portfolio and one episodic incident in the energy book the rest of the portfolio is holding up fairly well.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "What do you mean by publishing?", "Tom Freeman", "Newspapers.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I just haven\u2019t noticed any failing around, that I\u2019ve noticed.", "Tom Freeman", "We have.", "Mike Mayo \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "That\u2019s in the increase in commercial this quarter?", "Tom Freeman", "Yes sir.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A couple questions on the credit side, one is on the reserving methodology I know you have a little bit of a different approach towards the reserving compared to peers and I think it has to do with how you estimate the recoverable value of the NPAs. Could you just refresh on how you are, interesting the expected recoverable value on the residential mortgages, where your inputs are coming from and how they have changed over the past quarter?", "Tom Freeman", "I don\u2019t believe our approach is different than what industry standard is. In fact we\u2019re very careful to make sure our estimates are consistent with all of the GAAP guidance around documentation and estimation of current losses realizable, expected within the existing portfolio. That being said, I think you\u2019re asking a slightly different question which is as we begin to get people into the collection queue for residential mortgages what do we do to estimate values upon ultimate recovery upon sale of the non-performing assets and I think that\u2019s the question is that correct?", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Sure.", "Tom Freeman", "What we do is at 120 days as is required by GAAP and FFIEC we put the loans on non-performing, non-accrual. We then commission appraisals and valuations of the individual properties, on a property by property basis. Then when we get the value in we take a haircut off of that by, it depends upon specific markets, about 15% overall. That becomes our carrying value for the underlying assets. ", "Upon sale of the assets, and as we accumulate all of the performance around sale of the assets we re-estimate whether or not our haircut and valuation methodology was appropriate to make sure we\u2019re recognizing the loss flows as they ought to be so we have a check and balance around that to make sure that our estimation process falls within a reasonable range and that we\u2019re pretty tight on the estimate of losses.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "How has the loss come in relative to what you had been estimating?", "Tom Freeman", "As we continue to a rolling evaluation we\u2019ve seen softening of values. We\u2019ve seen a lot of softening of values in the Florida market and we continue to make sure that on a daily, weekly and monthly basis that those estimates are current value estimates. We continue to see softness especially in Florida but we\u2019re seeing softness around some of the other markets.", "Mark Chancy", "One of the reasons why we provide this slide that we do in the presentation deck is as Tom mentioned when we get to 180 days we go ahead and incur a charge off against those non-performing loans even if they haven\u2019t been disposed of because of the process. We note in that slide the level of non-performers that have already incurred a charge off and have been written down to what we expect to be realizable value based on current value estimates and that\u2019s about two thirds of the non-performers that relate to that mortgage segment.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "As housing values continue to fall here we should anticipate that the reserving should move up to reflect that is that correct?", "Tom Freeman", "The charge offs will continue to move up and then we\u2019ll make sure, the reserving question we\u2019re talking about charge offs not reserve. In the reserve process you also have to take a look at the mix and if you take a look at where we\u2019ve taken a majority of the charge offs those were in closed in pools and those loopholes continue to shrink. As we evaluate any other emerging problems you\u2019ll have a separate set of evaluations.", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "A separate question on more the commercial side but given the foreign exchange volatility how are you assessing risks that you might have in your own commercial book?", "Mark Chancy", "Could you repeat your question?", "Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "On the commercial side there is some emerging stress in foreign exchange markets and I know while you don\u2019t have much of an exposure outside the US I\u2019m sure you deal with corporates who have exposure to foreign exchange revenue flows or may engage with you in foreign exchange hedging. I just wanted to understand what you may or may not be seeing in the commercial book in terms of new stresses relative to the foreign exchange volatility that\u2019s been increasing here over the past several weeks.", "Mark Chancy", "We have very minor exposure to foreign exchange swaps and trades it\u2019s not a big number for us. As with any of our clients which are multi-jurisdictional and where you have multi-currency we do regular reviews, we do regular credit evaluations and we include into that the exposure specifically to foreign markets and in fact one of the things we\u2019ve been paying a lot of attention to lately in our larger corporate clients has been the strengthening of the dollar and how that\u2019s affecting their income flows in future periods.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup.", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "On non-performing assets management you\u2019re sitting on a portfolio of about $3.6 billion, I know you had mentioned that you felt that securing values in certain parts of the portfolio would be reflective of where you thought you could liquidate it. You\u2019ve had a peer comment, during the quarter they sold about $430 million of non-performers during the quarter took about a 50% haircut related to where they were carrying it. In terms of color going forward how, maybe more focused on the construction segment how do you intend, or strategize around peering the size of that portfolio down as you move out into the future?", "Tom Freeman", "You\u2019ve got to remember that we started on the construction portfolio in \u201906 and really have been restructuring, attacking the portfolio and if you take a look at it that portfolio is falling by about $1 billion a quarter. The construction portfolio I think we\u2019ve got specific plans on, we have evaluations in terms of any of the ones which are troublesome we have a specific reserve process and quite honestly we\u2019re doing restructures where appropriate, foreclosures where appropriate and dispositions. ", "It is the most aggressive thing that we have been working through in terms of making sure that that portfolio continues to right size in looking forward at what kind of the economic activity is going to be. I think that portfolio when you look at our construction firms and our commercial construction activity will continue to downsize aggressively over the next couple of quarters.", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "Taking a counter view here on the dividend and Mark probably more addressed to you. In terms of looking at the holding company you\u2019ve got over $2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. The quarterly upstream from the banks about $330 million in dividends, you guys are earning right at that maybe slightly less but with TARP the potential of injecting $1 to almost $4 billion of cash into the holding company I know you\u2019re working through this and its tough for you to comment on right now. ", "Is it plausible or maybe you can add some color in how you would think about is it plausible that you keep the dividend at the current level because of the cash level you have at the holding company or potentially could have?", "Mark Chancy", "Obviously we are evaluating all of the aspects that go into managing holding company liquidity, the dividend, and our overall capital structure and taking both our own information, the changes in the economic and credit landscape as well as the potential to access the Government program into consideration. As we work through that it\u2019s something that has continued to move as you know with new information coming out on the Government programs on a daily basis and so we\u2019re doing a careful evaluation as you would expect us to and we\u2019re going to respond promptly as it relates to all the capital structure related items as soon as it makes sense to both us and our Board.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Jefferson Harralson \u2013 KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - KBW", "I\u2019m looking at page 21 this might be similar to Greg\u2019s question. If you have, let\u2019s call it 9% total NPAs in the construction portfolio or 14% NPLs of that middle part, the residential construction portfolio and we sort of live in a seemingly 50% on the dollar world. Help square that against the charge offs that seem to be running at less than 2%, it\u2019s a way of asking of this $1.40 billion it seems like there would be a lot of loss content in that outside looking in maybe I\u2019m missing something I wanted to ask you about how those two numbers square.", "Tom Freeman", "If you take a look at the commercial part of the portfolio you\u2019ve got to understand what the process is. Some of the losses will be realized upon recognition of events. We have made reserves which we believe are fully adequate to cover those losses but those losses are coming in future quarters.", "Jefferson Harralson - KBW", "Did I miss it or how much is reserved against the $1.40 billion?", "Tom Freeman", "What I can tell you is about 65% of the portfolio is covered by specific reserves.", "Steve Shriner", "Thank you everybody for attending this morning.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference thank you for participating you may disconnect at this time.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions) I'd like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Steve Shriner, the Director of Investor Relations.", "Steve Shriner", "Good morning. Welcome to SunTrust's second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during the call today. Slide 2 outlines the content which include the capital update, an overview of our financial results and an in-depth credit review.", "The press release presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the investor relations section of the website.", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter, including details on our capital position. Mark with then discuss financial performance, and Tom will conclude with an in-depth review of asset quality.", "At the conclusion of the formal remarks, we'll open the session for questions.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings which are available on our website. Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the statements are made, and we disclaim any responsibility to do so.", "During the call, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit, nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live webcasts are located on our website. With that, let me turn it over to Jim.", "James Wells", "Good morning everyone. Thanks for being with us this morning. I'm going to begin on Slide 3 of the deck. Similar to last quarter, this quarter's story boils down to a few main themes, most evident obviously being we are still working through credit and earnings challenges as the weak economy continues to impact performance, yet we did see some positive trends during the quarter and preliminary signs of improvement in several areas.", "While we're obviously not pleased to report a loss for the quarter, we are encouraged by this quarter's results, specifically our strong deposit growth, increasing net interest margin, positive fee income growth within certain areas, strong expense management and lower early stage delinquency rates.", "Additionally, we further enhanced capital, improved liquidity and bolstered reserve. We have the strength and resources necessary to continue to manage through sustain economic weakness. As you know, we completed our capital actions and exceeded the government's capital requirement. I'll spend more time outlining those actions and their impact in a few moments. ", "As I've said before, we are acutely focused here on the client, on improving service quality and front line execution, on controlling expenses and on managing risk and I believe we're doing a good job controlling what we can control and taking advantage of opportunities, the results of which are evidenced in many places in our core performance this quarter.", "However this positive underlying picture clearly is overshadowed by the impact of recession related pressures.", "We reported a loss of $0.41 per share this morning. This loss reflects cyclically high credit charges and soft revenue in certain areas. Although overall revenue remains depressed, second quarter results included increased net interest margin and capital markets revenue along with another strong quarter with mortgage related revenue.", "Expenses were well managed again this quarter; however, post cyclical FDIC pension and credit expenses continue to impact results, and though you've heard me say this many times before, it bears repeating because it's an important point. Expense control and vigilance is effectively engrained in this culture at SunTrust. ", "Throughout the organization we are not only focused on managing expenses we can control, but we're also dedicated and working to uncover additional opportunities to improve efficiency and operating performance.", "I'm also tremendously pleased with the deposit generation progress we've made over the last several quarters. We reported another record for consumer and commercial deposits, reaching $114 billion at quarter end. While of course growth is industry wide, there are strong indications that part of the increase is SunTrust specific.", "This reflects favorably on the tremendous effort being put forth by our team to improve our deposit generation and retention capabilities.", "Overall asset quality deteriorated in the quarter as evidenced by higher charge offs and increasing non performing loan levels. Losses and risk remain largely concentrated in residential real estate secured portfolios and early stage delinquencies in those categories showed improvement.", "I will add that we are seeing increased strain in certain economically sensitive industries within our commercial portfolios. Tom will provide more detail later on the call.", "Moving to Slide 4, as you are aware, we successfully completed our capital plan initiatives, thereby complying with the new Tier One common equity rule. We generated $2.3 billion of capital, or 106% of the $2.2 billion target established by the Federal Reserve under the supervisory capital assessment program, or SCAP.", "Our capital raising transactions raised Tier One common by $2.1 billion which included $1.8 billion of common equity issuance. At this time, we've completed all anticipated capital initiatives and believe that additional capital cushion will be created through a combination of lower losses and higher earnings than projected in SCAP.", "I'll take a brief moment to comment on the common equity components of the plan before moving on. The week after the SCAP results announcements, we laid out a framework for our capital generation plans and it included an after market common stock offering as well as the potential for internal actions, and a preferred for common exchange.", "During the 10 days that followed the announcement, we finalized our capital plans and raised $258 million net in capital via the at the market sale of 17.7 million shares at an average price of $14.58. During this time, we obtained approval to execute a cash tender for the preferred in lieu of the tender for common previously announced, conditioned on raising the cash in advance of the tender offer.", "We also received significant reverse inquiry for a market equity offering. The results of both of those matters and other matters of course, we decided to shift to a market offering of $1.4 billion on June 1. The transaction was exceedingly successful as evidenced by significant over subscription, price performance and the exercise by the underwriters within days of the offering.", "And while we're clearly disappointed that we had to raise common equity at arguably the nadir of a recession with near record low bank stock prices, we were quite pleased with the execution overall.", "Moving on to Slide 5 which illustrates our significant capital position, with or without TARP, the impact of the transactions I've just outlined on our capital position and our book value per share. During the quarter, our already strong regulatory capital position was enhanced. The collective impact of our capital initiatives was a net increase in Tier One common of 152 basis points to an estimated 7.35% and a Tier One ratio estimated to be 12.25%.", "Overall, the share count dilution reduced our book value per share by approximately $10.00 to $36.16 and our tangible common book ratio by $4.74 to $23.41.", "Moving to Slide 6, we are here showing our over capitalized status today and providing a review of December 2010 that utilizes government SCAP assumptions and the supposition of TARP preferred payment. In this illustration, we start by displaying our actual June 2009 capital levels and then show the future impact on our capital positions if the full two year SCAP more adverse scenario assumed earnings and charge offs are realized and TARP is repaid fully at the end of 2009.", "You'll note in this example, we've taken no credit for the lower than SCAP projected losses and higher than SCAP projection earnings that we recorded for the first half of the year. ", "The SCAP pro rata projected charge off number for the first half of 2009 was nearly $3 billion versus our actual charge offs of $1.4 billion and this illustrative example, we've added a favorable variance of nearly $1.6 billion back to the next six quarters, increasing the projection quarterly loss to more than $1.7 billion per quarter.", "A key point of this slide is that we can mathematically repay TARP and remain at or above well capitalized thresholds even under the SCAP more adverse scenario. Now we'll point here that given our successful capital generation, TARP preferred is now excess expensive and inefficient capital.", "However, the point is not that we intend or expect to repay in full by the end of this year, although we certainly would like to do that. Our current belief is that the regulators will require a capital buffer greater than displayed here before approving forward payment and we do not intend to issue further common equity purely to enable repayment.", "We do however, expect that lower than SCAP projection losses to create additional capital cushion and believe full repayment will be enabled and improved when it becomes more readily apparent to regulators that loss levels of SCAP projected magnitude will not be realized.", "Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'll conclude by reiterating that our balance of client focused execution, risk mitigation and the long term economic prospects of our markets, position us well to deliver steadily improving returns as we come out of this cycle.", "Our performance on the other side of this will be driven in large part by those initiatives which are centered on growing revenue, improving expense efficiency, increasing the profitability of the balance sheet, investing for the future and prudently managing credit. ", "The SunTrust team is in the market place every day capitalizing on growth opportunities by serving existing clients well, by attracting new ones and by doing all the things that make it possible to look beyond current pressures with a reasoned and realistic sense of confidence. We are encouraged by the strong foundation we are creating and the underlying progress reflected in the first half of this year.", "And now I'll turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Chancy", "I'll begin my comments today on Slide 7 of the earnings presentation, the summary income statement. For the quarter we posted a loss to common shareholders of $164 million or $0.41 per share and a loss of $2.77 per share year to date, or $0.86 per share excluding the impact of the first quarter good will charge.", "Our financial results continue to be dominated by asset quality, credit and other pro cyclical expenses and to a lesser extent, soft revenue generation. While we are by no means pleased with these results, the core earnings of the organization improved in several areas versus the first quarter.", "For example, margin and net interest income increased. Provision expense decreased. Expenses declined and higher capital markets revenue partially offset a decline in mortgage production income. I will cover each of these areas in more detail in just a minute.", "There were also a number of special items in the quarter that warrant review, both pluses and minuses. I'll discuss the more significant of these during this morning's call and we have provided details in the appendix of the presentation.", "Now, I'll shift to Slide 8 and the balance sheet summary. Overall, average loan balances depicted on this slide declined 2% and 3% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. Total loans as reported in the tables accompanying the press release declined roughly 1% for both periods. The difference is that non performing loans have been excluded from this slide.", "Our aggressive effort to reduce exposure to construction lending is evident from the 13% balance decline versus last quarter and 44% decline compared to last year. Most other loan categories display small declines primarily driven by sluggish demand from credit worth commercial and consumer borrowers.", "Commercial real estate is an exception as many of the completed commercial construction projects migrate out of construction and into many term loans. This migration does not concern us as it is part of the normalized cycle of such projects. We typically underwrite commercial constructions projects to our portfolio credit standards that are more stringent that historic CMBS guidelines and the majority of the migration into commercial real estate is owner occupied.", "While still showing year over year growth, commercial loans declined again in the second quarter. This continued the trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid size and larger corporate clients due to improved access to capital markets and lower working capital needs.", "However loan balances were augmented in the first quarter by over $1 billion due to disruption in the variable rate demand note market. We believe this situation is temporary and will therefore cause some additional downward pressure on loan balances for the next two quarters.", "Now moving on to deposits where the opposite trend is occurring as we are very pleased as Jim mentioned with both the pace of growth and the continued improvement in deposit mix. Average consumer and commercial deposits increased 6% relative to the first quarter of 2009 and are up 12% versus the second quarter of last year. All products showed some growth the demand deposits leading the way at 8% sequential quarter growth.", "Now, I'm going to elaborate on quarter deposit growth on the next slide, so the final point here is that the growth in client related deposits has enabled us to further reduce brokered and foreign deposits where balances are down over $8 billion or 56% compared to the same quarter last year.", "Moving to Slide 9 and some detail on deposit trends, during last quarter's call we noted significant deposit growth started late in the fourth quarter and accelerated during the first quarter. You can clearly this on the slide, but the trend continued during the second quarter, albeit at a somewhat slower pace.", "Average monthly core deposit balances increased 6.7% from December to March and 10% from December to June with the June monthly average hitting a new record $114 billion. In particular, demand deposits have increased the most rapidly, up over 19% from December to June. ", "Another item to note here is that due to our increased liquidity, we have allowed CD balances to decline over the past three months. We readily acknowledge that a portion of the core deposit growth is related to industry wide flight to safety, seasonality and reduced client demand for sweep accounts due to the low rate requirement.", "However, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to believe that we are also benefiting from a number of actions taken to improve market place awareness and client service. The Live Solid, Bank Solid branding campaign for example, continues to be very well received and we believe it is helping drive client acquisition. We also continue to refine pricing tactics to be not only competitive but also to maintain deposit rates that are attractive to our clients. ", "As Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, we have been intensely focused on improving execution and operational excellence. We are streamlining account opening process, reducing error rates, increasing training and employing many other tactics that are improving client experience and satisfaction, and resulting in an increased client acquisition and retention rates.", "All that being said, deposit growth did moderate somewhat in the second quarter. As we look forward, our expectation is that growth will moderate further and possibly be flat to down as the macro economy changes. An improving economy, increasing short term interest rates and continued deposit pricing, particularly in CD pricing, will likely create a lower growth environment.", "However, increased core deposits, an improved overall mix and a continued focus on execution has created a solid foundation to drive margin and earnings in future periods.", "Now with all that said, let me take a minute to talk about margin on Slide 10. Margin reversed course this quarter, expanding 7 basis points to 2.94%. Lower deposit pricing and improved funding mix drover the expansion with increased core deposits facilitating a reduction as I mentioned a minute ago and higher cost deposits and long term debt.", "Our view of the risks and opportunities to margin in the third and fourth quarter is largely unchanged from last quarter. Loan and deposit pricing and deposit volume are the primary opportunities to generate additional margin expansion while the primary risks continue to relate to an expectation that MPA's will continue to rise and loan demand will be sluggish.", "Netting the pluses and minuses, our guidance on future net interest margin is also largely unchanged from last quarter. We believe margin will remain relatively stable in the short run and are optimistic that some additional expansion is possible during the remainder of the year.", "Now moving to Slide 11 and provision expense, Tom will cover credit in detail in a moment, so I'll be brief here. Total provision expense for the quarter was $962 million, down $32 million from the first quarter. Net charge offs increased to $801 million, up 31% from the first quarter level to 2.59% of loans.", "However, in our last earnings call, we noted that a classification change to report mortgage related borrower misrepresentations as charge offs, were expected to increase charge offs versus the first quarter by approximately $100 million. The actual increase was about $99 million and for comparative purposes, charge offs increased $92 million or 15% excluding this classification change.", "Provision of $161 million was recorded in excess of net charge offs in the quarter to build the loan loss reserve to 2.37% of loans. Excess provision to build the reserve is down $223 million compared to last quarter and it is down $50 million excluding the first quarter increase in reserves related to the classification change that I just mentioned as it relates to borrower misrepresentation and that dollar amount was $173 million during the first quarter. ", "Now moving on to non interest income on Slide 12, reported non interest income growth in the quarter was down 5% and 24% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. However, after adjustments for a number of items in each quarter, non interest income declined 10% and 3% respectively.", "We've provided detail underlying our non interest income adjustments in the appendix of today's presentation, and the largest adjustments of the second quarter results with $112 million gain from the sale of our Visa shares, a $96 million write down on our fair value debt and related hedges, and $157 million recovery of impairment on mortgage servicing rights carried at lower cost of market.", "As you may remember, the low MSR asset is primarily hedged using mortgage backed securities held as available for sale. This approach to hedging worked well in the fourth quarter of 2008 as we recognized gains from the sale of securities sufficient to offset the impairment of the asset. During the second quarter, we recognized approximately $20 million in losses on sales of securities designated for hedging the low comp MSR asset.", "Now the short answer for why we did not recognize greater securities losses against the impairment recovery, is that the hedge portfolio significantly outperformed the MSR asset, and we didn't have any material losses remaining in the mortgage backed securities portfolio to realize. At quarter end, securities we designated to hedge the assets had unrealized losses of effectively zero and the total agency NBS portfolio ended the quarter with a small net unrealized gain.", "Outside of these adjustments, we had a solid quarter of non interest income generation, particularly revenue from capital markets activities included in investment banking fees and trading income, was particularly notable with a record level of revenue generated in our corporate and investment banking segment.", "Performance in most other non interest income categories was acceptable with stable to higher revenues versus the first quarter reported in service charges, trust income and card fees.", "Mortgage production income for the second quarter remained very strong at $165 million, but it does warrant some additional discussion given that it declined versus the first quarter. The first thing to note is that the majority of revenue derived from originating a mortgage is recognized when clients lock in their rate, not when the loan is closed.", "This means that production income will precede reported mortgage originations about 30 to 60 days, so while our reported closed loan production volume increased 24% versus last quarter, the volume of locked loans in the second quarter actually decreased over 10%. Additionally, mortgage production margins declined by roughly 20% versus the historically high level in the first quarter, and mortgage repurchase reserves increased by $36 million. ", "Overall, we're reasonably satisfied with the non interest income given the solid quarter posted in our capital markets business, the increase in mortgage servicing related revenue, partially offsetting the decline in production income and the performance in certain other areas.", "Now let me turn to non interest expenses on Slide 13. On a reported basis, non interest expense increased 11% compared to the second quarter of 2008 but declined 29% in the first quarter of 2009. On this slide we have adjusted out good will and intangible write offs the FDIC special assessment and debt extinguishment gains and losses which are detailed in the appendix.", "Excluding these items, expenses are up 6% compared to last year and down 2% compared to the first quarter. However, there are a number of items impacting these adjusted numbers that warrant additional explanation. ", "We provided the underlying drivers for the majority of the changes, so let me walk you through the schedule. The total year over year increase in adjusted expenses is $83 million. As you can see, the sum of the four lines below the $83 million is $134 million. What this means is that more than all of the increase over 160% in fact, was driven by credit costs, higher FDIC premiums, even excluding the special assessment, and pension costs.", "Said another way, this means that the net of all remaining expenses declined over $50 million or 3.8% year over year. For the sequential quarter decline in expenses, the same items listed explain nearly all the decline, meaning that all other expenses together were unchanged from last quarter.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Tom Freeman to review our asset quality results.", "Tom Freeman", "This morning I'm going to provide a review of our asset quality. I'll being on Slide 14 with a brief review of the credit losses projected by the government under the most adverse scenario SCAP.", "SunTrust absolutely lost rates under the government's stress test scenario. We're projected to be at the lower end of the banks in the studies. We believe that our mix of products, more stable geographies excepting Florida and conservative underwriting are the reasons for the difference.", "We believe the estimate is high as compared to our own scenario analysis, even under the more adverse economic scenario. To help illustrate the conservative nature of the government estimates, I will point out that the overall result was two year cumulative charge offs of $11.8 billion. Our first half 2009 actual charge offs were $1.4 billion.", "In order to recognize the remaining SCAP estimate of $10.4 billion over the next six quarters, charge offs would have to increase to over $1.7 billion in each of the next six quarters. This amount is more than two times our second quarter charge off level of $800 million and while I suppose that level of charge offs is possible, it certainly doesn't seem likely to us at this time.", "Turning to Slide 15, and the SCAP loss estimate by portfolio, the data on this slide provides further evidence of the conservative nature of our portfolio with no sub prime or option arms, a small credit card portfolio, only about $500 million in true consumer cards, and low levels of unsecured consumer and small business loans. In each category, you can see that the government's loss estimates for SunTrust are in the middle to low end of the range. ", "Please turn to Slide 16, where I will provide a summary of our current asset quality metrics. Charge offs and non performing loans increased in the quarter. There were some positive signs in certain portfolio segments that I'll discuss in a moment. For now, please note the decline in early stage delinquency that you will see in more detail in subsequent slides.", "Charge offs increased to $801 million, up $191 million from last quarter. During last quarter's call, we projected $100 million increase in charge offs related to the classification change from operating to credit losses, for losses due to borrower misrepresentation. And in fact, this increase was $99 million.", "Excluding this amount, charge offs increased $92 million primarily in the residential mortgage and home equity line portfolios. Non performing assets increased $919 million during the quarter, or $6.2 billion or 5% of loans, and other repossessed assets. The rate of change in NPA's in the quarter of 18% is similar to the change last quarter. The growth was largely comprised of residential mortgages, home builders and a few larger C&I loans. ", "We added $161 million to the allowance in the second quarter which raised our reserve to loans coverage ratio 16 basis points to 237 basis points. The slower growth in reserve as compared to the last two quarters is largely due to future quarters consumer related charge off projections. The clearest evidence of this is the continued improvement in early state delinquencies.", "Asset quality issues were primarily found in the residential real estate portfolios. This includes residential mortgages, home equity products, residential construction and construction to firm. The small decrease we noted in early state delinquency during the first quarter trended down further during the second quarter. ", "The downward trend was broad based, occurring in most of the portfolios. Particularly notable are home equities and residential mortgages where early stage delinquencies decline meaningfully for the second straight quarter.", "Commercial charge offs increased again in the second quarter. We are seeing some increased stress in our C&I portfolio which is still most evident in the more cyclically sensitive industries. Despite the difficult economic environment, the portfolio continues to perform reasonably well with early stage delinquencies also declining again in the quarter.", "The composition of the charge offs similar to last quarter, is primarily in the small business area and a hand full of larger loans to clients primarily engaged in more cyclical industries. Given the increase in MPL's this quarter, and the nature of these credits, we expect overall C&I charge offs to increase in the third quarter. As a side note, shared national credits represent less than one fourth of $38 billion C&I portfolio.", "Our commercial portfolio is well diversified by industry and geography, which we expect will help balance a negative impact from weaker industries. The commercial real estate portfolio also continues to perform reasonably well overall. While we did see some increase in early stage delinquencies, we are not experiencing any material deterioration in the portfolio at this time. The majority of this portfolio is secured by owner occupied properties which continue to positively impact credit performance. ", "Charge offs in the consumer direct portfolio returned to fourth quarter levels after a seasonal decline in the first quarter. However, early stage delinquencies declined by a full percentage point. ", "The indirect portfolio, which is largely indirect auto loans, performed very well in the second quarter. The charge off rate of 124 basis points is the lowest quarterly loss rate since the fourth quarter of 2007. We believe this portfolio is benefiting from lower fuel prices, stabilized used car values and the natural turnover of the book into newly underwritten vintages.", "Consumer real estate and construction related charge off rates increased in the second quarter. However, a noted a moment ago, all of these portfolios showed meaningful declines in early stage delinquencies.", "Next I will cover the residential mortgage portfolio on Slide 18. There are three important messages to take away from this slide. First, balances declined in all products except the core portfolio and they declined significantly in home equity loans, prime seconds and lot loans.", "The second take away is that the delinquencies improved for all products on the slide with the exception of lot loans and Altay seconds. For both of the exceptions, the actual count of loans in dollars delinquent declined, and the higher ratio results from lower product outstandings. The denominator is shrinking faster than the numerator which is what one would expect in run off portfolios.", "We are pleased with the improvement of delinquencies in the portfolios that make up the bulk of our residential mortgage loans, but given the instability in the market place, we are unwilling to call this a sustainable trend.", "The third point is that non accrual loans trended higher. This increase in non accruals and the increased charge offs that I mentioned on the previous slide, reflect the results of the increased delinquencies that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008. The trend higher for residential mortgage MPL's also reflects our presence in Florida.", "As a reminder, Florida is a judicial foreclosure state and as a result of this, and high volumes in the Florida court system, we are experiencing extended time frames of more than 12 months from filing to foreclosure.", "In summary, while we are pleased with the decline in residential mortgage delinquency, higher non accruals and lower home values will continue to drive elevated losses over the near term.", "Now let's talk about home equity lines on Slide 19. Home equity credit performance is for the most part driven by the high risk segments in the portfolio. Lines originated by third parties and lines in Florida exceeding 80% combined loan to value. These two segments account for just 23% of our HELOC balances which underwrite 55% of our second quarter charge offs.", "From a future risk management perspective, there is virtually no line availability remaining on these two high risk segments or in the portfolio of non Florida equity lines over 90% combined loan to value.", "Two thirds of the HELOC portfolio, or $11 billion is exhibiting better although not acceptable performance. First, charge offs increased to 2.35% of loans this quarter which reflects the results of increased non accruals in prior quarters. Second, while non accruals increased in prior quarters, driving the higher charge offs this quarter, non accruals leveled out in the second quarter as compared to the first.", "Although past due's were not reference on the slide, I will point out that the consumer delinquency improvement I've already noted for residential mortgages also extends to the HELOC portfolio. This quarter we saw significant improvement in all early delinquency buckets up to an including 90 to 119 days past due and the positive trends appear to be continuing in July.", "Now if you turn to Slide 20, I'll talk about our construction portfolio. As expected, and continuing a multi quarter trend, constructions outstandings declined significantly in the second quarter and now stand at just over $8 billion. Balances dropped nearly 10% this quarter and construction loans now comprise less than 7% of total loans.", "The annualized net charge off ratio increased to 4.2% driven by the drop in outstandings as dollar net charge offs remained fairly stable. However, 30 plus delinquencies declined meaningfully in most portfolio segments.", "Construction to firm loans continued to decline and the portfolios are stabilizing. Compared to the first quarter, balances, delinquency and the charge off ratio all decreased while the level of non performers remained stable. ", "Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains solid overall. Charge offs declined in the quarter and a small number of projects comprised the bulk of the non performing loans. While the total non performing balances remains small, you can see that most are in Florida.", "The residential portion of the portfolio continues to be the most problematic. Early stage delinquencies are down from first quarter; however, charge offs have increased in the construction and land categories, in particular, as more problem loans get through the work out process. ", "We believe we will continue to see elevated charge offs in the residential construction portfolio as we continue to work out process with the builders. 42% of the residential construction MPL's are in Florida where the judicial foreclosure process is extended as compared to the rest of our markets.", "Please turn to Slide 21 for a review of allowance of non performing loans. We have discussed in previous calls that our reserve methodology is fundamentally focused on estimating incurred losses across all portfolios and not non performing loans. Each quarter, we also provide a slide highlighting a portion of our residential mortgage non accruals that have been written down to expected recoverable value.", "As a reminder, we write down residential mortgages at 180 days past due to current market value less a 15% hair cut to arrive at the expected recoverable value. This slide is new this quarter and incorporates the analysis of residential mortgage MPL's into a framework that includes our FAS114 reserves.", "FAS114 reserves are loan loss reserves established on a loan by loan basis for larger loans that are deemed to be impaired. The result of this analysis is that our allowance coverage of non performing loans, increases from 54% to nearly 100% when you factor the impact of mortgages that have been written down and loans with specific reserves. Tables on the FAS114 reserves by business is also included on the slide.", "For each of the businesses, we have provided the balance of the loans with specific reserves, the amount of reserves carried against those balances and the charge offs that have already been taken against those same loans.", "The result in the far right column is the implied loss severity for those specific loans which averages 34%. The lowest loss severity displayed is for our commercial business at 25%. These are typically secured loans to mid sized businesses and real estate developers.", "The highest implied loss severity is from our corporate and investment banking business segment and is a weighted average of 62%. The simple average severity for this segment would be 47%. The implied severity on these loans is influenced upward by two factors.", "The first is that we have fewer large impaired credits in this business so the FAS114 reserves and applied severities can be very lumpy. The second, is that the specific credit included in the FAS114 reserves at this time are cyclical industries and the loss severities are being driven upward by expected debt for equities swap work downs.", "Let me summarize today's credit discussion before turning the call over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 22.", "Overall, the basic credit themes we talked about last quarter remained in quarter in the second quarter. Credit performance weakened with the deterioration most evident in residential real estate related charge offs and MPL growth. ", "In the second quarter the decline in early stage delinquencies were significant and broad based, particularly in consumer and mortgage loan products. We are seeing some weakening in the C&I book, notably in industry sectors most impacted by the residential construction decline, and by reductions in consumer spending. But overall, the C&I portfolio is well diversified and performance is in line with our expectations given the recessionary environment.", "Residential mortgage delinquencies and balances and certain larger and higher risk portfolios declined meaningfully while non accrual balances trended higher in the portfolio. Less than a quarter of the home equity portfolio continued to drive more than half the charge offs.", "The two-thirds of the portfolio that is of better quality, exhibited higher charge offs and stable non accruals. The construction portfolio continued to track as balance declined. Performance of the construction product has stabilized. Residential construction remained weak and commercial construction continued to perform well.", "We believe credit loss and non performing loans will increase in the third quarter given our expectation for weakness in the residential real estate related and cyclically sensitive commercial exposures.", "Delinquency trends, particularly in consumer are encouraging relative to the potential loss rates in the fourth quarter and beyond while we are still anxious as to the direction of the economy.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Shriner", "We will begin taking questions in just a moment. First, in order to accommodate as many questions as possible, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up please. Operator, we're ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I can appreciate there's a lot of moving pieces in the loan loss reserves in terms of what the real actual level should be and from the details on the write downs in the mortgage book are helpful here, but just in general when I step back and I look at the reserves, the charge off, the reserve MPA's on a different metric, it still seems lower than I would have thought at this point in the cycle, especially given your view that MPA's and charge offs are still going to rise from here. Maybe just give a little more color on how you think the reserve build will trend from here whether you expect it will be more going forward than we've seen thus far.", "", "Tom Freeman", "Our thought of the reserve build, the reserve build will be dictated in large part by what we see happening within I think the consumer part of the portfolio. If in fact that portfolio continues to stabilize, then the reserve build will slow.", "We see early signs of stabilization in terms of movement into delinquencies and therefore subsequent quarter's movement into non performing loans and therefore the charge offs. If in fact that trend happens the way we expect it to, I think you'll see the need for reserve build to begin to mitigate.", "James Wells", "One of the things we try to do is provide the severity data by the various categories in terms of what losses we're actually realizing. We provide the information in the mortgage section. There's a chart that talks about severities and a lot of the growth in non performing loans at this point in the residential area is in the traditional core product as opposed to for example, Altay versus seconds which largely burn themselves out.", "And we're providing you loss severity information in there that's 20% to 30%. We provided you the FAS114 loss severity data. Tom mentioned there's some lumpiness as it relates to CIB but those numbers range in the 30% to 50%, so when you compare the coverage ratio that we noted after adjustment for the mortgage write downs and the FAS114's, you get a feel for coverage relative to the loss severities which as you know is the aspect for the reserve. Not just non performing coverage, but coverage of the expected losses on those non performers and those that we have already incurred a loss but haven't yet determined to be non performing.", "That's a least more data for you to chew on as it relates to getting comfortable with our current position.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I can see the comments related to the consumer side makes sense to me and we are seeing the early DQ's turning down here, but what about on the commercial side? It feels like we're just kind of in a cycle for C&I for commercial real estate outside of construction. None of us really know how painful it will be.", "Obviously you're MPA's are off a lot on a small base. Maybe you can give some color of how much reserve you have against the commercial books in general and why you're confident you won't have to build a lot there.", "James Wells", "The way we build, first of all, I think we've gone back over in a lot of detail with our commercial real estate folks, the income, the non construction part of the portfolio. We've gone back over the individual credits. We are again doing a deep dive into all of the income producing credits. We try to make sure our assumptions and the statistics we've got here are correct and we have a detailed understanding of the value of the assets that we're financing and their cash flow generation capability.", "We saw a minor increase in delinquencies. We tracked those back to which segments of the portfolio they were coming out of and have gone back and looked real hard at that portfolio and while we're deeply concerned about what could potentially be going in in the overall commercial real estate industry, that seems to be centered much more in large projects and large commercial real estate development activity.", "Our portfolio is primarily smaller, regional real estate offerings with about 60% of the portfolio being lent to people who are doing owner occupied properties. We're seeing stability in that part of the portfolio so we're watching it carefully, but don't see signs of massive movement or massive problem in that portfolio at the moment.", "On the C&I side, what we're seeing is the cyclical industries that we identified probably two to three quarters ago, lots of this being media oriented, have worked through the work out cycle and are getting charge offs this quarter and next quarter.", "And we're seeing construction related industries showing some weakness and increase in delinquency, but general stabilization in the remainder of the C&I portfolio; some minor weakness but the remaining portfolio segments are doing okay.", "Mark Chancy", "Just one additional point, we certainly don't agree with all of the aspects of the SCAP process, but one thing that we do agree on relative to our peers, it did not surprise us that the expected C&I cumulative losses over the two year period was at the best in class level. So while that's not directly answering your question because that's under a more adverse than expected scenario and there's a lot of variables, it at least gives you a view of the third parties of our C&I book under a stress scenario.", "Matthew O'Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Do you disclose the reserves allocated to the C&I book or the income book?", "James Wells", "We do in the K. On an annual basis, there are segments of the allowance, probably not necessarily at the level of granularity that you're asking for, but in a couple of different levels that you can review.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research]", "[Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research]", "Could you just clarify you commentary about exiting TARP by year end 2009. You said that, you showed us the impact if you did exit at year end, but I gather from the rest of you comments that you do not expect to. Can you clarify that a bit? And if you don't exit TARP by year end 2009, do you see any practical impact on company fundamentals?", "James Wells", "The purpose of the illustration was to show that at the end of '09, we were at a base well capitalized levels in both Tier One and Tier One common. The rules keep changing as I said several times, and we don't quite know where the rules will go or when they go where they go. ", "I also said as you noted, that I didn't anticipate, we weren't expecting to do that, but that we would like to. I think at this point, that's about all we know about what the rules may be and who will do what soon. Having said that, the TARP is a negative in my view, although not a great one in terms of all the things that our friends in Washington are trying to control and manage in detail from there.", "Some of the other things that our friends in Washington are doing are much more troublesome I might add than TARP. So we tried to give you a sense of where our capital position was even given the SCAP severities and the SCAP PP&R view, but I'm not predicting at this point when TARP repayment will occur.", "[Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research]", "On the core ingredients of net interest margin, could you just speak to deposit pricing and loan pricing at this point and why you expect stability in the NIM?", "Mark Chancy", "We talked at the first quarter about the fact that with the sharp decline in interest rate at the end of the year, LIBOR based loans reset immediately as we entered 2009 and the deposit rates reset during the course of the quarter, and coupled with several other anomalies in the LIBOR market place, caused a significant drop in margin.", "We had expected that the liabilities would be re-pricing throughout the quarter which would provide some positive benefits to margin. That's clearly what we saw. You look at the various interest bearing deposit rates, money market, CD's, they did re-price.", "We also got substantial growth during the second quarter as it relates to the non interest bearing, the core low cost deposits, particularly demand deposits which is where the result of all the effort of the focus we have internally on deposit generation.", "So the combination of those two elements really were the core drivers of margin improvement. We are going through an additional period where we'll re-price certain client CD's through the course of the third and the fourth quarter, a significant change in rates. As you know, year over year that will provide some additional positive.", "While we have noted the moderation in deposit growth, we certainly aren't slowing down our efforts to further penetrate our geography and our client base, so our hope is to continue to drive deposits which will further enhance the margin. We do note that there are a couple of headwinds that relate to growing non performing assets and sluggish loan demand, so when you weigh those counter balance factors, we still believe that margin is likely to be relatively stable with some upside potential over the course of the next couple of quarters.", "[Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research]", "Loan pricing, is there any competition for loans at this point or has everybody just sort of stepped back?", "Mark Chancy", "We've had an intense effort over the past year focusing on making sure that we are pricing the various loan categories both competitively and appropriately on a risk adjusted basis. We are seeing improvement in both our process and the results which is providing lift to the loan book as we are putting on a good loan spread in the way in which we look at risk adjusted return across a number of asset categories.", "So there is a significant amount of focus there. In aggregate, loan demand as we noted earlier is down for those credit worthy borrowers on a year over year basis, and so while we're getting lift in the book if you will, the fact that earning assets at least on the loan side are not growing robustly. ", "You're not seeing that today translate into significant growth in net interest income, but I would tell you that all of the process, the focus and intensity within the company is certainly thee not only on the deposit side, but on the loan side as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Craig Seigenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse]", "[Craig Seigenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse]", "Just a follow up on Matt's question about the reserve, and maybe thinking about it a different way, and I do appreciate the disclosure on Slide 21, but one point, if reserve coverage to annualize net charge offs declines to 1.9 years to 1.1 years which is last quarter, doesn't this imply the net charge offs will probably decline over the next few quarters just to justify the lighter reserve coverage?", "James Wells", "Since we're not forecasting and don't forecast what our charge off levels are going to be, I'm not exactly sure how to answer your question thoughtfully. I would however point you back to our guidance around the falling early stage delinquencies over the past couple of quarters.", "What we look at is the aberration in the fourth quarter of the increase in delinquencies, we think driven primarily by election rhetoric at that point in time with the consumer, and if delinquencies keep coming down, it stages out three quarters later. The more delinquencies fall, the more charge offs and non performers will fall during that period of time. That's not a direct answer, but about the best I can do for you.", "[Craig Seigenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse]", "Is there any reason why you think that metric may not be a fair judge of your loan book and your loss case versus other metrics.", "James Wells", "I'm sorry, which metric?", "[Craig Seigenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse]", "The reserve to net charge offs.", "James Wells", "The reserves is a forward-looking expectation of losses and not a backward looking expectation, so what it does is it is based upon loss content within the portfolios going forward and not necessarily a coverage looking backwards.", "Mark Chancy", "The other thing to note here is, in a given quarter when you annualize charge offs, you're going to get a level that may not be representative of run rate over the forward-looking 12 months. And so when you're comparing in on an adequacy basis to the aggregate reserve, you have to take into consideration that one quarter's results which for us could be lumpy for example as it relates to how CIB charge offs come through, and what the expectation which is embedded in the reserve process over the forward-looking 12 month period.", "As you get towards just generically, as you get towards the peak in the charge off cycle, the phenomenon that you just described is exactly what you would expect because the reserve won't move hopefully in this cycle immediately down as it relates to the recession ending and credit improving. You're going to have a period where a quarterly charge off number and the reserve should be in keeping with one another on a one to one basis.", "So I want to make sure as you look at the quarter numbers as opposed to the full year forecast, which we're not providing in this discussion, just a generic comment about the fact that this is a trend that you ought to see as we're reaching a point in the cycle where we're starting to peak in charge offs.", "[Craig Seigenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse]", "How do you think we should view the sustainability of the really strong earnings you're getting in your investment banking and also your mortgage banking operation right now relative to maybe a second quarter or even a run rate next year?", "James Wells", "We have a number of units within the corporate investment banking division that are performing very well. The business as you know, does have cyclicality to it, but I would say that a lot of this business is core, that we believe there have been opportunities for us to gain market share as a result of some of the disruption that's taken place in the industry over the last year to year and a half.", "We've been making investment in selected sectors that are paying dividends for us. We think we're well positioned as a franchise to offer a broad array of products and services at a very high quality level to our clients, and as a result this is an area as we look out over the course of the next year where we have high expectations for, maybe not continued record level each quarter, but very strong performance in a number of areas within CIB.", "Now, with all that said, we're also seeing rising non performing loans in the larger corporate segment which is overall a negative to the earnings stream of that division. You can see that in the quarterly tables, so while we had record revenues during the quarter, we also had a significant increase in charge offs, and Tom talked about our expectation in certain cyclical industries where we are expecting an increasing trend in non performers here in the short run.", "So I don't want to just, we're talking about revenue. We're also looking at profitability during the course of the year and profitability will certainly be under pressure in that division as a result of an expectation of growing non performers and likely charge offs.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup.", "Greg Ketron \u2013 Citigroup", "Back to the commercial non performing loan build, that increased over $300 million from last quarter, we've heard a couple of other banks talk about the shared national credit review being somewhat influential in terms of MPL build, and I was wondering if that may have had some influence over the increase. As I look at that, and look at Slide 21 in the deck, which by the way I really appreciate that being provided now, when you look at commercial investment banking and in commercial look at the implied severity and then look at the amount of commercial non accrual loans in expected severity, what kind of color could you provide around that in terms of expectations?", "James Wells", "Let's start with the shared national credit. As you know, we are required to do our own rating, our own evaluation and our own controls around all of the credits whether they're shared credits or not. I will tell you that our results in the second quarter reflected any knowledge we had of any regulatory action at any of the banks that were agenting the credits.", "So we don't expect that this will be third quarter event. We've adjusted for everything we know as well as I believe our credit process conforms pretty well to what we saw the results coming out of the shared credit so we don't wait for the regulators to push us on our loan grades or our performing/non performing characteristics.", "The second part of it is, I believe the loss severity you see in the charts we provided on that slide are indicative of a couple of very large charge offs in terms of loss severity having to do with the media industry where in fact the losses coming out of the media side are much more robust than we would have expected and has a lot to do with the debt for equity swap versus debt restructuring that would have traditionally gone on there.", "We in our modeling expect some place in the 45% to 55% range severity for those types of C&I credits.", "Thank you everybody.

(NYSE:STI) Q3 2009 Earnings Call October 22, 2009  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Steve Shriner - Director of IR", "Jim Wells - CEO ", "Mark Chancy - CFO", "Tom Freeman - Chief Risk Officer", "Bill Rogers - President", "Analysts", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Jefferson Harralson - KBW", "Terry McEvoy - Oppenheimer", "Bob Patton - Morgan Keegan", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Operator", "Welcome to SunTrust third quarter Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I'd like to introduce your first speaker, Mr. Steve Shriner, the Director of Investor Relations.", "Steve Shriner", "Welcome to SunTrust third quarter earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. Slide two outlines the content, which covers an overview of the quarter, financial results discussion and an in-depth credit review. Press release, presentation and financial schedules are available on our website. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section. ", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter, Mark will then discuss financial performance, and Tom will conclude with an in-depth review of asset quality. At the conclusion of the formal remarks, we'll open the session for questions.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings which are available on the website. Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the statements are made and we disclaim any responsibility to do so. During the call, we'll discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP measures in our press release and on our website.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website which is www.suntrust.com.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.", "Jim Wells", "Thanks for being with us this morning. The results we are going to discuss this morning continue to reflect the difficult operating environment faced by more traditional banks. Continued recession related earnings pressures, including higher credit costs and write downs, softer fee income and generally weak loan demand culminated in the $0.76 per share loss we reported this morning. I will point out that $0.16 of the per share loss is related to changes in the market valuation of SunTrust\u2019s public debt as credit spreads narrowed, reflecting an improved [view] of SunTrust\u2019s credit quality.", "We are not happy to report a loss, but much like last quarter, there is more in our earnings story. We are encouraged by some core business trends that have recently emerged as we look toward the prospect of an improving economy.", "Specifically, an expanded net interest margin, lower core operating expenses and importantly a decline in nonperforming loans and stable early stage loan delinquency levels, all give us reasons to be tentatively optimistic about the direction the operating environment is headed and what that might mean for our markets, for our borrowers and for our businesses. As is typical in a recession overall revenue remains soft with stable net interest income and lower noninterest income. Net interest income was stable as net interest margin expanded due to a significant increase in client deposits as well as an improved mix that enabled a reduction in higher cost sources of funding.", "Loans and earning assets declined more rapidly than in previous quarters, offsetting the benefit of the higher margin. What we are seeing is the sustained economic weakness has reduced the demand for loans as many clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction and many have also accessed the debt markets.", "Additionally, overall fee revenue was soft, reduced consume spending was evident in the decline in many fee-related sources of income, although investment banking income increased due to higher capital markets activity.", "The result of disciplined expense management was evident across controllable operating expenses again this quarter. We continue to capitalize on the strength we have built in this area as we remained focused on continually uncovering efficiency improvement opportunities. However, post cyclical costs including mortgage and reinsurance reserves, other real estate, FDIC pension cost, unfunded commitment reserves and credit and collection costs all remained high.", "On the asset quality front, provision expense increased 18% due to high credit losses. On the other hand, we are pleased that early stage delinquency and nonperforming loans were stable. However, for the time being, we expect credit losses to remain elevated. What it comes down to is that we are encouraged by some positive core business trends that are emerging in these signs of an improving economy. At the same time, we remain responsibly cautious in our optimism. In our view, it would be premature to declare a broad victory over recessionary pressures or to start talking about turning corners about hitting a bottom and the like.", "The environment remains very challenging and our approach to our business remains prudent, conservative and balanced. We recognized that the beginning of a recovery is just that, it's a beginning, and history tells us that looking over the longer term, it will take time before economic stabilization meaningfully translates into bottom-line results for traditional balance sheet. Asset quality, revenues and ultimately earnings improvement will need time to gain traction and the timing will be largely dependent upon the pace and the strength of the recovery, both of which remain as open questions.", "While the nature and timing of economic recovery is an open question, we are confident that our actions to bolster capital, liquidity and reserves leaves us with substantial resources that we expect will allow us to successfully manage through sustained economic weakness if that in fact occurs.", "Meanwhile, looking to the balance of 2009 and 2010, we are acutely focused on the client on improving service quality and frontline execution, while controlling expenses and managing risks. I believe we are doing a good job here controlling what we can control, and taking advantage of the opportunities that are out there, even in the current environment. The positive results of our efforts are reflected in various aspects of our core performance over the last few quarters. Our continued success in these areas will permit us to deliver steadily improving results as the operating environment improves. ", "Turning to slide four, I\u2019d like to spend a moment discussing our capital position, before turning the call over to Mark. Slide four illustrates our significant capital position with or without TARP, and our book value per share. ", "We maintain a solid capital with an estimated tier one common ratio of 7.45%, and a tier one ratio of 12.55. Box value and tangible common equity remained relatively stable this quarter. ", "Given our current capital and liquidity, we are well positioned to repay TARP when regulatory approval is received. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'll conclude by emphasizing a point that I have been making for several quarters that remains both valid and timely in light of our third quarter results. ", "SunTrust is well positioned to deliver steadily improving returns, as we move beyond this cycle. Our long term focus is centered on growing revenue, improving expenses efficiency, increasing the profitability of our balance sheet, investing for the future, and prudently managing credit. ", "Our strong foundation coupled with our client focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities and the long-term economic prospects of our markets all augers well for the future. The SunTrust team is focused on serving our clients and delivering the results that will ultimately translate into improved shareholder value, as we move beyond this cycle into a better operating environment. ", "I'll now turn the call over to Mark to provide details on the financials.", "Mark Chancy", "I'll begin my comments today on slide five of the earnings presentation, with the summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss in common shareholders of $377 million, or $0.76 per share. The reported results included $0.16 per share of market evaluation losses on our public debt, carried at fair value, as SunTrust debt spreads improved during the quarter. ", "On a year-to-date basis, the loss to common shareholders is $3.41 per share and $1.69 if you exclude the impact of goodwill impairment which was reported in the first quarter of 2009. ", "As Jim indicated, our financial results continue to be dominated by credit losses, per cyclical expenses and to a lesser extent soft revenue generation in certain units. While we are not satisfied with these results, there are some positive operating trends that I will point out. Margin and interest income increased, deposit mix continued to improve even as client deposit growth moderated and expenses declined. ", "On the other hand, recessionary pressures continued to weigh on loan volumes and non-interest income. I will cover each of these areas in more detail in just a minute. There were also a number of special items in the quarter. We have provided schedules in the presentation and the appendix to simplify the review, and I'll discuss some of the more significant items in my remarks this morning. ", "Now I'll shift to slide six and the balance sheet summary. Overall, as you can see, average loan balances excluding non-accruals declined 4% and 7%, as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. Our aggressive effort to reduce exposure to construction lending continued in the third quarter, as evidenced by the 16% decline in balances versus last quarter and the 48% decline compared to last year. ", "The majority of the overall decline in loans, though, came from the commercial loan category, which declined over $3 billion or 8% in the third quarter. This reduction continued the trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid-sized and larger corporate clients due to improved access to capital markets and lower working capital needs. ", "For example, our large corporate client line utilization has dropped from an average of 34% in the fourth quarter of last year, to approximately 25% during the month of September. Most other loan categories displayed small increases or declines, as demand from qualified commercial and consumer borrowers remained sluggish. ", "Moving onto the deposits at the bottom of the slide, where the opposite trend is occurring, as deposit volumes and mix continued to improve. The pace of growth and deposits moderated as expected, however average consumer and commercial deposits increased another 1% this quarter relative to last, and are now up 14% versus last year. ", "Please note that unlike last quarter, where all products showed some growth, this quarters\u2019 growth continued in transaction accounts, while average CD balances declined. We noted the beginning of this trend last quarter looking at monthly data, and we have continued to manage our CD pricing carefully, due to our increased liquidity position. ", "Similar to client related CDs, we further reduced, brokered and foreign deposits in the quarter, such as these shorter term and generally higher cost funds are now down over $10 billion or 67% compared to the same quarter last year. ", "In addition to refining and lowering the cost of our funding profile, our current liquidity situation enabled us to take certain actions which resulted in an increase in our securities portfolio. Please turn over to slide 7, I'll give you more detail. ", "The portfolio continues to be concentrated in high quality and very liquid securities. Government and agency securities in the first four rows comprised over 80% of the portfolio, and as a reminder, the other equity holdings are largely coke stock, Federal Reserve and federal home loan bank stock. ", "You will note that we increased our holdings of U.S. treasury and agency securities by over $4 billion in light of the increased liquidity that higher deposit and lower loan balances created. You can also see the agency mortgage-backed securities declined by roughly $2 billion. ", "This decline was related to sales later in the quarter, where we had the opportunity to manage the portfolios\u2019 duration by selling bonds at a gain and repositioning the mortgage-backed portfolio into securities that we believe have higher relative value. At this time, we have substantially completed a repurchase of similar securities, and we will continue to look for additional opportunities in the fourth quarter. ", "I'll now take a minute to cover the margin on slide eight. Margin expanded again this quarter, increasing by a better than expected 16 basis points to [3.10]. Lower deposit pricing and improved funding mix drove the expansion, with increased core deposits facilitating a reduction in higher cost deposits and long-term debt. ", "While we were expecting margin expansion, we were pleasantly surprised by the relative change in earning asset yields versus deposit rates, the continued shift and mix to lower cost deposit products and importantly, stabilization of nonperforming loans. ", "Our view of the margin-related risks and opportunities in the fourth quarter is largely unchanged from last. Loan and deposit pricing provide the primary opportunities for an expanding margin, as significant additional deposit growth and product mix shift seems less likely the remainder of the year. The primary risks include the possibility that loan balances will continue to decline or that nonperforming loan growth will resume. ", "Netting the pluses and minuses, our guidance on future net interest margin is also largely unchanged from last quarter. We believe margin will remain relatively stable in the short run with some modest additional expansion possible during the remainder of the year. I really do want to emphasize the words relatively stable and modest for the fourth quarter outlook, as the risk and opportunity appear to be balanced at this time.", "Let's move to slide nine in the provision expense. Tom is going to cover credit in detail in a minute so I'm going to be brief here.", "Total provision expense for the quarter was $1.1 billion up $172 million from the second quarter, with more than all of this increase driven by charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased to just over $1 billion, up 26% from the second quarter level to 3.3% of loans.", "Provision of $128 million was reported in excess of net charge-offs in the quarter to build a loan loss reserve to just over $3 billion or 2.6% of loans. Excess provisions to build the reserve has declined in each of the last three quarters as leading asset quality indicators have been largely improving or stable. ", "Let's move to non-interest income on slide 10. Reported non-interest income growth was down 28% and 40% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. However, after adjustments for a number of items in each quarter, non-interest income declined 9% and 15% respectively. ", "There are a lot of positive and negative adjustments so we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation. The largest adjustment to the third quarter results was $131 million evaluation loss on our fair value debt as I\u2019ve mentioned earlier as SunTrust\u2019s credit spread narrowed again this quarter.", "We also adjusted for a net gain on the sale of securities of $47 million related to the repositioning of the mortgage backed securities portfolio. Even after the adjustments though, non-interest income was down approximately $80 million versus last quarter, and the majority of the decline occurred in mortgage production income.", "Volume did contribute to the decline with closed volume dropping over 30% and application volume declining by over 40%. However, over half of the decline in production income is due to a $136 million impact from mortgage repurchase reserves, which was up $74 million relative to the second quarter.", "While repurchase requests have been volatile and hard to predict, agency request volume and loss severity increased significantly in the third quarter, and as a result, we increased our reserves to reflect the higher current run rate of such losses.", "Moving to mortgage servicing income, it appears to have declined significantly on the face of the income statement quarter-over-quarter. However, adjusting for the recovery of temporary MSR impairment reported last quarter, mortgage servicing income actually improved as the performance of our fair value MSRs and related hedges was neutral to the income statement as compared to modest underperformance last quarter.", "Coming off of a record second quarter level, we also reported another strong quarter for investment banking fees in both debt and equity capital markets, due primarily to strong origination volumes in both areas.", "While core trading account profits and commissions declined sequentially, driven in large part by results in equity derivatives and fixed income sales and trading in the third quarter, revenues were up significantly from the third quarter of last year.", "Performance in most other non-interest income categories was acceptable with stable to higher revenues versus the second quarter reported in most other categories. However, overall non-interest income continues to be soft in investment related areas such as trust income and retail investment services, as well as in service charges on deposit accounts as higher balance depressed business and consumer fee income.", "Now, turning to slide 11 and non-interest expense which continues to be a good story for SunTrust. Non-interest expense declined 14% when compared to the third quarter of last year and 6% compared to last quarter. On this slide we have adjusted out some items that are detailed in the appendix and the larger items include last year's contribution of Coke stock to our charitable foundation, and last quarter's FDIC special assessment.", "The primary adjustment in the current quart is a $31 million write-down of our investment in certain affordable housing properties. So, excluding these items, expenses are down over 4% compared to the same quarter last year and down 1% quarter-over-quarter.", "Even though these numbers are positive at face value, there are a few items impacting the comparison that warrant additional explanation and are listed in the lower section of the slide. Let me explain the schedule. The total year-over-year decrease in adjust expense is $63 million. As you can see, the sum of the three lines below the $63 million is a decrease of $14 million, and therefore the expense decrease net of these drivers is the $49 million at the bottom of the schedule.", "Now, what we want you to understand is that core expenses that are pro-cyclical and seasonal in nature are impacting the expense comparison. The conclusion of the year-over-year analysis is that the decrease in credit related costs of $67 million was partially offset by higher FDIC and pension costs, and therefore net of all remaining expenses declined $49 million or 3.4% of the adjusted third quarter 2008 level.", "The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is a little different, in that sum of the drivers is an increase in expenses and that the net of all remaining expenses of $24 million equates to a decrease of 1.7%, which is largely driven by lower personnel expense. Overall, core expense management continues to be strong as we move through this period of time in 2009.", "What I\u2019d like to do now, if you look at a couple of extra items in the third quarter that are worth additional commentary. The first is a decline in FDIC expense this quarter versus last. In anticipation of higher rates, we increased our accrual upward for this expense earlier in the year and now with greater clarity we had an adjustment downward for lower than originally anticipated assessment rates.", "Given current deposit levels and assessment rates, and barring unforeseen circumstances, we expect the FDIC premium expense line item to roughly return to approximately $70 million quarterly run rate in the near term.", "Secondly, we have added a line to our list of credit related costs this quarter; unfunded commitment reserves. This item rolls into the other expense line in our financial statements. In the third quarter, we recorded a $29 million expense to increase this reserve for binding off-balance sheet commitments compared to a small decrease last quarter and a $16 million increase in the third quarter of last year.", "The increase in reserve requirements this quarter is due to a few larger corporate borrowers and some migration in risk ratings in the portfolio. So, before turning it over to Tom Freeman, what I would like to do is summarize the company's results during the quarter.", "SunTrust capital and liquidity positions improved, net interest margin expanded, and deposit mix was further enhanced, and certain fee areas were strong. While charge-offs were up in line with expectations, delinquencies were relatively stable and NPAs declined during the quarter.", "We recognized that loan demand in certain fee income categories continued to be soft and that the economic environment remains uncertain at this time as Jim said. However, there are components of our results for the quarter which gives us encouragement as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2010.", "Now, with that, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to go over our asset quality results.", "Tom Freeman", "Thank you, Mark. This morning I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on slide 12. Charge-offs increased by roughly $200 million to 26% compared to last quarter. Expected increases in the construction, mortgage and C&I portfolios drove the majority of the growth.", "Last quarter during the call, we noted some positive signs in certain areas. This quarter, in addition to early stage delinquency remaining stable, nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined slightly compared to last quarter. Nonperforming assets declined by $70 million dollars compared to an increase of $919 million last quarter. Decreases in most categories were partially offset by small increase in residential mortgage nonperformers, although we had an absolute decline in the dollar level of nonperforming loans and assets. The corresponding ratios to total loans increased due to a decline in loan balances. The denominator effect also tempered the early stage delinquency ratio.", "Overall dollars 30 to 89 days past due declined $124 million or 6.5%. The past due ratio to period end loans only decreased two basis points to 1.52%, as loan balances declined over 5%. If loan balances remained constant, the decrease in delinquency would have been eight basis points or 1.44% rate. We increased the allowance to 2.61% of period end loans in the quarter for an overall increase of 24 basis points. Provision exceeded net charge-offs by $128 million. This is the third consecutive quarter of a slowing pace of dollar increases to the reserve, and a trend that is likely to continue next quarter, as long as delinquency and NPL trends remain in place.", "Please turn to slide 13 for review of the loan portfolio. Asset quality issues remain primarily residential real estate related, including residential mortgages, home equity products, residential construction and construction to firm. Commercial charge-offs increased in the third quarter as expected, given the growth in NPL\u2019s last quarter. We are seeing some increased stress in our overall C&I portfolio. However, the stress is still most evident in a small number of larger credits in more cyclically sensitive industries and in our small business portfolio.", "Early stage delinquencies were down, although the delinquency ratio did drift upward due to the decline in portfolio allowance. Despite the difficult economic environment, the portfolio performance remains adequate. The commercial real estate portfolio also continues to perform reasonably well overall. Our net charge-off ratio increased this quarter, the dollar increase was only $18 million. Of this amount, the majority was related to [one loan] secured by an owner-occupied property to a manufacturer supplying the auto industry.", "Asset quality is similar to last quarter in the consumer direct and indirect portfolios. Charge-offs increased by a relatively small $11 million combined in these portfolios. Federally guaranteed or privately insured student loans caused an uptick in the direct portfolios early stage delinquency while the indirect auto portfolio saw delinquency decline. Please also note that our exposure to credit cards is quite small, less than 1% of the portfolio and only half of it is consumer cards.", "I am going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now I will summarize. Home equity performance was basically stable in the quarter. Charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio increased 20% due to higher severities coupled with a higher volume of completed foreclosures. Construction charge-offs nearly doubled to $157 million this quarter as we completed more workout foreclosure efforts.", "Next, I will discuss a number of our portfolios in more detail, beginning with a commercial and industrial or C&I portfolio on slide 14. Our C&I portfolio is well diversified by industry, client segment, geography and collateral. Losses to date in this portfolio have come primarily from smaller businesses and a handful of larger clients in more cyclical industries, including construction, media and automotive related sectors. You can see in the top right breakdown that the small business clients comprise 5% or less than $2 billion of our C&I portfolio. On the other hand, large corporate makes up 32% of the book while commercial lending is 39% of the portfolio. In spite of the concentration of the large corporate and commercial, the portfolio is quite [granular] with an average outstanding of less than $1 million per loan.", "Within our corporate and investment banking segment, we have specialty practice teams targeting certain industries nationally. Loans to these clients are typically one aspect of the overall relationship and are typically unsecured shared national credits. Last quarter, we commented positively on our shared national credit exposure, and Jim recently said in an industry conference that we had received the exam report and expected no significant negative impacts as a result. We have now had a chance to analyze the report more closely and the exam had no material adverse effect as we previously indicated.", "Overall, the C&I portfolio continues to perform reasonably well, given the environment. We have seen migration in risk ratings, it has mostly been associated with a limited set of cyclical industries, including those linked to construction, auto dealers, specialty retailers, and advertising based media firms.", "If you'll turn to slide 15, I'll provide some details on our commercial real estate portfolio. I noted earlier that our commercial real estate portfolio had continued to perform adequately so far in the cycle. While I'm not able to tell you what the future holds in terms of absolute performance in this portfolio, I can tell you that we believe this business will continue to perform adequately. One of the reasons for this view is our commercial real estate portfolio is largely owner-occupied. Rental revenue from the property is not the primary source of debt service; rather the underlying business service is the debt. I will focus the rest of my comments on the investor-owned portfolio.", "Looking at the information on the right hand side of this slide, our investor-owned portfolio is well diversified by borrower, geography and property type. The portfolio was conservatively underwritten at origination. Historically, we\u2019ve taken a more traditional view in underwriting as compared to those who underwrote for the CMBS structures. Additionally, the vast majority of our investor loans have (inaudible) relationship clients. Our largest geographic concentration is in the Mid-Atlantic states while the smallest is in Florida at 18% of the investor book. The portfolio is quite granular. The overall portfolio has an average loan size of roughly $700,000 while the investor-owned portfolio distribution displayed here as a $1 million average loan size.", "You can see on the far right that we have 12 loans exceeding $30 million. The largest loan is a $54 million office building in which SunTrust is the largest tenant. While the other loan over $50 million is an office building that is currently 99.6% leased. The two largest investor-owned product categories retail and office are also granular with average loan sizes of $1.4 million and $800,000 respectively. Our typical retail project is an [anchor strip] center within our footprint in the suburban location. We do not typically finance large urban office projects or regional malls. Finally, in the multi-family category, the average loan size is $1.1 million and projects in Florida represent only 15% of the total. We do not typically finance large urban condo or rental projects.", "The current environment has resulted in ratings migration within the investor-owned portfolio. To-date the migration has largely occurred within the past [grades].", "In summary, our selection of relationships, our underwriting at origination, project selection, diversification and the granularity of this portfolio support our belief. This portfolio will perform comparatively well. ", "Please turn to slide 16 and an update on the mortgage portfolio. The residential mortgage portfolio continued to perform poorly, with an analyzed charge-off ratio of 4.9% this quarter. However the slow pace of deterioration we noted last quarter continued this quarter, with lower growth and non-accrual balances and stable levels of delinquency. ", "As we have noted in the past, loans in Florida comprise roughly a third of the mortgage portfolio that are contributing well over half the asset quality issues. Balances in most of higher risk portfolios continue to run off this quarter. ", "For delinquency, both 30 to 89 and the 60 plus buckets improved in the core portfolio, and increased in the other products. We believe continued recessionary pressures on homeowners and seasonality are the primary catalyst for increased delinquency in the non-core portfolios. The same issues are impacting the core portfolio. ", "However, the higher quality nature of the portfolio and our own increased modification efforts are likely mitigating factors. ", "In summary, we are pleased that the deterioration is slowing and perhaps even [stabilized], suggesting that the frequency of losses may moderate. However, our expectation that weakness in jobs and incomes in our markets will continue, and then home values will decline further in Florida, suggest that loss severity may increase. ", "The net of these impacts on our outlook for mortgage and asset quality is that we expect the level of charge-offs will remain elevated for at least the next two quarters. ", "Moving to home equity lines on slide 17; home equity credit performance is for the most part driven by the highest (inaudible) segments in the program portfolio; lines originated by third parties and lines in Florida exceeding combined loan to value of 80%. These two segments account for just 22% of our balances, which generate a disproportionate share of losses. ", "Balances continue to decline in the higher risk segments, as they are in run-off with little or no line availability and no new production. Overall, this portfolio displayed stable or better charge-offs and non-accrual metrics in nearly all segments. However, early stage delinquency increased modestly, suggesting that losses will remain elevated, at least in the short run. ", "If you turn to slide 18, I will talk about our construction portfolio. As expected, and continuing a multi-quarter trend, construction balances declined 10% in the third quarter, and now comprise just 6% of our loan portfolio. Construction to perm loans continue to decline and the portfolio is stabilizing. Compared to the second quarter, balances, delinquency and non-performers decreased. ", "This portfolio is now $730 million recently underwritten and stable portfolio, and a $300 million workout portfolio, which has been heavily charged already. Residential builder charge-offs increased significantly in the quarter, as we continued to work the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. ", "As a result, nonperforming loans declined slightly. However, non-performers remain in excess of $1.1 billion and slightly over a third of the portfolio. ", "Even though delinquencies declined, we expect elevated charge-offs in this portfolio, to continue as we complete workouts over the next couple of quarters. ", "Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Charge-offs and delinquencies increased modestly in the quarter, and nonperforming loans remained stable at approximately $130 million. ", "Please turn to slide 19, for an update on allowance and nonperforming loans. We have stated many times that our reserve methodology is fundamentally focused on estimating incurred losses. We have further said that allowance coverage of nonperforming loans is simply not an input or consideration in the process of setting the reserve. ", "However, the allowance of nonperforming ratio is a commonly used metric, and therefore we provided this disclosure slide last quarter and have updated it this quarter. ", "As a reminder, this slide incorporates the analysis of residential mortgage NPLs that is included in the appendix of today's presentation into a framework that includes our FAS 114 reserves. ", "Result of this analysis is that allowance coverage of nonperforming loan increases from 57% to 109%, when you factor in the impact of mortgages that have been written down and loans with specific reserves. A table of the FAS 114 reserves for commercial loans by business is also included on this slide. ", "We have included this detail to provide you some perspective on the level's specific reserves and implied severities for our larger impaired loans. While overall implied severity varies by business segment, the average is 36%. ", "Please turn to slide 20 for a brief discussion of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting Troubled Debt Restructures or TDRs. Two facts are readily apparent from this slide. The first is the pace of mortgage restructuring has increased, and the second is that most of the growth is in the accruing category. ", "I'm going to spend a couple of minutes talking about our modification efforts and results. I want to be clear that my comments only relate to SunTrust-owned portfolio. ", "At the end of the third quarter, accruing TDRs total $1.3 billion, up almost $420 million or 45% from the second quarter; non-accruing TDRs were $677 million. The vast majority of our TDRs are residential mortgage loans. Modifications are increasing because SunTrust tries to avoid a foreclosure and subsequent liquidation sale if at all possible. ", "We are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that the modification will allow the client to continue serving the debt. When there has been a loss of income such as that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we are strongly encouraging short sales and deemed (inaudible) arrangements. ", "New mortgage modifications during the third quarter totaled roughly $560 million, most of which are classified as TDRs. But at the third quarter modifications, 59% were for still accruing loans, while the remaining 41% were seriously delinquent loans in non-accrual status, where they will continue to be reported until they go through the cure period. ", "In the third quarter, over 80% of our new mortgage modifications included both reduced rates and term assess extensions. Another 8% of our third quarter modifications were converting arms to fixed rate loans for clients unable to refinance in a traditional fashion. ", "Obviously the key measure of success with modifications is a re-default rate. Before I go further on this topic, I will caution there is no standard definition of re-default, and that comparative industry data is scarce and dated. However, when we compare SunTrust results to OCC data reported through the fourth quarter of 2008, our performance was somewhat better than the OCC aggregated data. ", "Our own recent performance tracking shows that our more recent modifications are performing better than modifications made prior to 2009. ", "Final discussion point on this topic relates to the requirement to establish FAS 114 reserves for TDRs. Our FAS 114 reserve at [9.30] for TDRs was $226 million. In addition, we have already recorded $97 million in charge-offs on the non-accruing TDRs. I will summarize key points from today's credit update before turning the call back over to Steve.", "Please turn to slide 21. Overall, credit quality remains weak, while increases in construction, mortgage and C&I charge-offs occurred as anticipated. We are pleased that delinquency and nonperforming assets remain stable.", "We continue to work through inherent risk in the home equity, residential mortgage and builder portfolios. We are making progress in these higher risk portfolios. The allowance for losses increased to 2.61% of loans due to provision in excess of charge-offs of a $128 million and declining loan balances.", "Improvements in delinquencies and nonperforming loans in the quarter are encouraging relative to future losses. Overall, our outlook is for elevated credit losses in the near term, with the possibility that improvement will begin at some point in 2010, depending on the strength and the pace of economic recovery. Specifically for the fourth quarter, we do not expect a significant increase or decrease in charge-offs compared to the third quarter.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Shriner", "We'll begin taking questions in just a moment. First, in order to accommodate as many of you as possible, I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, I think we are ready for the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Brian Foran from Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "You mentioned Florida home prices and that you expect them to continue to fall. How much further are you expecting and is the recent improvement Case-Shiller data just a head fake in your opinion?", "Jim Wells", "For our forecasting purposes, we generally use the Case-Shiller data, and so are expecting between 15% and 20% declines right now in the Florida market. That\u2019s a really bad answer because there are five or six separate markets. Some of the northern and more central markets are showing much better performance with South Florida actually beginning to show some signs of improvement. We are seeing increasing home sales in Florida, and backlogs are reducing somewhat. However, the real answer is 15% to 20% is what's in our forecast.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "And then on the NPA improvement, the dollars of NPA improvement, did you give or can you give a breakdown between inflows, pay downs, and any loans sales that happened in the quarter?", "Jim Wells", "We don't disclose those individual flows. We still had clear inflows. Our ability to balance with better outflows this quarter was actually fairly significant. One thing I can share with you is that we managed the business on a statistic which is basically homes or properties available for sale. ", "So, during the quarter, we are able to get through in 90 days, about 75% of the available for sale inventory on a rolling basis. That has been a significantly improving statistic for us. It\u2019s helping us as we get better flow through the foreclosure process, specifically in Florida for rapid disposition of the assets and making sure we don't hold them for long periods of time on the balance sheet.", "Steve Shriner", "Thanks, Brian. One other point, this is Steve. We did not conduct any bulk or large sales of nonperforming or ORE this quarter, so normal course of business inflows and outflows.", "Operator", "The next question is from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "First just on the home equity portfolio. It\u2019s looking like delinquencies are continuing to rise here. Can you talk about some of the drivers here? Any reason to think that this third quarter could have been the peak in home equity delinquencies? That was just my first question.", "Jim Wells", "None of us feel comfortable telling you that things have peeked or that the world is rapidly getting better. The drivers in delinquencies, primarily in the home equity portfolio, really people who are stuck in this long and stayed with it, these are primarily folks who have lost their jobs or have been hit by one of the three Ds in the foreclosure process, which is death, disease or divorce, and that\u2019s primarily what drives the increase in delinquency. The unemployment stuff correlates very strongly to the default rates.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Got it. Then we also saw that charge-offs came down in this bucket this quarter. Was it an unusual level in the second quarter? Is this kind of a good run rated for home equity or with rising delinquencies due to rising unemployment should we think this should go back up?", "Jim Wells", "What we saw was stability in the rolls in the buckets and slight improvement in the ability to go from the short-term to current to the longer term delinquencies. So, my first look at it is, we are getting stability in the roll rates, which is really accounting for the modification in the charge off rates.", "Mark Chancy", "On page 17 of our presentation we give you some data that non-accrual loans overall in the home equity portfolio were down in terms of percentage as well as the charge-off data. So, we give you a little bit of a breakdown there if you want to go through the individual components.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Got it. I saw that. I just saw the delinquencies went up, too. But, yeah. Thank for answering my question.", "Mark Chancy", "You\u2019ve got a denominator issue there too that you need to adjust for.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jefferson Harralson from KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - KBW", "Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask a question on the performing, accruing TDRs. You mentioned it was better than the government numbers, but can you just talk about what percentage of these you think will go nonperforming overtime or what your experience has been with accruing TDRs?", "Jim Wells", "This is kind of a difficult area to talk about because there are no standards out there, and while we are working with not only the regulatory agencies to get transparency around this, there are four or five different measures, all of which are confusing as to term to re-default and what the default looks like and ever delinquent statistics.", "So, it's really difficult for us to quote you a set of numbers, but with each one of the statistics we find, we find that we are a little better than I think what the statistics show. We are also pretty aggressive when we do one of these restructures and making sure we qualify the borrowers to ensure they have enough money not only to meet their mortgage payments but to meet their other obligations and enough cash flow to live on.", "So, our recidivism rates I think are a little better than what the industry statistics show because our willingness just to do overall blanket restructures isn't very high. We really want to know what the clients are doing, what their income levels are, and making sure that we are doing something that's in everybody's best interest.", "Jefferson Harralson - KBW", "Can you talk about your restructuring efforts in commercial real estate? How successful you guys have been in getting additional collateral in exchange for additional [length] at maturity, or is that an effort you guys are actively doing?", "Jim Wells", "What we are doing in the commercial real estate book. There are two parts of the commercial real estate book. The first part of the commercial real estate book is really the homebuilders\u2019 portfolio which we have been talking to you for five or six quarters now about our active efforts to mitigate the losses in that portfolio, work with the developers when it is possible and liquidate the assets as quickly as we possibly can. That is more of a liquidation mode around many of them. Although we do have a fairly large number of the developers that still have recurring cash flow and the capability to continue see this through we think for the next three or four years. So we have a workout group, a very large group of people working on that.", "In terms of the income producing portfolios, we regularly review all of the loans in the portfolio, their cash flows, their borrowers, what's going on in the portfolios, and we'll work through modifications, renewals, extensions, depending upon current restructuring activity, or what's going on within the marketplace. We are actively working the portfolio all the time. If you take a look at the delinquency and nonperforming statistics, you'll see that we have been pretty successful in continuing to work with our clients and avoiding the deep problem and I think Central City sort of activities you are seeing pop-up around the system at the moment.", "Operator", "The next question is from Terry McEvoy from Oppenheimer.", "Terry McEvoy \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Look at your slide 15, the breakdown of the commercial real estate portfolio. Could you maybe separate the owner-occupied from the investor-owned commercial real estate loans or nonperforming assets of around $302 million? I'm guessing there is more in that investor-owned bucket. The second part of that question is, geographically speaking does the Florida group contribute a greater share of those nonperforming loans?", "Mark Chancy", "In the investor-owned portfolio, I believe if you take a look at couple of the slides, you'll see what the delinquency rates are in the investor-owned portfolio, because the nonperformers are primarily comprised of the construction part of the portfolio, and so most of our delinquencies in this area really are coming in the investor-owned portion of the portfolio, but primarily in the homebuilder part of the portfolio. I think that was the first part of the question.", "Steve Shriner", "Terry, I think your question was focused particularly on the investor-owned commercial real estate line.", "Terry McEvoy \u2013 Oppenheimer", "That's correct.", "Steve Shriner", "We want to make sure we don't confuse you here. Construction is some place else.", "Terry McEvoy \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Yes, I was looking at slide 15.", "Jim Wells", "We haven't provided a public breakdown of the performer and nonperformer split. Off the top of my head, I don't have that information. I'll look around and I've got a couple of members of management teams here. If anybody has it, we'll provide it, but I don't know that number.", "Mark Chancy", "Yeah, the $300 million I would say in the portfolio, about $200 million dollars of it comes out of the income portion of the portfolio.", "Jim Wells", "The amount of stuff that's in Florida is not consequential and isn't showing to perform worse than the rest of the portfolios.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bob Patton from Morgan Keegan.", "Bob Patton - Morgan Keegan", "Most my questions have been asked. A real quick question on FDIC transactions. How do you think you guys are positioned relative to starting to look more progressively at the FDIC activity?", "Jim Wells", "This is Jim. We are fully capable and willing to assist when asked to do so. As I have said several times, our position basically is we don't feel the need to do that. Our organic growth is going nicely and our organic growth prospects are going nicely. It is frequently diverting, but should an occasion arise if we would be asked to be help, we would of course are going to do that.", "Bob Patton - Morgan Keegan", "Do you sense the activity is picking up in your market?", "Jim Wells", "In our market it has been picked up, I guess is the way I would describe that. You have the same statistics we do about the FDIC's list of problem institutions and those sorts of things. It is not really broken down geographically as far as I remember, anyway. But the reality is in troubled markets and we have some on our footprint, I would expect the activity to pick up, but there is no way to know that.", "Bob Patton - Morgan Keegan", "And then to Mark, are you going to hold the balance sheet stable or do you see continued shrinkage and sort of that run rate and what are the drivers?", "Mark Chancy", "As you saw during the course of the third quarter, we did increase the securities portfolio as the loan balances decline. We evaluate the addition of securities and other earning assets in regard to a number of factors as you expect. The interest rate sensitivity, our liquidity position, the overall duration of the balance sheet. We are also asset sensitive, but it currently has a view the fed is unlikely to increase rates in the near term and we are at a very strong liquidity position. ", "With the decline in loans we have added to the portfolio and we are likely to do so in the near term. We have replaced some of the mortgage-backed securities that were sold at the end of the quarter, as I mentioned earlier here in the early part of October. ", "We do think it's important to retain maximum flexibility with the securities that we purchase, and as a result, we have invested in low credit risks and highly liquid securities and you should expect that to continue.", "Bob Patton - Morgan Keegan", "What is the percentage of loans on floors at Sun Trust?", "Jim Wells", "You had your one and your two.", "Operator", "The next question is from Greg Ketron from Citigroup.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "Thomas this question probably goes to you and I know you probably are getting tired of answering the credit questions, but in terms of reserve build, you had a decline this quarter. Is there any read-through or implications on that in terms of the underlying credit quality of the overall portfolio? Is this something we may see going forward, as you have seen early stage delinquencies stabilize NPL influence or the net NPLs were stabilized going forward?", "Tom Freeman", "The two components of losses, Greg, as you well know are frequency and severity. What we are seeing across many of the portfolio is the level of individual defaults, especially in the mortgage portfolios and on the retail side of the house is improving delinquencies in comps and dollars. ", "The one mitigating factor for that is really what's going to go on in the housing markets, and specifically the largest housing market we have to be concerned with is Florida. The rest of our housing markets are showing stability, really the fallen value seem to have mitigated and some of them more in fact are showing increasing positive value growth within the market segments that we are struck with. ", "The need to build because we are getting, increasing frequency of loss seems to be mitigating and really any need to grow at the moment, given what's going on in the marketplace, it could all change tomorrow, it has to do with making sure we've got a good handle on the severities.", "Greg Ketron - Citigroup", "If I can do a follow-up question on the mortgage repurchase reserve, is there any color you can give on the potential size of that or where you may be in that process in terms of needing to continue to recognize expenses associated with that?", "Bill Rogers", "Similar to what other companies are experiencing, but I think ours has been proportional and it is sort of all over the board. So, if you think June and July were sort of high, August was down; September was down, October sort of there. So, I think what you'll see is relative to the past, you know, a year ago, it will continue to be at some high levels, relative to this quarter. I think through the next few quarters in 2010, we should see this coming down as some of the earlier winnings sort of work their way through.", "Operator", "The next question is from Kevin Fitzsimmons from Sandler O'Neill.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "On slide 11, when you talk about credit related costs, the $215 million, I'm assuming the bulk of that is OREO expenses. Is that something you breakout anywhere just in terms of what to expect from a run rate would we expect that kind of pace going forward?", "Steve Shriner", "If you flip back to page 25 in the appendix where we breakdown the $215 million into one, two, three, five components, I think your answer is there. If I got the question right?", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "It certainly is. Thank you very much. Just one additional one for Mark. The trading account write-downs, this is obviously an item that fluctuates quarter-to-quarter. Any sense based on what you are seeing today, how we should look at it? I know it\u2019s tough to talk in terms of run rate for that line item, but how we should look at that going forward?", "Mark Chancy", "Kevin, if you go back to the end of 2007, we acquired about $3.5 billion worth of securities. We are down below $200 million at this point. Many of the residual securities during the course of the third quarter actually had modest write-ups, and so the risk associated with that trading portfolio has largely been recognized and we are managing through that residual portfolio.", "We also have the auction rate securities that we acquired back a little over a year ago. We have marked them appropriately at the time and we\u2019ve had some modest write-ups since then. So, I think on balance, that's not one of the core risks to SunTrust as we move forward.", "Steve Shriner", "Kevin, this is Steve. If you think about the trading activity in the quarter, we were a little soft on equity derivatives and fixed income trading. So, it was a little softer than the last quarter in the trading line. It has had some volatility on an adjusted basis. It\u2019s been probably $50 million, $60 million. Kind of each of the past couple of quarters and then trended down some, and that\u2019s just kind of core client business activity. As you know, it is fairly hard to predict.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Right. However, obviously in this quarter the big item was the debt, right, the debt write-down.", "Jim Wells", "Even after you adjust for that, you would still see that, what's left after the adjustments I gave you in the appendix, even after you do that, you'll see the trading was a little soft this quarter. It really was kind of core client activity.", "Mark Chancy", "A very strong trading activity in the SunTrust Robinson Humphrey on a year over year basis, but down sequentially coming off a record quarter in the second quarter.", "Steve Shriner", "Thank you, everybody. I appreciate your attendance at this morning's call.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Parties will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. (Operator instruction) ", "I\u2019d like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Steve Shriner, the Director of Investor Relations.", "Steve Shirner", "Good morning, welcome to SunTrust\u2019s fourth quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to the press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation that covers the topics we planned to address during the call today. Slide two outlines the content, which includes an overview of the quarter, financial results discussion and an in-depth credit review. Press release presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, which is www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "With me today, among other members of our Executive Management team are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer; Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter, Mark will then discuss financial performance, and Tom will conclude with the review of asset quality. At the conclusion of formal remarks, we\u2019ll open the session for questions.", "Before I get started, I need to remind that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual result to differ materially. We list the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filing, which are also available on our website. ", "Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made and we disclaim any responsibility to do so. During the call, we\u2019ll discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on the website. ", "Finally, SunTrust does not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.", "Jim Wells", "Good morning, again. I\u2019d like to join with Steve and thanking for being with us this morning. As has been the case for several quarters now, our results were affected by the challenging economic environment. We reported $0.64 per share loss for the fourth quarter and $3.98 loss for the full year. As you would expect in this type of operating environment revenue was soft, loan demand was down and asset quality was weak. ", "So like last quarter, they were certain positive operating trends. The most notable positive in the fourth quarter was improved credit trends from the prior quarter. Both credit losses and early stage to delinquencies declined, and non-performing loans were stable. Further deposit growth and the positive mix shift continued. The Net interest margin significantly expanded and certain businesses delivered very solid revenue growth.", "Now before we provided detail on the results, I want to point out that our optimism is certainly tempered during those positive trends, especially those related to credit. The economy remains far from strong and there\u2019s more uncertainty and then clarity in the outlook.", "As I\u2019ve said before, the beginning of recovery is just added to beginning, history tells us that it will take sometime before economics stabilization meaningfully translate in the bottom line results. Asset quality revenues and ultimately earnings improvement will need time to gain transaction and that timing is largely dependent from the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery.", "Now taking a closer look at the overall results, revenue remains soft with stable net interest income and a small increase in non-interest income over the same quarter last year. Unchanged net interest income was the result of a significantly improved net interest margin, which was offset by the reduction in average earning assets.", "An increase in client deposits, improved mix, and lower rates paid enabled the reduction in higher cost sources of funding and pushed the margin higher, while loans and earning assets declined more rapidly, offsetting that benefit. What we\u2019re seeing is that sustained economic weakness has reduced demand for loans as clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction and many have also accessed the debt markets in lieu of bank loans.", "Additionally, overall fee revenue remains cyclically soft, reduced consumer spending was evident in the declined in many fee related sources of income throughout there the year. Those I mentioned, there were selective positive trends that emerged. For instance, investment banking income improved significantly over 2008 to a record level. Capital markets activity was higher in 2009, and as the year progressed, and numbers reflected the improved operating environment for our corporate and investment banking businesses.", "In commercial banking, we\u2019ve been able to improve loan spreads, despite the fact that the appetite for loans has been weak during the recession. Further while deposit growth was cyclical, there are strong indications that a part of the employees was SunTrust specific. We are improving client satisfaction and getting to the drivers that build loyalty by understanding individual preferences and learning our business models to respond.", "As a result, we\u2019ve increased client satisfaction and it showed up in our deposit numbers in 2009. This reflects favorably on the tremendous effort being put forth by our team to improve client retention and acquisition capabilities. The result of disciplined expense management was evident again across controllable operating expenses this quarter.", "As you\u2019ve haired me emphasize before, we continue to capitalize upon the strength we have built in this area, and we remain focused on continuously uncovering efficiency and improving opportunities. Cyclical costs including other real estate, FDIC, pension and credit, and collection costs remain high.", "On the asset-quality front, we are quite pleased with the lower charge-offs and improved metrics generally. I was alluded to earlier, we\u2019re not ready to declare a victory, in fact we believe charge-offs will increase modestly in the next quarter. Tom Freeman will provide more commentary on credit expectation later on. ", "It all comes down to this that all of those sum things, notably the economic and regulatory environment are ultimately out of our control. I believe we are doing a very good job of controlling the things that we can control. We are laser focused on improved credit and risk related results.", "At the same time, we are focused on the client on improving service quality and front line execution, while controlling expenses and managing risk. The positive results of our efforts are reflected in various aspects of our core performance over the last few quarters. Our continued success in these areas will permit us to deliver steadily improving results as the credit operating environment improves.", "Turning to slide four, I\u2019d like to talk about our capital position, before turning the call over to Mark. Slide four illustrates our significant capital position and our book value per share. We maintain a solid capital position with an estimated Tier 1 common ratio, 7.65% and a Tier 1 ratio of 12.90%.", "Capital ratios increased as the decline in risk related asset more than offset the reduction of capital due to the earnings loss in the fourth quarter. We continue to have substantial liquidities, the aforementioned inflow of deposits have been largely retained in cash and invested in high quality government-backed securities. Book value was $35.29 and tangible common was $22.59 at the close of the year.", "A final note on capital, given a 9.5% Tier 1 ratio, excluding TARP, and our current capital and liquidity, we are well positioned to repay TARP when regulatory approval is received. I\u2019ll conclude by underscoring a point of this is true today it has been in throughout 2009.", "SunTrust continues to operate from a position of strength, and we are focused on growing revenue, improving expense efficiency, increasable the profitability of the balance sheet, investing for the future, and prudently managing credit. Our strong foundation coupled with our client focused execution, broad risk mitigation capabilities, and the long term economic prospects of our markets all position us to deliver improving financial performance as we move beyond this cycle.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. Mark.", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks, Jim and good morning, everybody. I\u2019ll begin my comments today on slide five of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $316 million or $0.64 per share. ", "As has been the case in recent quarters, our financial results continued to be dominated by credit losses, cyclically sensitive expenses and to a lesser extend soft revenue generation in certain units. In particular for the quarter, loan demand remained weak, and mortgage production income was negatively impacted by the cost associated with the potential repurchase of mortgage loans originated and sold the government agencies in prior periods", "On the other hand, there are some positive operating trends that I will also point out. Most notably is the decline in provision, primarily driven by lower charge-offs. Additionally, margin and net interest income increased as the deposit mix continued to improve, while core client deposits grew. I\u2019ll cover this reported result in more detail in just a minute.", "For the full year 2009, the loss to common shareholders was $3.98 per share, and $2.34 per share, if you exclude the impacted of $750 million in goodwill impairment reported in the first quarter. In addition to the impact of goodwill impairment on expenses, there were several areas driving a net loss in 2009, compared to a profit in 2008. The biggest impact of course was credit quality. Provision for credit losses increased by $1.6 billion, as charge-offs rough doubled to $3.2 billion, and we increased the allowance for loan losses by one-third to $3.1 billion.", "Non-interest income decline by $760 million, compared to 2008\u2019s level, and while overall fee generation was somewhat impacted by recessionary pressures. The decline was largely due to the absence of gains associated with the Coke stock transactions that were completed during 2008. The final item of note is the full year cost of dividends on the TARP preferred securities, which increased to $266 million. So with that brief summary of 2009, I\u2019ll now provide more detail on the fourth quarter result, starting on slide six with the balance sheet summary.", "Overall, average loan balances excluding non-accruals declined 4% and 12% as compared to last quarter, and last year respectively. Decline in balances in our higher risk categories continued, but we also experienced the decline in certain of our higher quality categories. On the higher risk side, construction balances continued their rapid decline, down another 12% in the current quarter, and down 47% compared to last year. The residential mortgage and home equity line portfolios also continued their downward trend.", "On the higher quality side, commercial and industrial loans declined 8% sequentially, and are down 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. This reduction resulted primarily from a continued trend of declining line of credit utilization among our mid sized and larger corporate clients due to lower working capital needs, and enhanced access to the capital markets during the quarter, which resulted in loan pay downs.", "However, the pace of decline did slow during the quarter, and in the financial tables we published today, you can see evidence of this, in the roughly equal year end and fourth quarter average balance figures, and in the lower period and sequential quarter decline of 3%, versus the 8% on average. While we are pleased at the pace of decline slowed, it is too early to tell, whether or not this trend will be sustained as we move into the first quarter of 2010.", "Relative to loan volumes, please note that we expect an increase of approximately $2 billion in loans and loans held for sale, as a result of implementing FAS 167 in the first quarter. This consolidation is expected to have minimal impact on capital ratios, and net interest margin, and there is a slide in the appendix that will provide some additional information on this topic for your review.", "Now, moving onto deposits at the bottom of the slide, where you can see that lower cost deposits continued to grow, while higher cost deposits continued to shrink. We noted last quarter, that the pace of growth in deposits had moderated. While growth picked back up this quarter, it is primarily a seasonal increase. Nonetheless, overall average consumer and commercial deposits, increased 2% sequentially this quarter, and remained up 14% on a year-over-year basis.", "While maintaining competitive pricing in our markets, CD balances declined in the quarter, as we have continued to carefully manage the tradeoff between price and volume, given our increased liquidity position. Finally, while there wasn\u2019t much change on a sequential quarter basis, please note that brokered and foreign deposits have been reduced by over $7 billion or nearly 60% compared to the same quarter last year.", "Our current liquidity position has enabled us to take actions I just mentioned to refine and lower the cost of our funding profile. In addition to these actions, we have also increased our securities portfolio, so please turn to slide seven for a brief review of the available for sale portfolio securities.", "The portfolio continues to be concentrated in higher quality and very liquid securities. Government and agency securities in the first four rows of the table comprise over 85 % of the portfolio, and as a reminder, the other equity holdings are largely Coke stock, Federal Reserve, and federal home loan bank stock.", "During the quarter, we increased our holdings of U.S. Treasury securities to over $5 billion. These securities are held at the holder company level specifically in anticipation of ultimate TARP repayment upon regulatory approval. The agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio increased by over $3 billion. This increase along with a net gain of roughly $70 million realized during the quarter represents a continuation of the portfolio repositioning begun at the end of the third quarter, and continued in the fourth quarter.", "Given the growth in the securities portfolio during 2009, and where we are in the rate cycle, let me take a minute to describe how we are thinking about managing this portfolio in 2010. The significant 2009 portfolio growth was driven by two key factors: strong inflow of deposits and declining loan demand. We expect both of these trends to moderate and potentially reverse course in 2010, and as a result, we do not anticipate continued portfolio growth.", "That being said, we will continue our strategy of maintaining the vast majority of our portfolio in highly liquid, U.S. government, and agency debt, and mortgage-backed securities. We believe that this approach allows us to generate returns on our excess liquidity, while retaining maximum flexibility to respond the changes in the environment.", "I\u2019ll now take a minute to cover the margin on slide eight. Margin expanded again this quarter, increasing by a better than expected 17 basis points to 327. We\u2019re very pleased with this result, as we were able to reduce deposit pricing more than expected, while at the same time growing core deposits faster than anticipated. Additionally, increased liquidity from deposit growth, coupled with declining loans facilitated a reduction in higher cost debt and federal home loan bank advances.", "Our current expectations for the margin in the first quarter, is for modest compression the full quarter impact of holding $5 billion in treasury securities, and the first quarter consolidation of three pillars, which is our off-balance sheet conduit, are both expected to have a small negative impact on margin.", "Additionally, we expect to experience a seasonal decline in deposits. However, even as these items place some downward pressure on margin, we expect continued progress on loan and deposit pricing to partially mitigate the extent of compression.", "Moving to slide nine and provision expense; Tom will cover credit in detail in just a minute, so I\u2019m going to be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $974 million, down $160 million from the third quarter. Now beginning in the fourth quarter, we have combined the traditional provision for loan losses with the provision for unfunded commitments into a total provision for credit losses. The provision for unfunded commitments was included in other non-interest expense in prior periods.", "Provision for loan losses actually declined over $200 million versus the third quarter, excluding the provision for unfunded commitment reserves. This reduction was driven by $185 million, or 18% decrease in charge-offs, and a slower pace of reserve building. The allowance for loan and lease losses was increased $96 million to $3.1 billion, or 276 as a percentage of loans, while the unfunded commitment reserve increased $57 million to $115 million.", "Now moving on to non-interest income on slide 10; reported non-interest income growth in the quarter was down 4%, and up 3% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. After adjustments for a number of items in each quarter, non-interest income declined by 16%, and 11% respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks, securities gains, and impairment and recovery of mortgage servicing rights carried at the lower of cost or market. As in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.", "In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are for securities gains that $73 million related to the repositioning of the securities portfolio I discussed a minute ago, and a $38 million valuation loss on a fair value debt and related hedges. During the third quarter, the loss associated with the fair value debt was $131 million, at SunTrust credit spreads continued to improve during both periods.", "The primary reason for the decline in adjusted non-interest income is increased mortgage repurchase cost. I\u2019m going to talk about more in detail on the next slide. Excluding this driver produces adjusted growth of 8% on a year-over-year basis, and a 5% decline on a sequential quarter basis.", "The sequential quarter decline was due to lower investment banking, and core trading revenue, and lower mortgage production and servicing income. The sequential decline in investment banking revenue was due to lower equity origination in Syndicated Finance volumes coming off of a very strong second and third quarter performances.", "Core trading declined sequentially primarily due to lower revenues from fixed income and equity derivatives. Mortgage production revenue declined sequentially due to a 27% decrease in a closed volume, and an 11% decrease in application volume. Mortgage servicing revenue declined given a reduction in the out performance our fair value MSR hedge.", "Now, please turn to slide 11, I\u2019m going to provide more detail on the mortgage repurchase trends. This slide depicts the 2009 trends experienced with mortgage repurchases. Before I get into the details, let me remind you that these loans and reserves are for representation and warranty claims associated with mortgages originated by SunTrust and then sold to government-sponsored agencies with servicing rights retained by us.", "Reserves for this repurchase liability are originally established by vintage when the loans are sold, and are accounted for as a reduction in mortgage production income. As credit loss is associated with these loans have exceeded the original estimates at the time of sale, we are now recording higher losses and increasing reserves for loans sold in prior periods.", "Another thing to note is that while these are called repurchase request, more often than not we settle the claim with a make whole payment to the investor in lieu of actually repurchasing the mortgage. To the extend we do repurchase the loan are reflected in our non-performing loan categories.", "On the top left portion of this slide, shows the increasing impact on earnings and growth in the reserve during 2009. To the right, is a graph that illustrates the underlying reasons for the increased impact, indexing new repurchase request, and the period-end inventory of pending request to fourth quarter 2008 level.", "As you can see, after dipping in the first quarter, new repurchase claims from the agencies have steadily increased. On the other line, you can see that in spite of increasing requests, SunTrust has made significant progress in the second half of 2009 in reducing the backlog of pending requests.", "Given the rising level of requests, we had more information available to us to use in our analysis and we\u2019ve significantly augmented the granularity of our analytics during the second half of 2009, by analyzing the population of sold loans by vintage and product in relation to our recent repurchase experience. We believe that we have increased the precision of the current reserve estimate.", "In addition, some underlying trends give us reason to be cautiously optimistic about future losses and reserves. Specifically, on the bottom left of this slide, you can see the vintage of repurchase request has shifted from older to newer-vintage loans. On the right hand side, you can see that the risk profile of the newer vintages is significantly lower. For example, the original loan-to-value declines with newer production even as home prices were continuing to decline.", "This suggests significantly lower loss severity as the repurchase request shifted to newer vintages. Also, in addition to the statistics presented, be tightened credit, and underwriting guidelines, added enhanced fraud detection tools and implemented a whole host of process improvements that cause us to believe that the rate of successful requests will decline overtime.", "In conclusion, the increased demand activity has allowed us to recalibrate and refine the precision of our estimate of incurred losses, and as a result, we have more confidence that the reserve should not increase significantly from here. As for charge-offs, fourth quarter request volumes and vintage composition suggest that losses are likely to remain elevated forth over at least the next quarter or two.", "Declining charge-offs and reserves during 2010 are dependant primarily upon a shift in request volume to newer loan vintages and no significant deterioration in the overall asset quality of all loans within agency securities.", "Now turning to slide 12 for review of expenses, non-interest expense declined 8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, and increased 2% compared to last quarter. On this slide, we have adjusted for some items that are relatively modest in amount they are detailed in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.", "A largest adjustment in the quarter is a net $24 million in debt extinguishment costs primarily related to the early termination fees associated with home loan bank advances that were repaid during the quarter. These advance termination were a component of the steps we took during the quarter, to repay wholesale funding and improve margin due to the strong liquidity position we currently enjoy.", "Excluding adjustments, expenses are down 10%, compared to the same quarter last year, and up only 1% compared to last quarter. Now even though these numbers are positive at face value, there are a few items impacting the comparison that warrant additional explanation and are listed in the lower section of the slide.", "Now let me explain the schedule. The total year-over-year decrease in adjusted expenses is $157 million. As you can see, the sum of the expense items under the expense analysis is a decrease of $181 million, and therefore, the expense change net of these items is an increase of $24 million noted at the very bottom.", "What this means is that the large decline in expenses is driven by the decrease in credit-related costs associated with fraud and mortgage re-insurance losses, and partially offset by higher FDIC premium and pension expenses. The net of all the remaining expense increases of $24 million is only 1.5% of our adjusted fourth quarter 2008 base.", "The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is similar, with declines in other real estate expense and unfunded commitment reserves, partially offset by increased FDIC premiums. The remaining sequential quarter increase in expenses is largely due to personnel and marketing expenses.", "Personnel expenses increased for incentive compensation primarily related to improved performance in certain businesses as headcount remained relatively constant. Advertising and marketing expense was also stepped up in support of our client acquisition, and retention efforts.", "Let me sum up the company\u2019s financial results during the fourth quarter. SunTrust Capital ratios and liquidity position improved. Our deposit levels increased, and the mix was further enhanced and net interest margin expanded. Provision expense declined on lower charge-offs and a smaller addition to the reserve. However, the operating environment continues to be challenging for revenue and cyclical expenses. Loan demand remains weak, and certain fee income categories continue to be soft, while expenses associated with asset quality continued to weigh on performance.", "It goes without saying that 2009 was a difficult year. However, while the pace and strength of the economic recovery remains uncertain, we are encouraged by emerging asset quality trends and by elements within our operating performance and as such, we are looking forward to improving financial results in 2010.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality.", "Tom Freeman", "Thank you, Mark. This morning, I\u2019m going to review our asset quality, beginning on slide 13. As Jim mentioned earlier in the call, we noted some asset quality stabilization this quarter. Short term delinquencies, 90 day-plus delinquencies and charge-offs all continued to decline, along with entrance in to the foreclosure queues.", "Non-performing assets remained flat for the quarter. This is notable as the fourth quarter particularly, for consumers is seasonally expected to show increases in default and delinquencies. In fact, charge-offs declined in every category with the sole exception of construction, where we continued to make progress in the workout of our residential construction book.", "Please turn to slide 14 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio view of asset quality illustrates our fourth quarter improvement in both charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies. While trends showed improvement, absolute asset quality issues remained centered in the residential real estate related portfolios, including residential mortgages, home equity products, and residential construction.", "The commercial portfolio continues to perform reasonably well overall. Commercial loan charge-offs, early-stage delinquency and non-performing loans all declined in the quarter. We continued to see stress in more cyclically sensitive industries, and our small business portfolio with improvements in large corporate. We expect that we could continue to see variability in asset quality in the C&I portfolio from quarter-to-quarter due to the nature of the investment grade portfolio.", "The commercial real estate portfolio, including owner-occupied and income producing properties is performing satisfactorily overall. The charge-off ratio in the quarter declined to single digit basis points, where it was during the first half of the year. While early-stage delinquency improved slightly.", "As a reminder, the majority of charge-offs last quarter related to one loan secured by an owner-occupied property to a manufacturer supplying the auto industry. Non-performing commercial real estate loans increased in the quarter to just over $400 million, or 2.6% of the portfolio. The increase incurred in a variety of property types, including office and hotel.", "Additionally, all of the increase was in smaller loans with the largest being $7 million. Given conditions in the commercial real estate market, we expect stress and credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also expect it to perform relatively well given its composition. We continue to monitor this portfolio closely, and are proactively working with clients to strengthen loan structures and to address future maturities as appropriate.", "Asset quality in the consumer portfolio has held up well in the quarter, especially given that the fourth quarter is a typically seasonally weak time of the year. Charge-offs and early-stage delinquencies were stable to declining in almost all of our non-residential secured consumer portfolios.", "The only exception was in the consumer-direct portfolio, which is largely comprised of federally guaranteed or privately insured loans that caused the increase. Excluding student loans, the early-stage delinquency ratio for the consumer direct portfolio was 107 basis points.", "I\u2019m going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now I will summarize. Home equity performance improved slightly as charge-offs declined while early-stage delinquency rolled back to the second quarter level.", "Charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio dropped 14% on declining frequency and stable severity, while early-stage delinquencies continued to decline. Construction charge-offs trended up again after nearly doubling in the third quarter as we continue to aggressively work through the problem credits in our residential construction portfolio.", "Next I\u2019m going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail, beginning with the residential mortgage portfolio on slide 15. The residential mortgage portfolio continued to show signs of stabilization during the fourth quarter. Although on an absolute basis, this portfolio continues to perform poorly.", "Annualized charge-offs in the fourth quarter, were 4.4%, and non-accrual loans continued to increase. However, charge-offs declined in the quarter, non-accruals increased at a slower pace, and 60 day-plus delinquencies remained stable.", "The trends we\u2019ve noted in past quarters continued this quarter. Specifically, Florida-based loans comprise roughly a third of the portfolio, and contribute to well over half of the asset-quality issues. Also, balances in most of the higher-risk portfolios continue to runoff.", "Overall, deterioration continued to slow. With fourth quarter results augmenting last quarter\u2019s perspective that asset quality may be stabilizing, at least from a frequency perspective. However, we continue to expect sustained softness in jobs across our markets, and weakness in home values, particularly in Florida.", "These expectations suggest that loss severities may increase while frequency of loss declines. Our outlook for charge-offs in this portfolio is an expectation that the level of charge-offs will remain elevated for at least the next two quarters, and may increase depending upon home price stability and unemployment levels.", "Moving to home equity lines on slide 16; over two-thirds of the home equity line core portfolio is performing relatively well. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by the highest risk, 30% of the portfolio. Third-party originated, Florida, and higher loan to value in general.", "These higher-risk segments continued to decline, as they\u2019re in runoff with little line availability and no new production. Overall, this portfolio was displayed stable or better asset quality metrics for all segments. However, this continues to be a portfolio under stress, and we believe losses will remain elevated at least in the short run.", "Now if you will turn to slide 17, I will talk about our construction portfolio. As expected, and continuing a multi-quarters trend, balances declined by 10% again this quarter to $6.6 billion, or 6% of our total loan portfolio. Construction to perm portfolio balances and non-performers continued to wind down, as new production remains minimal and workouts continue on the non-performers.", "Residential builder charge-offs increased again this quarter, as we continue to manage the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. As a result, non-performing loans declined somewhat again this quarter. Perhaps more importantly, 30 days plus delinquency declined significantly again this quarter.", "This means that the inflow of new problem loans declined and as further evidence of progress in resolving the risk in the residential builder portfolio. At this point, we believe that the residential builder portfolio non-performing loans are at or near their peak. The vast majority of the problem loans in the portfolio has been identified and is in the workout process.", "We expect related charge-offs will remain elevated, but declining over the next two to three quarters. Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances decline, charge-offs and non-performers increased modestly, and delinquency declined significantly in the quarter.", "Please turn to slide 18 for an update on allowance in non-performing loans. While non-performing loan levels are not an input into our allowance process, the ratio of allowance to non-performers is a commonly used metric in assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve.", "We provide this disclosure again this quarter as our coverage ratio was below some other banks. This is due to our asset quality issues being skewed towards consumer loans secured by residential real estate in the judicial foreclosure state of Florida. Given the extended time lengths to foreclose in Florida, on average 18 to 24 months, we expect our NPL levels will remain elevated throughout 2010.", "As a reminder, this slide incorporates the analysis of residential mortgage and details that is included in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation into a framework that includes our FAS 114 reserves. The result of this analysis is that our allowance coverage of non-performing loans increases from 59% to 113%, when you factor in the impact of mortgages that have been through the write-down process, and launch with specific reserves.", "The base coverage ratio has improved each of the last two quarters. A table of the FAS 114 reserves for commercial loans by business segment is also included on this slide. We\u2019ve included this detail to provide you some perspective on the level of specific reserves and implied severities in our larger impaired loans, while overall implied severity varies by business segment, the average is 34%.", "Please turn to slide 19 for a review of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting trouble debt restructures, or TDRs. First I\u2019d like to note that 97% of these TDRs are first and second lien residential mortgages, and home equity lines of credit, not commercial or commercial real estate loans.", "Also, as a reminder from last quarter, we are aggressively pursuing modifications when there is a reasonable chance that the modification will allow the client to continue to remain in their home. When there has been a loss of income, such that the client cannot reasonably support even a modified loan, we are strongly encouraging short sales and deed and lieu arrangements and relocation to more affordable housing.", "Dollar growth in total TDRs in the fourth quarter was roughly equivalent to the growth in the third quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, accruing TDRs totaled $1.6 billion, up $330 million, or 22% from the third quarter. Non-accruing TDRs were $913 million, up $236 million or 35% from the third quarter. While three-fourths of the growth in TDRs last quarter was accruing TDRs, this quarter 45% of the increase was in the accruing category.", "We\u2019ve chosen to provide more detail on our modification efforts and results this quarter, so please turn to slide 20 for more on this topic, the table on these slide shows that 70% of our TDRs are current and an additional 14% are in early stage delinquency. Note that accruing TDRs consist of TDRs where the account was accruing at the time of the modification or where the account was non-accruing at the time of the modification and the account has completed its peer period.", "New mortgage and consumer TDRs during the fourth quarter totaled roughly $545 million, of which 55% were for seriously delinquent loans in non-accrual status. These TDRs will continue to be reported as non-accruing until they go through the six-month cure period.", "22% of modifications in the quarter were for clients who were current on principal and interest payments while the remaining accounts were in early-stage delinquency. In the fourth quarter, the vast majority of our new mortgage TDRs included both reduced rates and term spending.", "The final discussion point on this topic relates to the requirement to establish specific FAS 114 reserves for TDRs. Our FAS 114 reserve at 12/31 for TDRs was $343 million. In addition, we have already reported $140 million in charge-offs on the non-accruing TDRs, and also have $86 million mark-to-market adjustment on TDRs carried at fair value.", "The sum of these amounts has already run through the income statement and equates to 20% of the original balance of all TDRs and nearly 75% of the non-current TDR balances. With this level of reserves and write-downs on a largely current portfolio, that is predominantly first lien residential real estate, we believe the potential for future incremental loss is low.", "I\u2019ll summarize the key points from today\u2019s credit update before turning this call back over to Steve. Please turn to slide 21. Overall, asset quality is beginning to stabilize, albeit at relatively high levels of non-performing loans and charge-offs. During the quarter, net charge-offs, non-performing loans, and early stage delinquencies all declined.", "Improvements in charge-offs and delinquencies were broad based among the portfolios. The allowance for loan losses increased to $3.1 billion or 2.76% of loans. We continue to work through the risk inherent in residential mortgage, home equity and builder portfolios. We\u2019re making progress on these higher-risk portfolios as balances decline and asset quality metrics stabilize.", "Our view of allowance coverage of non-performing loans continues to improve as the level of non-performing loans was stable, while the allowance increased. Pace of mortgage modifications continued in the fourth quarter and at the end of the quarter, over two-thirds of the modified loans were current in principal and interest.", "Although fourth quarter charge-offs came in at the low end of our loss forecast, our overall outlook for credit losses remains consistent with the view expressed last quarter. At the current time we expect charge-offs to increase in the first quarter from fourth quarter levels, but we do not expect it to reach third quarter 2009 levels.", "Further, we believe charge-offs will vary around this level in the second quarter with a possibility that improvement will begin at some point in the second half of 2010, depending upon the strength and pace of economic recovery.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.", "Steve Shriner", "Thanks, Tom. We\u2019re ready to take some questions now and in order to accommodate as many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. With that, operator, we\u2019re ready to take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Scott Valentin - FBR.", "Scott Valentin - FBR", "With regard to TARP payment, you mentioned you have sufficient cash and capital to repay TARP. Can you give us some guidance or an indication on the timing of that and maybe also what other alternatives would there be to repaying TARP would you consider keeping TARP if there\u2019s an assisted transaction or something like that?", "Jim Wells", "The facts are that we are balancing regulatory matters and shareholder matters as best we can and intend to continue to do that. The world changes radically and so we\u2019re trying to be certain that we are thinking about it in a complete way while being very sensitive to what the shareholder risk might or might not be. At the same time, financially observed in others who have repaid it financially given the coupon, whatnot it is the desirable thing to do, but we\u2019re not certain when we\u2019ll do it. We need to have the stars and moon aligns and then we\u2019ll proceed from there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "I appreciate all of the detail about credit quality, but I guess if I think about what you had said on the 3Q call and then at the Boston conference about charge-offs likely being stable for the next couple of quarters versus this quarter\u2019s decline. Was there any one thing, lower severities or a particular geography just being better or workouts being more successful, is this one thing or theme that drove the charge-offs this quarter?", "Tom Freeman", "I wish it was that easy. It was actually across all of the portfolios in our expectation and realization of the charge-offs. It came in at the lower end of the forecast, that was in our large commercial portfolios and then with the fall in delinquencies in previous quarters, and tier rates in the consumer side of the portfolio, we picked up momentum.", "I think that was pretty good against all of the portfolios, which were a little surprising, I think that everything got better all at the same time. That doesn\u2019t mean that going forward, we don\u2019t have some fairly large charge-offs to take specifically as we work through our Florida residential real estate portfolio.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs", "If I could ask one follow-up on the mortgage repurchase trends. Again, thank you for the slide. It\u2019s actually more data than I think anyone has put out so far. I guess, the question would be, when you look at the ending balance at $200 million, what is the right denominator to compare that to? Do you think about that relative to your current loss experience, relative to the pending requests, relative to the total loans sold in the 2007 vintage? I mean, what should we compare that to?", "Mark Chancy", "This is Mark Chancy, let me start, maybe Bill Rogers will add some. I think you\u2019re going down the right path, the kind of analysis we\u2019re doing is on a vintage-by-vintage basis. In terms of the reserve, we\u2019re looking at the delinquent loans and then running a roll rate model to try to identify, what we think will roll into not only delinquency, but ultimate loss position, what the level of repurchase requests might be by vintage, the level of success rate if you will, in terms of our repurchases and then the loss severity on those individual loans by vintage.", "We have provided the data that shows a pretty significant difference between the underlying credit, and underwriting statistics associated with each of those years of vintage, the repurchase request now coming increasingly from newer vintages with better underwriting guidelines.", "So as you extrapolate that forward, we are making an estimate with much better data and a more granular analysis around what the current losses are within that portfolio to determine that reserve and we\u2019ve given you a little bit of information around our expectation for charge-offs, which is that they will remain at this kind of elevated level for the next couple of quarters, although we\u2019re not expecting a significant increase in the reserve at this point, given the information that we have and the trend line that we\u2019re on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Usdin - Bank of America Securities.", "Ken Usdin - Bank of America Securities", "I just wanted to ask in terms of reserve build, expectations, looking ahead. The reserve build was a little bigger than it had been in the third quarter, but fairly consistent with what you\u2019ve been doing. Given your comments about charge-offs needing to step up a little bit, and then maybe from this quarter\u2019s level to the next few quarters, and your presumption that things could start to improve in the second half. Where are you in your view of where you stand on your reserve and incremental additions from here?", "Mark Chancy", "This is Mark Chancy and then Tom Freeman may add. The reserve build actually for the allowance itself was lower than in prior quarters. If you go back to the third quarter, I think the number was about $128 million. The reserve build in the fourth quarter was $96 million.", "We did include in the provision expense the incremental reserve build associated with the unfunded commitments reserve and when you aggregate that increase of $57 million with the ALLL increase of $96 million, you get to a number of $153 million, and that may be what you\u2019re comparing to last quarter\u2019s $128 million.", "So I think the correct comparison is $128 million to $96 million, so it\u2019s actually on a downward trend. We did increase the unfunded commitments reserve, and that was related, in part, to a large corporate credit that did not charge off during the course of the fourth quarter, but we added to the reserves both on balance sheet as well as off balance sheet.", "Ken Usdin - Bank of America Securities", "My second question is just, maybe Jim, if you could touch on Florida, just generally speaking. Underlying trends you\u2019re seeing there economically and from a real estate and business activity perspective?", "Jim Wells", "It\u2019s actually it remains spotty depending on where you are in Florida. The reality is that the home sales are doing better than they have been, the continuation of the third quarter trend and the fourth quarter, I think was there. The tourist dollars are less than anyone would like, but in terms of volume of visitors to the parks and whatnot, the volumes are up, the dollars are down, as is true in that industry across the country and maybe the world for that matter.", "Home values, I think we maybe at some inflection point here, because depending on which home valuation service it is you pay attention to you get different answers about the decline rates, 2010 versus 2009 and I think at this point it\u2019s now devolving into, it depends on what the property is, it is under $0.5 million home, is it near the beach, is it in the middle of what used to be an Orange Grove in the center of the state, and those kinds of specific and detailed things. So from a general matter, it\u2019s better, it\u2019s not great yet, but it\u2019s better.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nancy Bush - NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Some regulatory questions, Jim, I realize this is probably going to be tough to answer, and I kind of think I know the answer in advance, but I need to ask the question anyway. Given the credit outlook that you\u2019ve put forth here, it looks like there are still loss quarters to come at least for the next several quarters. Have you gotten any indications from the regulators about whether you will be able to payback TARP while you are still in a loss position?", "Jim Wells", "All we are talking about publicly, as I\u2019m sure you do know, which is why you asked the question the way you did, Nancy, is that the guidance that came out in June about one who wants to pay TARP back, there are obviously shareholder dilution issues in some aspects of that. The guideline is just that, and I think if you analyze those who repaid it recently, what you see is a high variation and how it actually worked and what it meant, and what the math was.", "So what we are trying to do, as I said earlier is to balance regulatory issues, future capital ratios, obviously and the shareholder aspect of this as best we can. You can be sure that there are constant viewers of the way the world is working and at this point, I think we\u2019re sort of thinking about it in the right way. We\u2019ll just to have seen how it plays out.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Secondly, given yesterday\u2019s new rules, whatever they maybe, do you see anything that would impact your company in there, particularly with regard to the coming period of consolidation in the industry?", "Jim Wells", "Obviously, I\u2019m not sure I understand it exactly, I don\u2019t think anyone does. So if we projected what it might mean ultimately, which is a long time from now, I think in terms of actually knowing anything about it. You would have to believe that those who are more heavily weighted to proprietary trading and those sorts of things than we are would be more affected by it. ", "We have a very nice client focused business as you know Nancy, as that\u2019s what we have been trying to do for a period of time, and my guess is it wouldn\u2019t have much impact on that. SO we do a very little, certainly on a relative basis deep proprietary trading.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Goldberg - Barclays.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays", "We\u2019ve seen, I guess improvement in early stage delinquencies the last several quarters, I guess NPAs and restructures have continued to increase. Can you talk about the dynamics of those two, what is I guess is their lag effect? How long that lag typically is or maybe that\u2019s not the best way to look at it?", "Jim Wells", "Maybe I could offer an alternative sort of view of this. As we\u2019ve been talking about the TDRs and the compositions of TDRs over the past couple of quarters, while the delinquencies are declining, our restructuring efforts are getting, we\u2019ve gone through the inventory of severely delinquent loans to a large extent. Our methodology and analytics have gotten increasingly proactive to try to identify people early in their issues. So that don\u2019t get in so much financial trouble that we can\u2019t get them through their issues. ", "As you look at the composition of the workout streams, we\u2019re actually reaching deeper and deeper in to our current queues for folks that need some help in identifying that they\u2019ve got problems or restructuring requirements. That\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re trying to indicate in those slides that we\u2019ve begun to put in there.", "Jason Goldberg - Barclays", "Secondly, sorry if I missed this, in terms of the tax rate for the quarter, I guess adjusting for some of the noise. It still looked like it was relatively low. I guess anything else in there and just maybe give some guidance to go forward?", "Mark Chancy", "As far as guidance going forward, obviously in this environment, we have been in a loss position, and you have certain permanent tax differences. You have items that are in our income stream that are municipal interest, for example. You have tax planning strategies, both at the state and Federal level that have been implemented and get reserved periodically.", "We have several of those planning sessions come to fruition during the course of 2009 as the years were reserved with the taxing authorities, all of those various variables affect the tax rate in a given period. So at this point, we\u2019re not providing any specific guidance as we move in to 2010. There wasn\u2019t any large transaction resolved in the fourth quarter that drove a specific tax rate. There were some smaller favorable adjustments that occurred during the course of the fourth quarter, but nothing significant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Just on the trust and investment management and the asset management business. Just wondering were there any performance fees or prop gains in the fourth quarter number? You picked up a lot, and I\u2019m wondering is there anything offsetting that comp? ", "Bill Rogers", "This is Bill Rogers. There were some perform related fees in the fourth quarter that accounted for that.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Can you quantify that at all? Was that mostly the delta?", "Bill Rogers", "No, it was really about probably, a little less than half of the total increase.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Was any of that offsetting comp, because normally about half of that will close to the comp?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, and there\u2019s a corresponding, if you go down a lot bit, corresponding increase in comp related to that performance base.", "Mark Chancy", "This is Mark Chancy, I mentioned the quarter-over-quarter expense in increase in personnel with items like that that drove the increase.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Then just a quick question, do you disclose your six months redefault rate? I love the disclosure you have on slide 20, but I\u2019m wondering what that redefault rate was on the TDRs?", "Mark Chancy", "Don\u2019t disclose it, but of the reasons for that was the lack of industry standardization around the method of calculation makes it very difficult to put a number out that could be compared correctly on a company-over-company basis, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we don\u2019t make that public.", "Steve Shriner", "We\u2019re closing in on the top of the hour. So we\u2019ll take one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O\u2019Neill.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Just wondering if you should we be looking at the trading account profits that declined nicely link quarter and I guess largely because of lower market valuation losses. Should we expect that to continue or given the environment are we kind of probably going to stay at a certain level.", "Just wondering if you could just address quickly the deferred tax asset issue, which you mention in the release that you went from a DTL position to a small DTA position? Does that put you guys anymore at risk of having to write that down at some point in the future? Thanks.", "Steve Shriner", "Kevin, this is Steve. Kind of the core trading as you know has been a little volatile. It\u2019s been on a down trend. That was basically driven by core client activity such as equity and fixed income derivatives volume in our client business. In terms of where that\u2019s going to go in the future, clearly interest rate volatility and stock market volatility tends to increase transaction volume. So if you have a view of that, you would tend to think that trading is going to be flat from where it is to up, but probably not down again. I\u2019m going to let Mark address specifically the DTA question.", "Mark Chancy", "This is Mark Chancy. The DTA number for Federal was $25 million, and I think was the net. So it was a very modest change if you will, and increased in the DTA. The increase was driven, actually by a change in our OCI that was correlated. We have some received fixed swaps that have been deeply in the money, and with marginal change and increase in rates, the AOCI was reduced and that affected the calculation.", "There is no valuation reserve that is warranted in connection with our Federal, and we have a modest valuation reserve that has already been established in connection with our state DTAs. So the bottom line answer to your question is, no. We do not anticipate at this point, the need for a valuation reserve on our Federal and there\u2019s a little bit of noise in terms of the relevant change because of things like variations in OCI.", "Steve Shriner", "Thank you, everybody; we appreciate you all joining us this morning.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

(Operator instruction) I would like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Steve Shriner, the Director of Investor Relations.", "Steve Shriner ", "", "Good morning, welcome to SunTrust\u2019s first quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. ", "In addition to the press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics today. Slide two outlines the content, which includes an overview of the quarter, financial results discussion and a credit review. The press release presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, which is www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "", "With me today, among other members of our Executive Management team, are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer; Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter, Mark will then discuss financial performance and Tom will conclude with the review of asset quality. At the conclusion of formal remarks, we will open the session for questions.", "", "Before we get started, I need to remind that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filing, which are also available on our website. Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made and we disclaim any responsibility to do so. ", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on the website. ", "", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.", "", "With that, I will turn it over to Jim.", "", "Jim Wells", "", "Good morning, everyone. Glad you are with us this morning. Our first quarter results improved to a loss of $0.46 versus a loss of $0.64 last quarter as earnings continued to be impacted by elevated credit costs. ", "While overall home price depreciation slowed uncertainty remains around the direction of future home prices, especially in certain markets. Revenue remains soft driven by a decline in mortgage production volume coupled with mark to market losses on our fair value, publically held debt. Also, loan demand has yet to pick up as clients have focused on capital preservation and debt reduction and have accessed the debt markets in lieu of bank loans. ", "However, as the economy has shown signs of improvement and so have our results. The most notable sign of improvement was in asset quality which resulted in the significant decrease in credit related costs compared to last quarter. Charge offs remain stable compared to the fourth quarter though if you exclude the actions that Tom Freeman will detail later in the call charge offs would have declined sequentially. Additionally, nonperforming assets, the allowance for loan losses and 90 plus delinquencies were all stable quarter to quarter while provision expense for nonperforming loans and early stage delinquencies all decreased. ", "We believe this marks a continuation of improved asset quality trends as the improvements in charge offs and delinquencies were broad based among the portfolios and we experienced the second sequential quarter of overall positive asset quality metrics. In addition the apparent beginning of economic improvement, our client focused strategies, lower cost deposit mix and expense management discipline also contributed to encouraging operating trends. ", "Favorable deposit mix trends continued this quarter with growth in money market balances and a decrease in higher cost time deposits. After an extended period of growth consumer and commercial deposits were stable, a trend one would expect with economic improvement. However, we are improving client satisfaction in getting to the drivers that build loyalty by understanding individual preferences and aligning our business model to respond in a fashion that is improving client satisfaction and retention. ", "The net interest margin increased due largely to our ability to shift our funding mix to lower cost deposits and to improve loan pricing. Stable client deposits and improved mix enabled the reduction in higher cost sources of funding and that, along with lower rates paid, pushed the margin higher. The result of disciplined expense management was evident across controlling operating expenses again this quarter. We continue to capitalize on the strength we have built and remain focused on continually covering efficiency improvement opportunities. And those cycle costs including other real estate and credit and collection costs are collectively high they are down significantly from the prior quarter as from the same quarter of last year. ", "What this all comes down to is the positive results from improved economic conditions and our continuing efforts are reflected in various aspects of core performance. Notable examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, the impact of asset liability management actions on margin and expense management. We remain focused on uncovering opportunities to improve execution across the organization as we seek to increase client satisfaction to grow our core business. ", "Turning to slide four I will spend a moment discussing our capital position before turning the call over to Mark. As you can see, slide four depicts our current estimated capital ratios and book value per share. We maintain a solid capital position with an estimated Tier 1 common rate of 7.65% and a Tier 1 ratio exceeding 13%. We continue to have substantial liquidity as deposit inflows have been largely retained in cash and invested in high quality, government-backed securities. Book value was $35.40 and tangible common was $22.76 at the close of the quarter. ", "Our position on TARP repayment remains unchanged. We are well positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time. Separately, last week we announced we are exploring options relating to RidgeWorth. We are simply continuing our longstanding practice of evaluating ways to manage our business mix to maximize value for our shareholders. This evaluation does not apply to the majority of our wealth management business and is not tied to any movement on our part to repay TARP. Even if we do move forward with the transaction the impact would not be material enough to have a significant effect on our capital planning or our financial results. ", "To conclude we believe that as economic recovery continues to gain traction our strong capital position and level of liquidity will enable us to operate from a position of strength to capitalize on opportunities in the markets and businesses in which we compete and to drive improved shareholder value. We are increasingly encouraged by current operating trends and our outlook for the future. ", "There are a number of factors, some internal and some external, that cause us to believe the worst is behind us. As economic recovery seems certain, the remaining uncertainty relates primarily to the pace and strength of the economic improvement and its lingering impact on home prices. Our positive asset quality and operating trends give us reason to be optimistic about our performance as 2010 progresses. Our strong foundation coupled with our client focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities and the long-term economic prospects of our markets position us to deliver improving financial performance. ", "I would like to turn the call over to Mark now. ", "Mark Chancy ", "", "Thanks Jim and good morning everybody. I will begin my comments today on slide five of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. ", "For the quarter we posted a loss for common shareholders of $229 million or $0.46 per share. As has been the case in recent quarters the loss was driven by elevated charge offs, cyclically sensitive expenses and to a lesser extent soft revenue generation in certain units. The effects of the recession also continued to impact our results. Loan demand remained weak. Mortgage production volume declined significantly versus 2009 levels and noninterest income declined sequentially in a number of our larger line items. ", "However, the amount of the reported loss declined significantly compared to last quarter. Improved results were largely due to lower provision and noninterest expenses, lower mortgage repurchase reserves and a stable net interest margin. Overall, the improvement in our results is occurring coincident with the recovering economy and some of the positive trends are primarily related to the environment. On the other hand we are directly driving the improvement in many areas. ", "Notable and visible examples of our success include deposit mix and pricing, expense management and the impact of asset liability management actions on net interest margin. Less noticeable now but critically important to our future is our increasing success in attracting and retaining clients with improved service and innovative products and services. ", "So with that brief summary of first quarter results I will now shift to slide 6 and a balance sheet review. Overall, average loan balances excluding nonaccruals declined 1% and 11% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. The decline in balances in our higher risk categories continue. Construction balances continued their rapid decline, down another 14% in the current quarter and down 45% compared to last year. The resident mortgage and home equity line portfolios also continued their downward trends. ", "Commercial and industrial loans reversed trend and increased slightly. However, the increase was due to bringing an average of $1.4 billion back on the balance sheet as a result of FAS 167. Excluding this impact, C&I continued this downward trend although the pace of decline slowed considerably. Line of credit utilization among our larger corporate and mid-sized clients now averages 21% for our largest clients and 33% for our midsized clients. ", "While these utilization rates are down over 10 percentage points and 5 percentage points respectively the decline in this quarter was only 2 percentage points for larger clients and was stable for our mid-sized clients. We are hopeful that borrowing by credit worthy clients will stabilize soon and then pick back up in the second half of the year but our belief at this point is based largely on the slowing pace of decline and anecdotal information from dialogue with our clients. ", "Now moving onto deposits at the bottom of the slide you can see core deposits declined slightly. However, please note the positive shift in mix continued. Lower cost deposit volumes increased as the small declines in DDA and NOW driven by seasonal commercial client activity were more than offset by growth in money market balances. The overall reduction in deposit balances was driven by CD balances which similar to last quarter were allowed to decline. We also reduced average broker and foreign deposits by $1.7 billion in the quarter or 33%. ", "Our current liquidity position has enabled us to take the actions I just mentioned to refine and lower the cost of our funding profile. We also took actions with our securities portfolio so please turn to slide 7 for a brief review of the available for sale portfolio securities. ", "The portfolio continues to be concentrated in higher quality and very liquid assets. Government and agency securities in the first four rows are the bulk of the portfolio with the Treasuries being held in anticipation of ultimate TARP repayment. The other equity holdings are largely [Coke], Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Bank stock.  ", "During the quarter we decreased our holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities and increased our asset backed securities position. The overall portfolio grew significantly in 2009 due to the strong inflow of deposits and declining loan demand. Given what appears to be an improving economy and a higher probability we are moving closer to an increasing rate environment we began to take action to reduce our longer term securities exposure. ", "Specifically we sold $2 billion in mortgage backed securities during the quarter. Additionally, for similar purposes and in order to better diversify our portfolio we sold U.S. agency debt and purchased asset backed securities. The new ABS securities are high quality and are backed by newly originated consumer automobile loans. We will continue to take actions that best balance our excess liquidity against returns while retaining maximum flexibility to respond to changes in the market environment. ", "I will now take a moment to talk about the margin on slide 8. Net interest margin expanded slightly this quarter increasing by five basis points to 3.32%. We had originally expected some margin compression in the quarter driven by off balance sheet consolidations, the full impact of the relatively low yielding U.S. Treasury securities and an expectation of declining deposits. However, deposit volume, mix and pricing combined with improved loan pricing largely offset the negative impacts such that day count was the largest driver of margin expansion during the quarter. ", "As we look out into the second quarter and beyond we do not expect additional margin expansion in the near-term. In fact, day count benefit reversal combined with scenario analysis around some of the key variables such as loan and deposit volumes, pricing and market interest rates suggests margin could trend down slightly in the second quarter. For the second quarter and the remainder of the year we are currently expecting margin to be relatively stable within a range around 3.25%. ", "Moving to slide 9 and provision expense, Tom will cover credit in detail in just a minute so I am going to be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $862 million, down $112 million from the fourth quarter. Charge offs of $821 million in the quarter are approximately equal to the fourth quarter level. Please note the increase in the charge off ratio is therefore purely driven by lower outstanding loan balances. Charge offs this quarter include two actions totaling $182 million that Tom will review in detail in a few minutes. The reason I mention it now is to make the point that if these additional steps had not been taken during the quarter net charge offs would have declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. ", "The increase in the allowance for loan losses was $56 million in the quarter compared to $96 million in the fourth quarter which brings the allowance to $3.2 billion and 2.8% of loans. The reserve was relatively stable including a reduction in the reserve for unfunded commitments. Despite the notable improvement in asset quality the allowance remained relatively stable for the time being as the outlook for economic improvement and home values remains uncertain. ", "Now moving onto noninterest income on slide 10, noninterest income in the quarter was down 6% and down 38% as compared to last quarter and last year respectively. After adjustments for certain items in each quarter noninterest income actually increased by 4% and then declined 28% respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains and as in prior quarters we have provided the underlying detail for those adjustments in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation. ", "In the quarter the largest adjustments are for fair value securities marks and a $20 million loss associated with our fair value debt and related hedges as SunTrust\u2019s credit spread continued to tighten. The primary reason for the adjusted year-over-year decline in noninterest income is a roughly $280 million reduction in mortgage production income driven by a nearly 60% decline in origination volume. Income was also negatively affected by $100 million increase in mortgage, rep and warranty costs on a year-over-year basis. ", "On a sequential basis the increase in noninterest income is mostly due to mortgage related revenues. Rep and warranty costs which are included in mortgage production income declined by $92 million and mortgage servicing income increased primarily due to the performance of the NSR asset and our related hedges. Additionally, core trading income improved sequentially driven by increased fixed income sales and trading client revenues and improved performance in corporate treasury. ", "Sequential revenue declines were reported in Trust and Investment Management income and in service charges on deposit accounts. Trust income declined primarily due to annual performance fees reported in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decline in service charge revenue was driven by a lower rate of NSF OD incidences in the quarter. We are actively engaged in analyzing and preparing to implement required changes to our service charge practices as required by Reg E on July 1st. ", "Based on different scenarios for client opt-in we could see a reduction in our overall service and charge income of 10-20% during the second half of this year. We also believe the initial reduction in fee income will be greater in the first quarter or two after implementation as clients continue to opt-in and as we in the industry develop new and enhanced products and services. ", "Now please turn to slide 11 and more detail around the mortgage rep and warranty repurchase trends we provide. This slide depicts the mortgage rep and warranty related trends. This is the same information presented last quarter, updated with first quarter results. The top left portion of this slide highlights the increasing impact on earnings and growth in the reserve during 2009. In the first quarter of 2010 the reserve increased only slightly but charge offs declined significantly. ", "Specifically, the line item labeled \u201cAdditions\u201d represents the cost reported as a reduction to mortgage production income in the quarter and you can see the cost declined to $128 million in the first quarter as compared to $220 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The charge offs recognized in the first quarter declined to $118 million or $10 million less than the additions to the reserve. This resulted in a modest increase in the overall reserve to $210 million. ", "The graph on the right illustrates why losses declined and reserves were stable. New request volume declined in the quarter and the inventory of pending requests continued its decline. While we are pleased that new request volume declined it is not clear to us how much of the decline may be related to seasonality, sustainable cyclical factors or simply agency work flows. ", "As a result, we are not expecting new request volumes to decline significantly in the near-term. On the bottom left of this slide you can see the vintage of repurchase requests was basically stable on a sequential basis with most of the volume coming from higher loss vintages in 2007 and prior. We do expect that normal, seasoning patterns for origination vintages will continue to shift new request volume to newer vintages over time. ", "On the bottom right are some key statistics that illustrate the lower risk profile of the newer vintages. Lower levels of Alt-A, higher FICO and the higher percentage of full doc loans in newer vintages suggests lower frequency of losses. Newer vintages exhibit lower LTVs and were originated during and after a period of significant home price depreciation. This suggests that in addition to lower frequency of loss new vintages will experience lower loss severity as well. ", "In conclusion, near-term losses and reserve levels will largely be driven by the volume of new repurchase requests. While new request volumes are difficult to predict if they stabilize at first quarter levels we expect charge offs and reserves to decline gradually over the remainder of 2010 as the shift to newer vintages naturally occurs. However, if new request volumes increase and/or older vintage request volumes remain high charge offs and reserves could remain at current levels of even higher. ", "Now turning to slide 12 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense declined 37% when compared to the first quarter of 2009 and 6% compared to last quarter. On this slide we have adjusted for some items that are detailed in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation. There were no large adjustments during the current quarter. A large adjustment in the first quarter of last year was primarily related to goodwill impairment. ", "Excluding certain adjustments expenses were down 5% compared to last year and down 4% compared to last quarter. We have included an analysis of the key items impacting the comparison. The total year-over-year decrease in adjusted expenses is approximately $64 million. Reductions in credit related and pension expenses contributed to the positive expense performance as they declined year-over-year while FDIC related expenses clearly increased. The net of these three items is a $54 million decrease in expenses and the expense change net of these items is a decrease of $10 million noted at the bottom. ", "This means that excluding special items and cyclically sensitive expenses the net of all other expenses is down slightly on a year-over-year basis. The conclusion of the sequential quarter analysis is exactly the same. ", "So the highlights of what I have discussed this morning are that; one, our earnings loss has narrowed. Two, the provision expense declined due to improved asset quality. Three, margin increased despite weak loan demand driven by a continued shift in our funding mix to lower cost deposits. Four, noninterest income remains soft though improved versus last quarter in part due to a decline in mortgage rep and warranty costs. Finally, noninterest expenses have declined as cyclically sensitive expenses are lower and we have managed all other expenses tightly. ", "We are encouraged by current operating and operating trends. The remaining questions are related to how quickly and strongly the economy recovers and where home prices will trend from here. At this time we are looking forward to continued improvement in our results as 2010 progresses. ", "With that I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality. ", "Tom Freeman ", "", "Thanks Mark. This morning I am going to review our asset quality beginning on slide 13. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early state delinquencies all decreased. Additionally, charge offs, the allowance for loan losses and 90 plus delinquencies were all stable quarter to quarter. ", "A couple of numbers on this slide were influenced by actions we took in the quarter related to nonperforming loans. While overall charge offs were flat quarter-over-quarter at $821 million the base level of charge offs was lower. Added to this lower base were incremental charge offs on aged residential mortgage nonperformers resulting from a change in policy. We also decided to sell a portfolio of mortgage loans and as a result reduced nonperforming loans and recorded an incremental charge off. I will address these actions in more detail later in the presentation. ", "Please turn to slide 14 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio review of asset quality illustrates broad based improvement in early stage delinquencies among the consumer portfolios. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement in early stage delinquencies. Overall, charge offs remain stable at $821 million with the charge off ratio increasing due purely to a reduction in loan balances. As in past quarter absolute asset quality issues remain centered in the residential real estate related portfolios including residential mortgages, home equity products, land and residential construction. ", "The commercial portfolio continues to perform well overall. Commercial loan charge offs and early stage delinquencies were stable in the quarter and nonperforming loans declined by over $100 million for the third quarter in a row. We continue to see some potential for volatility in more cyclically sensitive industries. However, our view is that overall C&I asset quality is stable and improving at this point in the cycle. ", "Overall commercial real estate portfolio including owner occupied and income producing properties is performing well. The charge off ration in the quarter remained in the single digits and early stage delinquencies were stable. While commercial real estate nonperforming loans increased in the quarter to $464 million they represent a relatively low 3% of the portfolio. ", "Given the conditions in the commercial real estate market we expect additional stress and credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also believe our portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition and the way it was underwritten. As noted a moment ago asset quality improved in the consumer portfolios. Early stage delinquencies declined across most portfolios and charge off ratios were stable to down. ", "The only exceptions were in the residential 1-4 family and credit card portfolios. The 1-4 family charge off ratio increased due to actions we took related to nonperforming loans. The dollar increase in credit card charge offs were $7 million due to one-time timing adjustments associated with bringing credit card servicing in-house. ", "I am going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now I will summarize. Overall home equity performance has been stable as charge offs were generally flat while early stage delinquency declined. Early stage delinquencies declined meaningfully in the mortgage portfolio and the increase in charge offs was entirely related to our decision to sell assets and a change in accounting policy. Construction charge offs declined by almost one-half. We expect more charge offs in this portfolio with uneven quarter to quarter results due to the nature of the workout process. However, I can assure you we are aggressively pursuing a resolution of nonperformers in this portfolio. ", "Next I am going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail beginning with the residential mortgage portfolio on slide 15. Asset quality in the residential mortgage portfolio continued to show improvement in the first quarter although this portfolio continues to perform poorly on an absolute basis. The key point this quarter is that balances were flat and asset quality in the large core portfolio improved. ", "Please note that overall core balances were flat as a result of the repurchase of nearly $500 million in government-guaranteed Ginnie Mae mortgages. In addition, while higher risk segment balances continue to decline asset quality metrics for these portfolios were stable. The impact of our decision to sell assets and a change in our charge off accounting policy on long-dated foreclosures is evident in the asset quality metrics on this slide. However, the improvement in early stage delinquencies noted earlier was not impacted by our actions and as a result our outlook for this portfolio has improved. ", "Early stage delinquency trends indicate a lower frequency of default in the future. Additionally, home price deterioration appears to be slowing in a number of our markets. There remain risks to this outlook. First, sustained softness in jobs among our markets could impact the frequency of loss. Second, loss severity could be negatively impacted by weakness in home values resulting from an influx of foreclosed homes into the market, higher mortgage rates and the elimination of government subsidies for homebuyers. ", "This dynamic is particularly true in Florida. The net result is that while we are optimistic about the future there are market headwinds outside of our control that could negatively impact asset quality. However, even with those risks in mind our outlook for charge offs in the residential mortgage portfolio has improved.  ", "Moving to home equity lines on slide 16, overall the home equity portfolio performance has been relatively stable. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by higher risk segments of the portfolio. Loans that were originated by third-parties, loans in Florida and loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Values in these segments continue to decline due to runoff and charge offs with no new production and little line availability. ", "Core portfolio balances which represent approximately 70% of the HELOC portfolio were basically stable. The core portfolio performed better than the higher risk segments but showed a sequential increase in charge offs in the first quarter of roughly $10 million due to higher losses related to consumer bankruptcies. ", "Now if you turn to slide 17 I will talk about our construction portfolio. Construction balances declined over 13% in the quarter or nearly $900 million. To put this in context, construction balances in 2007 exceeded $14 billion and are now down nearly $9 billion or 60%. Construction to perm portfolio balances and nonperformers continue to run down as new production remains minimal and workout efforts continue on the nonperformers. ", "Residential builder charge offs decreased significantly this quarter due to the uneven nature of timing in the workout process. We continue to aggressively manage the portfolio through foreclosures and workouts. As a result and due to continued variability in land values we expect charge offs in this portfolio to increase next quarter. However, as I just mentioned the basic nature of the process particularly in the judicial foreclosure state of Florida renders timing difficult to gauge with accuracy. ", "This is truly a timing issue, not an income issue, since we continue to be comfortable with the reserves on this portfolio. It is also important to note that 30 days plus delinquency declined significantly again this quarter in the largest portfolios while the [A&D] portfolio segments and the overall portfolio showed increases. In fact, this increase in the overall delinquency ratio was purely a denominator issue since the dollars delinquent declined by $8 million. ", "The [A&D] delinquency increase stands out but the higher ratios are driven by lower balances combined with a small dollar increase in delinquencies. In the [legacy builder A&D] segment delinquent dollars increased by $7 million while the commercial [A&D] increase was due to 15 loans totaling $12 million. Construction related nonperforming loans increased somewhat this quarter. However, we continue to believe that nonperforming loans in the builder portfolio are at or near their peak. ", "The majority of loans in the portfolio that are going to have problems have been identified and are in the workout process. As these workouts progress we expect the related charge offs to increase next quarter and remain elevated and uneven over the remainder of 2010. Credit performance in the commercial construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined significantly, charge offs declined and nonperformers increased only modestly. ", "Please turn to slide 18 where I will cover our nonperforming loan actions we took this quarter. As I noted earlier, we took actions this quarter that impacted the level of nonperforming loans and charge offs. In the table on the left you can see the impact of these actions was to increase charge offs by $182 million over base charge offs of $639 million that we would have reported otherwise. Nonperforming loan balances were reduced by $342 million as a result of these actions. This represents the sum of the held-for-sale carrying balance of $160 million plus $182 million charge off. ", "Let me describe the two actions we took in more detail including our rationale. The first action was a change in our process for reporting charge offs on residential mortgage nonperforming loans. Specifically, we reported $131 million in incremental charge offs on first lien residential mortgage loans that have been in the foreclosure process for more than 12 months. Our previous practice was to charge the loan down to an average of 85% of market value and 180 days past due and not record further charge offs until the final foreclosure. ", "Given the extended foreclosure timeframes particularly in Florida and the decline in value that occurred in collateral values we determined it would be appropriate to record an additional adjustment 12 months after the initial charge off. Our original charge off policy did not envision that foreclosure timeframes would extend well beyond 12 months. Additionally, it makes more sense to make this change now that property values in many markets appear to be stabilized. This action accelerates the timing of when we recognize the potential additional charge offs resulting from foreclosure. ", "The $131 million brings forward charge offs that we would have reported later. We do not believe the impact of this policy adjustment in future quarters will be material. One final note on this topic, the change applies only to residential first lien mortgages primarily held in Florida. ", "The second action in the quarter was the decision to sell $211 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans. As a result, we recorded an incremental charge off of $51 million in the quarter and classified these loans as held-for-sale. We are actively marketing this portfolio and intend to complete the sale in the second quarter. We have chosen to take this action now as liquidity and market pricing for nonperforming mortgage loans has improved as the decline in underlying home values has slowed. ", "The improvement in the market is evidenced by the relatively small additional charge off especially when viewed in light of the concentration of loans in this portfolio that are located in Florida and California. In addition, the size of the portfolio is rather small and allows us to test the market appetite and pricing for various geographic and product profiles. The sale also allows us to better allocate default management resources and avoid the time and expense of long foreclosure timeframes for selected loans. ", "Please turn to slide 19 for a review of our mortgage modification efforts and resulting troubled debt restructures (TDRs). The key point to take away from this slide are that the pace of mortgage modifications has slowed and that 95% of the growth in TDRs in the quarter was in the accruing category. TDRs increased by less than $300 million in the current quarter as compared to over $500 million in each of the previous three quarters. The slower pace of growth is primarily related to a lower inflow of newly delinquent loans and also peer modifications of more seriously delinquent. ", "Non-accruing TDRs increased by $14 million in the quarter as compared to $236 million in the fourth quarter. The last point I would like to make here is that TDRs continue to be almost exclusively first and second lien residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit. Additional detail on the performance of our modified loans is included in the next slide. This table shows 73% of the TDRs are current on all principle and interest payments and an additional 13% are in early stage delinquency. To put this payment status in context, accruing TDR balances totaled $1.3 billion at the end of the third quarter as opposed to $1.9 billion today. This means that over 2/3 of the accruing TDRs have aged at least six months and as you can see on this slide 88% of the accruing TDRs are current on principle and interest payments at the end of March. ", "Our primary means by which these accruing residential TDRs exit the portfolio is through payoff or refinance. The $400 million of current but non-accruing TDRs will continue to be reported as non-accruing until they go through a six month cure period after which they will move into an accruing TDR status. Accruing TDRs that become 120 days past due are moved to a non-accrual TDR status. ", "Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs is continuing to exceed our expectations for the first quarter with 95% of the accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio was much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than it is to a restructured portfolio. Obviously performance on this portfolio could deteriorate, however we are pleased with the performance to date. ", "I will summarize the key points from today\u2019s credit update before turning the call back over to Steve. Please turn to slide 21. Overall, asset quality has improved. However, nonperforming loans and charge offs remain high. During the quarter early stage delinquencies, base charge offs and nonperforming loans all declined. The nonperforming assets were stable. Improvements in base charge offs and delinquencies were broad based among the portfolios. Balances continue to decline and asset quality metrics continued to improve in our consumer residential real estate portfolios. ", "$182 million in incremental charge offs were reported in the quarter for a change in internal policy for aged first mortgage NPLs and for a small portfolio of nonperforming loans that was transferred to held-for-sale. The pace of mortgage modifications slowed considerably in the fourth quarter and the proportion that is current on principle and interest payments increased slightly from last quarter to 73%. ", "At the current time we expect overall second quarter charge offs to be stable to down versus the first quarter. The run rate of base charge offs of roughly $640 million is expected to be stable to slightly up depending on the status of residential construction workouts and the pace of improvement in the consumer portfolios. Of course, if we were to decide to sell additional nonperforming loans that would also influence where we fall within the overall expected range of targets. With that, I will turn it back over to Steve. ", "Steve Shriner", "", "Thanks Tom. Before we take questions I am going to wrap up with some key takeaways from today\u2019s call. We posted a loss in the quarter driven largely by elevated credit costs and soft revenue generation particularly related to loan demand and certain noninterest income items. ", "As you know the impact of the recession on our asset quality and earnings will take awhile to recede. However, the process of improvement now appears to have clearly begun. Asset quality improved again this quarter and leading indicators suggest further improvement during the remainder of the year. Our capital position remains solid. We believe that we have strong capital today and enough capital to leverage for growth as the economy strengthens tomorrow. Liquidity and funding have been well managed as have expenses. Perhaps most importantly we have made a lot of little changes that have improved daily execution, increased accountability and enhanced products and services. ", "We have more work to do here but these actions are gaining momentum and improving client satisfaction. Taken all together these things give us confidence that our earnings power is well leveraged to economic recovery. We are ready to begin taking questions now. In order to accommodate as many as possible I would ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, we are ready for the first question.  ", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse. ", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "It sounds like in your commentary on charge offs the range we should really think about for next quarter is between the base level which was about 639 and a reported level of 821. Is that correct? Would you expect charge offs to really trend closer to the bottom part of that range or the top part of that range given your guidance today? ", "Tom Freeman ", "", "I have trouble with Steve in even defining a range specifically for this reason. I think it will be within the range. I think it has a lot to do with some of the residential restructures we are doing specifically on the homebuilder side and whether or not the opportunity to take any other actions depending upon the secondary markets we are currently seeing out there for the potential sale of further assets. ", "I feel pretty comfortable within the range, but trying to pick where in the range we are going to do is going to depend on what the markets look like over the quarter. ", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "But you hear, to define that question a little better, on the bottom of slide 12 you point out the run rate of base charge offs is expected to be stable to slightly up. That would be off the base of 639. Should we expect another significant level of kind of non-base charge offs related to acceleration of held-for-sale residential mortgages? ", "Steve Shriner ", "", "Really the statement itself in Tom\u2019s prepared comments were designed to kind of focus you on a base rate of charge offs that is stable to slightly up, we have not completed the transaction related to the NPLs and the reason the range is large is we are leaving some optionality for ourselves if that transaction goes well to come back in the market with a second transaction. Does that help? ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank ", "Your [inaudible] margin isn\u2019t improving as much as some other banks we are seeing. I would just point out on page 7 of the deck here your securities book is more liquid than others and it does seem like you are shortening it. It feels like there is some dry powder and I guess if you could just help us put all of this together, when rates start to rise how much leverage is there in the [inaudible] margin? Then take a stab at what a more normal NIM would look like. ", "Mark Chancy ", "", "I think you have it right. We have a fair amount of dry powder. We have reduced our securities portfolio by a couple of billion dollars and our liquidity position is outstanding as we ended the first quarter. Actually a little better, as we said in the prepared remarks, than anticipated given the deposits have maintained their levels and the mix further improved. So we are evaluating the rate environment. We are seeing the economy improve and there is a translation as to when that will affect longer term rates. We are using both on balance sheet securities as well as off balance sheet opportunities like interest rate swaps to manage the duration of the balance sheet. ", "So we will use all of those types of tools to try and manage through what is likely to be a rising rate environment. I will remind you the nonperforming loans affect margin currently by a little over 20 basis points. So that is one element that is a significant headwind that that we are working our way through with current margin around 3.25% to 3.30%. ", "Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank ", "Any more detail on how you are positioned right now? Are you asset sensitive? If rates were to go up would it be listed in NIM? ", "Mark Chancy ", "", "When you look at the various analyses we are relatively neutral. We don\u2019t have any significant asset or liability sensitivities but one of the things we are doing is we are maintaining a very liquid balance sheet to be able to move as the environment changes and in anticipation of a rising rate. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush - NAB Research. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "A quick question on your initial commentary I think on page 3 about uncovering opportunities across the company. Can you just give us some color on that? Is that expense? Is that certain revenue initiatives? ", "Jim Wells ", "", "Actually both. The expense side is we are doing a lot of front to back re-engineering of processes. I think in the mortgage business or several other places that are longer time consumers than some of the shorter term things we have done in the last year or so. We have also done a lot of research and product development sort of work that is going on that we think will enhance revenues. The basic issue obviously is whether or not C&I loan growth or any other sort of loan growth shows up and when does it show up. As a general proposition we have been investing all through this thing both on the expense side in terms of cutting costs and increasing productivity as well as on the revenue side with new products, training and those kinds of expenses. Actually that answer is both. ", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "I would ask as an add-on I was in College Park recently and was astonished to see a new SunTrust branch there. What are the branch development or branch opening plans around Atlanta and is there a number of branches and an expense level we can look at there this year? ", "Jim Wells ", "", "I don\u2019t remember the numbers exactly but over the last 5-6 years we have probably averaged 30-40 or some 50 branches opened and 20-30 closed. So we are constantly dealing with the network to make sure it is in the right places and the mix is in stores of traditional freestanding and store front and what not is proper. We don\u2019t really have a target. We are trying to be opportunistic about this sort of thing. We don\u2019t really have a goal as some people have stated of building X branches over the next year or two. It is not time to think that way I don\u2019t believe. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Betsy Grasek \u2013 Morgan Stanley. ", "Betsy Grasek \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Could you talk a little bit about where you anticipate your normalized NIM and ROA/ROE kind of settling out? ", "Jim Wells ", "", "Mark I think has covered the normalized NIM pretty well. Basically we think it is going to be 3.25 or above, maybe a little below depending on what the asset mix becomes. The ROA issue is traditionally over the decades SunTrust has been sort of a 110 ROA mix of business. My own view is that it is certainly larger than one barring some unforeseen burden placed on us either regulatorily or politically. The, I think, reality is it will be from 1-1.25 for awhile and then we will have to see how it shakes out. ", "ROE, you tell me what the capital ratio is and I will tell you what the ROE is. If you want to tell me I will give you some math here and tell you. ", "Betsy Grasek \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I suppose the questions to follow-up on ROA is the kind of expense ratios you are anticipating and the timeframe to get there. ", "Jim Wells ", "", "It is hard to say because obviously the mix is shifting inside the various businesses which has a great deal to do with an efficiency ratio analysis. The reality is, if you look at the fact for some number of quarters, 4 or 6 or 8 or something like that, we have shown core deposit declines year-over-year each quarter and I think you can assume of the days of the low 60\u2019s efficiency ratio are gone. I think you can also assume we are investing in productivity and efficiency as well as the culture shift that has occurred over the last couple of three years. ", "So I don\u2019t know whether it is mid 50\u2019s or around there somewhere but it is probably something like that. I think we are going to have to shift out some of the mix issues and see where we go. ", "Betsy Grasek \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So that is over the next couple of years? That kind of timeframe? ", "Jim Wells ", "", "It is just like I said about equity. If you can tell me what normal looks like I could answer that but probably. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group. ", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "I was curious to see your experience in terms of offloading your foreclosure mix because that was the most interesting part of the quarter to me. What is the foreclosure environment in for specifically? Anecdotal evidence would say it has been very slow and when you talk about testing the market in terms of moving things from foreclosure actually into the market or actually from nonaccrual into foreclosure what are those tests going to be like? Can you provide more color? ", "Tom Freeman ", "", "Let me make sure I understand the question so I am not answering something different from what you are asking. Are you interested in our experience and the timeframe and difficulty of foreclosures in Florida? Is that the first part of the question? ", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "Yes. ", "Tom Freeman ", "", "It has been very extended. Initially one would expect and we find in almost all jurisdictions we are able to resolve foreclosure issues within a 12 month timeframe. In Florida it is extended to almost 2 years on average and continues to extend as we do that. That being said, with stability in home prices beginning to show up all over Florida and in fact some increasing markets, the market out there looks to be for early stage foreclosures with some of the buyers out there in the marketplace which is an interesting comment I believe upon expectations for house prices within the Florida market. ", "Jim Wells ", "", "Just to add on, the action we took has to do with nonperforming loans that are in the process of foreclosure. ", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "", "I am not [sure] I understand they have been in the process for obviously an extended period of time right? ", "Tom Freeman ", "", "These were primarily early stage foreclosures that we sold. ", "Meredith Whitney \u2013 Meredith Whitney Advisory Group", "So what happens if more people go to market because anecdotally you heard this quarter more people in Florida are actually moving properties on the market and there is the supply jam that disrupts pricing. Did you then sort of halt that process or suspend that process to wait for a better time? How does that work? ", "Tom Freeman ", "", "One of the reasons we were anxious to do it this quarter is we saw some real stability between supply and demand in the marketplace at the current time. People looked at it and there was demand for purchase of a product. We will continue to be evaluating what is going on in the market. What we don\u2019t want to do is over a longer period of time is impair the value of these loans to our shareholders by simply dumping them out in the marketplace.

", "", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group ", "A quick question for Jim I guess. In your opening remarks you talked about the repayment of TARP at the appropriate time. Could you give us any sense of when the appropriate time is in your mind? ", "Jim Wells ", "I have talked about this for months and months and I will repeat what I have said if that is useful to you. I am not sure it should be but it is. The reality is we are very sensitive about the dilution that might be required, and I say might because I don\u2019t know, were we to repay TARP say now for example. What we are trying to do is to balance our devotion to our existing shareholders and the dilutive effect that might occur with potential increases in stock price or reduced requirements or whatever. What we are doing is we are running a balancing act here we think is benefiting everybody and certainly has so far. ", "Ed Najarian \u2013 ISI Group ", "", "So your sense would be you are waiting for your stock price to be higher, therefore your potential shares you would issue would be less diluted? ", "Jim Wells ", "", "What I said specifically was we are trying to balance our inherent disinclination to further dilute our shareholders with the need to and obviously our core capability of having liquidity and what not to repay TARP.

And though macro economic indicators are mixed, and there are uncertainty in our operating environment as it relates to financial regulation and the potential impact from the Gulf oil spill, we are increasingly encouraged by the operating trends that we're seeing. ", "Revenue grew compared to last quarter with growth across our core fee income category. We find this broad-based growth positive and believe that while the operating environment remains challenging, some economic traction coupled with our client-focused strategies generated these favorable results. We also had some non-core gains related to the sale of securities and fair value adjustments that Mark will detail shortly. ", "Net interest income and net interest margin were stable compared to last quarter but grew significantly compared to the prior year, up 8% and 39 basis points, respectively. The net interest margin increased due largely to the continued shifts in our funding mix to lower-cost deposits. Client deposit growth and improved mix enabled the reduction in higher-cost sources of funding and that, along with the lower rates pace, has had a significant impact on margin over the last year. Overall, we continue to make progress in our efforts to improve client satisfaction and our focus on the drivers that build loyalty. We're confident that this approach is having an impact.", "Our core expenses remain tightly managed as we continue to capitalize upon the strength that we've built. This will remain focused on recovering efficiency improvement opportunities. This was evident in our personnel-related expenses, which were down compared to last year. Cyclical costs do remain high, and we also incurred debt extinguishment costs during the quarter, and Mark will provide more detail around those items, which drove the overall expense number higher this quarter. ", "Asset quality trends continue to improve. Non-performing assets, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses all declined this quarter. Though early-stage delinquencies were up slightly, more than all of that increase was due to government guaranteed loan delinquencies. Excluding such loans, early-stage delinquencies were down six basis points. While Construction charge-offs increased as we expected, there was broad-based improvement in the remainder of the portfolio. ", "Consistent with our efforts to align our businesses and services for the long-term satisfaction of our targeted clients, last week, we announced the completion of our strategic review of RidgeWorth, we reached definitive agreement for Federated to acquire approximately $17 billion of managed liquidity assets. We expect to record a relatively small gain in the fourth quarter that includes an upfront payment plus the estimated present value of a five-year earn-out. We believe RidgeWorth's core fixed income and equity asset management businesses offer future attractive growth opportunities for SunTrust.", "In summary, we believe that modestly improving economic conditions are positively reflecting results and our efforts to position ourselves for growth beyond the cycle are evidencing themselves in our core performance. We are well positioned and with solid capital and liquidity, we operate from a position of strength. We're committed to investing in growth businesses, managing expenses prudently and returning the company to profitability. ", "And though lingering operating environment uncertainties certainly exist, we remain encouraged by improving results and prospects. Two particular items that we're all interested in and obviously, have been topical in recent months include the Gulf oil spill and financial regulation. I'll first address the oil spill on Slide 4. ", "While we realize that there is no way to predict the ultimate economic impact of the oil spill and the effect that it could have on asset quality, I wanted to provide some color on our exposure to areas currently being affected. Specifically, this slide shows our loan exposure on the Florida Panhandle region. We have a relatively small presence in this area with $1.3 billion in loans outstanding, and when you consider commercial loans to borrowers and industries that are particularly susceptible to the impact of the oil spill, the gray shaded parts of the chart, our outstanding balances are just $93 million. Though we have a small exposure, we are on top of it. We sent lenders and senior management into the affected markets to monitor the overall climate and the needs, and we continue to assess our risks and our responses. At this time, we have taken no broad actions but we are working individually with clients that have been affected.", "Our entire Gulf Coast exposure, which for us, constitutes the Gulf Coast of Florida and a small amount of Alabama, is understandably larger. However, it too is well diversified with less than $1 billion in commercial loans and those industries that would be particularly vulnerable: Real estate, consumer products and services and retailing. Recent forecast suggests that there is a very high likelihood that much of this region will not be impacted by the spill. ", "While we believe that our relative exposure in the area currently most impacted by the oil spill is minimal, we know that in no way diminishes the impact on our clients and teammates living and working there. It's clear that the ultimate impact of this environmental tragedy has yet to be determined and we are committed to helping the region and its residents recover.", "In that same vein, we're obviously closely monitoring changes to financial regulation. While some of the uncertainties surrounding regulatory reform has been resolved, it remains unclear what material effects the changes will have in terms of the economic recovery, in terms of consumer confidence and the global competitiveness of our industry. The real work of translating legislative policies into laws, regulations, rules, practices and procedures, that will directly affect our industry is just now beginning and will take time to complete. Some of our regulations once written, will have little to no impact on our results, the Volcker rule, for instance. Conversely, other items will have a quantifiable effect in the near term such as Regulation E and the new regulations regarding debit interchange fees. Mark Chancy will provide some additional commentary on these topics.", "I'd like to conclude here by saying that we have a process in place for evaluating these items, we will actively engage in development of these rules and regulations, and we will react accordingly as clarity is provided. ", "To conclude, I will reiterate that we are encouraged by recent operating trends. The strong foundation we have created, coupled with our client-focused execution, risk mitigation capabilities and a long-term economic prospects in our markets, position SunTrust well for the future. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark. Mark?", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5 of the earnings presentation with a summary income statement. ", "For the quarter, we posted a loss to common shareholders of $56 million or $0.11 per share. The net effect of securities gains, debt extinguishment cost and mark-to-market gains on our debt contributed a positive $0.07 per share to the quarter. And even after adjusting for these items, the earnings per share loss narrowed significantly from the prior quarter and prior year levels of $0.46 and $0.41 per share, respectively. Also, the company did generate positive earnings before preferred dividends this quarter. ", "As in prior quarters, the net earnings losses driven by the recessionary environment with elevated net charge-offs, high cyclical expenses and tepid loan demand. Despite these impacts, there were a number of positive trends that drove continued improvement in our financials. The recovering, albeit, uneven economy contributed to a portion of our improved results. This improvement was most notable in the $200 million decline in our provision expense from the first quarter, which was driven by continued favorable credit trends. ", "Additionally, we also saw the positive benefits from actions that we have been taking to drive better performance. This improvement was especially evident in higher sequential fee income across a broad range of categories. We also saw continued favorable shifts in our deposit mix, which together with our proactive asset liability management actions, drove stable net interest income and margin on a sequential basis, as well as 8% net interest income growth and 39 basis points of margin expansion versus the prior year.", "With that brief summary of our second quarter results, I'll now shift to Slide 6, which provides a summary balance sheet. Average loan balances, excluding non-accruals, were down 1% and 10% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. Overall demand remain muted but we did see a continued slowing in the pace of balance declines and slight growth in certain categories. ", "Overall, balance declines continue to be driven by our higher risk categories, most notably Construction, which was down 20% from the prior quarter and accounted for over 1/2 of our sequential decline in total loan balances. Increases in consumer loans essentially offset declines in the commercial loan category. Consumer direct and indirect loans grew 6% and 4%, respectively versus the prior quarter, with growth primarily driven by student and auto loans. ", "Commercial Loans were down 2%. The balance decline in this category was the smallest since the fourth quarter of 2008, which is the last time that we saw core growth in this portfolio. Now you will recall that we reported growth in this loan category last quarter but it was entirely driven by the impact of the implementation of FAS 167. ", "Line of credit utilization rates stabilized somewhat in the second quarter, down about 150 basis points for our larger corporate clients and flat for our midsized clients. We continue to remain hopeful that loan demand from credit-worthy borrowers will increase, and that loan growth will return in the second half of the year. While the slowing pace of loan decline provides some optimism that this could occur in 2010, we continue to remain uncertain of the exact magnitude and timing of a pick up in demand.", "Now moving onto deposits at the bottom of the slide. You can see that core deposits increased, and that the positive shift in mix continued. Balance increases were driven by lower-cost deposits, specifically DDA [demand deposit account] and money market, which both grew 4% sequentially or about $2.4 billion combined. Other CD balances declined $1 billion in the quarter as we continue to allow run-off in this portfolio, particularly single-service CDs. ", "We also further reduced our brokered and foreign deposits, which were down approximately $760 million this quarter and 60% year-over-year. Overall, we have significantly enhanced our liquidity position during this past year, primarily via the growth of lower-cost deposits. This increase in deposits has enabled us to take a series of actions to reduce our higher-cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our cost of funds.", "Not depicted on this slide, but one such additional action in this regard that occurred toward the end of the quarter was the early termination of $900 million in debt. This debt carried a coupon of approximately 5% and had about two years to maturity, and the cost associated with this termination of $63 million is included in the quarter's expenses. We also took actions with our securities portfolio, so let's turn to Slide 7.", "Our total available for sale portfolio stood at $27.6 billion at the end of the quarter. In an effort to manage our interest rate risk profile, as well as to reposition the portfolio in areas where we saw relative value, we executed a series of transactions during the quarter. ", "Most notably, we extended our U.S. Treasury position and grew the MBS portfolio via purchasing $2.5 billion of mortgage-backed agency securities. The MBS purchase was funded via $1 billion sale of bullet U.S. agencies, as well as from our deposit growth. The collective actions taken during the quarter yielded $57 million in securities gains. ", "The portfolio continues to be concentrated in high quality and very liquid securities. Government and agency securities, which are the first four rows on the slide, constitute the vast majority of balances, and the other equity securities are largely Coca-Cola, Federal Reserve and FHLB stock. ", "Going forward, we continue to have the flexibility to respond to changes in the environment and to take actions that best balance our excess liquidity position against current investment returns. I'll now take a moment to cover the margin on Slide 8.", "Lower funding costs more than offset slightly lower asset yields in the quarter, contributing to a one basis point sequential improvement in net interest margin to 3.33%. Margin exceeded our prior expectations and guidance due primarily to better-than-expected deposit pricing and mix, and the effects of the aforementioned securities portfolio transactions. ", "Relative to the prior year, margin is up 39 basis points. This improvement is driven primarily by the lower funding costs discussed earlier. In 2009 and early 2010, we also extended the duration of our Commercial Loan portfolio through a series of interest rate swaps, which have contributed a meaningful amount of net interest income in 2010, given the very low rate environment that has persisted throughout the year. ", "Finally, we have improved our loan pricing discipline across the company, and this effort is evident in our loan yields. You will note that we have modified our expectations somewhat regarding the margin for the remainder of the year, as we now expect it to be within a range of 3.25% to 3.35%. This modification reflects the fact that the benefits that we are currently experiencing related to deposit pricing, the favorable deposit mix, our interest rate swap position and the early debt termination are likely to continue for the next couple of quarters. As a final comment on this slide, I will note that we remained modestly asset sensitive at the end of the quarter.", "Let's now move to provision on Slide 9. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter were $662 million, down $200 million from the first quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Provision was $60 million less than charge-offs with $40 million of this differential coming from a reduction in the unfunded commitments reserve due to improved equity related to certain commercial and large corporate clients. ", "Charge-offs were $722 million, a decrease of almost $100 million from the first quarter. Now you may recall that a move of certain non-performing loans to held for sale and a charge-off policy change increased first quarter charge-offs by a combined $182 million. When normalizing for these items, charge-offs in the second quarter were up $83 million sequentially, which was consistent with our expectations and driven as anticipated primarily by construction loans. Despite the notable improvement in asset quality in the quarter, the allowance ratio was held stable at 2.81%, due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the direction of the economy and home values at this time. Now moving to non-interest income on Slide 10.", "On a reported basis, non-interest income was up 36% sequentially and down 11% from the prior year. After adjusting for a number of items in each quarter, non-interest income increased by 12% and declined by 10%, respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains, and as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today's presentation. ", "In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are the aforementioned $57 million in securities gains, as well as a $63 million gain associated with our fair value debt and related hedges. The primary drivers of the adjusted year-over-year decline are mortgage related. Production volumes declined roughly 60% from the prior year as refinancing activity waned. Mortgage repurchase losses were higher in the current quarter and the prior year quarter included a large MSR [Mortgage Servicing Rights] recovery. ", "Focusing on the sequential quarter comparison, we posted increases across all major categories. Specifically, mortgage-related income was up $31 million due to the MSR hedge performance and higher production volumes, which more than offset a $20 million increase in repurchase losses. ", "We also saw increases in key consumer and commercial fee-based categories. The company has been placing significant focus on servicing and growing our client base, and we believe the increases in these categories, which include mid to high single-digit sequential growth in service charges, card fees, trust income and retail investment services, are all evidence of our success. And importantly, much of this growth was from underlying drivers like an increase in the number of accounts, expanded client relationships and an increase in product usage.", "I'll shift gears for a minute to provide you some additional color on the potential impact to SunTrust of regulatory reform. As you all know, and Jim mentioned in his opening remarks, the situation is fluid, and we are in the process of thoroughly evaluating the possible implications and the mitigating actions. To assist you in your own estimation process, we wanted to provide a little more color on three of our fee income streams that are amongst the most obvious items that could be impacted by the reform. ", "First, I'll focus on deposit service charges. Last quarter, we indicated that we expected that Reg E could cause a 10% to 20% reduction in service charges. To date, the number of clients opting in, those that would be electing to continue their participation in overdraft coverage, has been well above our expectations. As such, we currently believe that the annualized impact to overdraft income will fall toward the lower end of our original range. ", "Second, I'll turn to interchange. Consumer and small business debit card interchange contributed about $250 million in fee income during 2009. Now for clarity, that is our full year interchange revenue, not the impact that we expect Dodd-Frank to have on this fee income category, and we continue to develop our expectations around that matter. ", "Third, I'll provide some color on derivatives. Derivatives contributed about $100 million in revenue in 2009, most of which was generated from end users. We do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes on derivatives will have a material impact on this revenue category for SunTrust. ", "Finally, it's also obvious that regulatory costs will increase significantly, although the amount is difficult to quantify at this time. So let's now turn to Slide 11 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends.", "This quarter, we increased the reserve for mortgage repurchases by $46 million. Mortgage repurchase costs, which are recorded as a reduction to mortgage production income, increased from $128 million in the first quarter to $148 million this quarter, while charge-offs declined by $16 million to $102 million. And despite this decline in charge-offs, we increased the reserve because new repurchase request volume was up during the quarter, though the request varied significantly by month. For example, April and May were relatively low months, while June was specially high. And while we have seen a significant decline in request volume month-to-date in July, it is too early in the third quarter to suggest that this reflects anything other than normal monthly volatility. ", "The key points from the bottom part of this slide remain the same as we have discussed last quarter. Most of our current request volume is currently coming from the higher loss of vintages of 2007 and prior. We expect that normal seasoning patterns for origination of vintages over time will shift new request volume to newer vintages. As that occurs, we expect both lower loss frequencies and severities, as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics such as higher FICOs and lower original LTVs, and they were originated during or after the periods they experienced the most significant home price depreciation. ", "In conclusion and consistent with what we told you last quarter, near-term losses and reserve levels will largely be driven by the volume of new repurchase requests, which are difficult to predict. If new request volume begins to taper off during the second half of the year, we expect charge-offs and reserves to likewise decline. However, if new request volumes increase or the expected shift towards newer vintages does not occur, then charge-offs and reserves could remain at current levels or higher. I'll now turn to Slide 12 for a review of expenses.", "Non-interest expense declined 2% when compared to the second quarter of 2009 and increased 10% compared to last quarter. However, there were certain unusual items that warrant discussion and on this slide, we have adjusted for items that are detailed in the appendix of today's presentation. ", "On an adjusted basis, expenses are up 3% versus the prior year and 6% sequentially. You will note at the bottom of the slide, the three primary drivers of the increases, which include credit-related costs, marketing and outside processing. These three categories explain almost the entirety of the year-over-year expense and all the $25 million of the sequential quarter increase. ", "For both the year-over-year and sequential quarter comparisons, the drivers of growth in these particular categories are similar. Credit-related costs increased as a result of other real estate expenses. Marketing expenses were from planned promotional and advertising spending supporting our brand, and outside processing was largely due to investments aimed in enhancing our clients' banking experience and from higher volumes. ", "I'll also provide you a little color on our personnel-related expenses as they evidence our continued focus on expense management. Employee compensation and benefits declined $21 million or 3% from the prior year and $9 million or 1% from the prior quarter. The reduction from the first quarter was driven largely by the approximate $25 million seasonal decline in FICA [Federal Insurance Contributions Act] and 401(k)expenses, partially offset by modest merit increases that took effect this quarter and higher incentive compensation associated with higher revenues. Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a brief discussion of capital.", "Capital ratios remain solid this quarter and increased from first quarter levels. As a few selected highlights, Tier 1 Capital increased by an estimated 27 basis points from the first quarter to 13.4%. Tier 1 Common improved by an estimated 15 basis points to 7.85%, and tangible common equity increased 30 basis points to 7.18%, driven primarily by unrealized securities gains increasing other comprehensive income, which was also the cause for the expansion in our book and tangible book values per share. Given the continued strength in our capital position, our view that we are well positioned to repay TARP at the appropriate time remains unchanged. Before concluding, I'll briefly summarize some of the key points I've discussed today.", "We significantly narrowed our earnings loss this quarter and we're profitable before prepayment of preferred dividends. Provision declined due to improved asset quality without any reduction in the allowance as a percentage of loans. Favorable deposit trends continued. Net interest margin remained stable from the prior quarter and was up substantially from the prior year, primarily due to lower funding costs. Non-interest income grew sequentially across a broad range of categories, evidencing success in our client-centric initiatives. And non-interest expenses continue to be closely managed. We are encouraged by the trends in our performance, and despite continued uncertainty in the environment, we remain focused on continuing to drive improvements in our results. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality. Tom?", "Thomas Freeman", "Thanks, Mark. Today, I'm going to review our asset quality beginning on Slide 14. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing assets all decreased significantly. Delinquencies and loan balances were stable to down, particularly in certain higher risk portfolio. Despite improved asset quality metrics in the current quarter, the Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses, as a percent of loans had been maintained at the prior quarter level in light of continued uncertainty regarding the strength of the economic recovery and trends in home values.", "Aggregate loan balances continued to decline in the face of lower loan demand and line usage, as well as targeted actions taken regarding higher risk portfolios such as Construction. This modest decline matched the amount of new loan originations in the portfolio, particularly in commercial lending. Through the first six months of 2010, we have originated $6.9 billion in new C&I loan commitments and leases, which is a 32% increase over the first six months of 2009. ", "Early-stage delinquencies represent 1.26% of the portfolio, up from 1.19% in the first quarter. This increase was driven by higher delinquencies in Federally-guaranteed student loans. After removing portfolios with Federal government guarantees for both quarters, the ratio improved to 98 basis points from 104 basis points last quarter, a six basis points improvement. We believe that the pace of improvement in delinquencies in some portfolios may slow as they approach historic numbers.", "Other portfolios, such as Consumer and Commercial Real Estate are more closely aligned with the general economy and employment trends. We expect delinquencies in these portfolios to remain at elevated levels until conditions improve. ", "Non-performing loans declined during the quarter by over $485 million, which represented the fourth consecutive quarterly decline. Non-performing assets declined by $580 million. Inflows into non-performing are trending down, which when coupled with our aggressive problem asset resolution efforts resulted in lower balances. ", "Charge-offs of $722 million during the second quarter were in line with our expectations. The net charge-off ratio declined from 2.91% to 2.57%, with all portfolio showing improvement, except Commercial Real Estate and Construction. Charge-off activity continues to be centered in residential real estate-related portfolios, including residential mortgages, land and residential construction.", "Please turn to Slide 15 for a review of the loan portfolio. This portfolio view of asset quality illustrates generally improving credit quality. Charge-offs declined broadly among the portfolios. Early-stage delinquencies were stable to down, and balances in some of the highest risk portfolios continued to decline. The longer-term reduction in balances in higher risk portfolio is positive. For example, over the past 12 months, construction balances, including land, have gone nearly 40%. Alt-A balances have declined nearly 18% and higher risk home equity lines have declined 12%.", "Commercial portfolios continues to perform satisfactorily overall. Commercial early-stage delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs were down quarter-over-quarter. Our view remains that overall C&I asset quality should improve. ", "While the Commercial Real Estate portfolio, consisting of owner-occupied and investor-owned properties continues to perform reasonably well. Charge-offs, early-stage delinquencies and non-performing loans increased slightly from very low basis. In fact, the increase in charge-off ratio represents only a $10 million increase in charge-offs, while the increase in NPLs was only $51 million. Given the conditions in the Commercial Real Estate market, we expect additional stress in credit losses in this portfolio. However, we also continue to believe our portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition and the way it was underwritten.", "Asset quality improved in the consumer portfolios, with lower early-stage delinquencies when Federally-guaranteed loans are excluded and charge-off ratios that were stable to down. I'm going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and Construction portfolios in detail in a moment. So for now, I will summarize. ", "Overall, Home Equity performance has been stable as balances and charge-offs declined, while early-stage delinquencies and non-performing loans were flat. Residential Mortgage charge-offs and delinquencies declined, while balances increased modestly. As noted last quarter, we expect the Construction charge-offs to increase, and in fact, was to level similar to what we experienced in the second half of 2009. We continue to expect the elevated charge-offs in this portfolio as problem loans move through the workout process. Next, I'm going to discuss our real estate secured portfolios in more detail, beginning with the Residential Mortgage portfolio on Slide 16.", "Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of non-performing loans and delinquencies, driven in large part by the core portfolio. Growth in the core mortgage portfolio was predominantly tied to the originations of mortgages that have Federal government guarantees. Dollar delinquencies and non-performing loans in this portfolio improved by $15 million and $303 million, respectively. Non-performing balances declined in every segment of the portfolio. ", "Delinquency trends in this portfolio imply a lower frequency of future loss and home price deterioration appears to be slowing in many of our markets. While our outlook for this portfolio is generally stable to improving, the pace of the economic recovery, covered with elevated unemployment rates and variability in housing prices could continue to negatively impact credit quality and the level and frequency of charge-offs.", "I will now move to Slide 17 to discuss Home Equity loans. Home Equity portfolio balances and charge-offs continue to decline, while non-accruals were relatively low and stable. Elevated credit metrics are largely driven by the higher risk segments of the portfolio, such as loans, which were originated by third parties, loans in Florida and loans with higher loan-to-value ratios. Balances in these segments continue to decline but no new production and little line availability. Now if you will turn to Slide 18, I'll talk about our Construction portfolio.", "We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to higher risk construction loans. Construction balances continued to decline rapidly, dropping 13% over the quarter. To put this in context, Construction balances in 2007 exceeded $14 billion and are now down by nearly $9 billion or 64%. The Construction Perm portfolio and non-accrual loan balances continue to wind down, as new production remains slow. Issues in this portfolio have been identified and work-out efforts related to older product continue. Construction non-performing loans decreased by 14% quarter-over-quarter, and we believe that residential non-performing loans will be stable to down in the future.", "Construction delinquencies declined overall. The Residential Construction segment will remain problematic, with most of the portfolio being actively worked out. We expect delinquencies and losses related to Residential Construction to remain elevated, as we continue to resolve problem loans. While the timing of charge-offs is difficult to predict, we believe that this portfolio is appropriately reserved, and the problems have been aggressively addressed. ", "Credit performance in the Commercial Construction portfolio remains acceptable overall. Balances declined significantly, while charge-off ratios and non-performers increased only modestly. Please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our loan modification efforts and resulting troubled debt restructurings or TDRs.", "TDRs increased by $360 million in the current quarter as compared to roughly $300 million last quarter and $500 million in each of the prior two quarters. Growth in consumer residential restructured loans, was about $260 million in the second quarter and was similar to the volume in the first quarter. Residential TDRs began slowing in the first quarter due to fewer newly delinquent loans and fewer modifications of more seriously delinquent loans. There's been an increase in commercial TDRs, primarily within non-accrual, income property loans. ", "Commercial-related TDRs account for 8% of total TDRs and only 2% of accruing TDRs. We expect moderate growth in Commercial Real Estate TDRs over the near term. Accruing TDR balances totaled $2.3 billion at June 30. Accruing TDRs comprised 70% of total TDRs and 87% are current for interest and principal payments. Approximately 73% of accruing and non-accruing TDRs are current. Non-accruing TDRs have the potential to move to accrual status, if payment performance is sustained for a defined period of time. ", "Overall, performance of the accruing TDRs continues to exceed our expectations during the second quarter. With 94% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio is much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than it is to a restructured portfolio. I'll summarize the key points from today's credit update before turning the call back over to Steve. Please turn to Slide 20. ", "Overall, asset quality continue to improve in the quarter. Delinquencies were stable to down in most of the portfolios. Compared to the first quarter, non-performing loans and assets and charge-offs declined significantly. Significant progress has been made in reducing balances in higher risk portfolios over the past 12 to 18 months. We believe that the pace of improvement in delinquencies will slow, as delinquencies in certain portfolios approach historic norms. Other portfolios that are more closely aligned with the general economy and employment trends will remain elevated until conditions improve. Consumer and mortgage asset quality metrics generally improved. Construction charge-offs increased significantly and balances declined as we continue to aggressively work through the risk in this portfolio. ", "The level of Residential Mortgage modifications were stable during the second quarter. There was an increase in commercial restructures, particularly in Commercial Real Estate. We expect modest increases in Commercial Real Estate TDRs for the near term. The proportion of TDRs that are current interest in principal and interest and payments improved from last quarter to 73%. Approximately 87% of all accruing TDRs are current on interest and principal payments.", "At the current time, we expect overall charge-offs to be stable to down from the third quarter. Factors which could affect general asset quality and charge-offs levels include macro or regional economic volatility and trends within specific sectors, such as Commercial Real Estate. ", "Finally, assuming no further material deterioration in the economy or asset quality metrics, the Allowance for Loans and Lease Losses likely peak from the first quarter. However, we maintain reserve levels for the time being, in light of continued economic and real estate value uncertainty. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.", "Steven Shriner", "Thank you, Tom. Before we take questions, I'd just like to remind you to limit your questions to one with one follow-up. And with that, operator, we're ready to take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Brian Foran with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I appreciate the disclosure on the Panhandle, and I think one of the things people might have missed is you guys aren't that big there. As we think through the rest of Florida, as we move down the West Coast, it starts to become a much bigger exposure for you. How are you thinking about risk of some of the oil impact spreading, and maybe any color you're seeing realtime in places like Tampa and Sarasota moving down the coast or prices weakening or transactions weakening or things looking up?", "James Wells", "Brian, this is Jim. The most recent official forecast that I've seen was put out by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. I'm glad I got all that out, NOAA. And it basically said that the west coast of Florida as opposed to the Panhandle, had a 1% to 20% chance of some issues with the oil spill. And that in the last -- this is two- or three-week old data, so it's before the stopping of the leakage. Declining from 20, if it were 20, it tends to be going down. They have a belief that there are some issues that the loop current in the Gulf will feed into the Gulfstream and that there maybe some issues in South Florida. But as it goes on and as the Gulfstream separates from the North American continent, they predict much less, the farther the north you go. And our experience basically so far is not bad. Of course, the devastation right on the shoreline and some parts of our footprint, are less actually than if further west on the Gulf coast. So we are obviously concerned about it. Floridians are concerned about it. We haven't seen a meaningful economic impact on the west coast of the peninsula but obviously, the tourism issue and valuations and loss of tenant rental income and all those kinds of things in the Panhandle, particularly the western part of the Florida Panhandle are worst, if that's a useful update.", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "One follow-up on the mortgage repurchase trends. Are there any leading indicators, First Horizon mentioned, mortgage insurer rescission request because there was a lag between that going to the GSEs [government-sponsored enterprises] and ultimately back to the banks. Different banks have pointed to different things, but are there any leading indicators you found useful that investors can watch to try to get a sense of what the next couple of quarters might progress like?", "William Rogers", "This is Bill Rogers. Let me take a shot at that. It's hard to sort of look at, as Mark pointed out, leading indicators because of so much volatility, from literally month-to-month. I think for us, primarily looking at the improvement in the portfolio that's going to be subject to a rescission is probably the best litmus test for us. As it relates to the MI [mortgage insurer] rescinds, I think probably the question you really are asking and maybe should be asking is, are those accounted for in our reserve? And what we do is exactly that. I mean, we look at MI rescinds that have not yet resulted in a repurchase request, for example, and make sure that they're incorporated into the reserve by some calculation or estimation. Is that helpful?", "Brian Foran - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That is.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "Number one, on the loan-loss reserve. Jim, do you have any indications whether the regulators are going to be putting forth some guidance? I mean, we know we're going to get capital guidance probably in November, but is there going to be any guidance on reserve and/or reserve policy going forward?", "James Wells", "I would hope so. But, Nancy, we're all well aware, I know you are of the issue between the SEC and the bank regulators in terms of reserve desirability levels and all that sort of thing. And while I'm sure, I don't know this, but I'm sure and confident that there are conversations going on. We received no particular indication about any of that. So I think at this point, it's a toss-up.", "Nancy Bush - NAB Research", "I noticed you had a step-up in marketing expenses during the quarter  to kind of a new level. And I noticed the, and I'm sure you did as well, the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago, about concentration in some of your markets. I think Orlando was the market that they had explored and it was somewhat startling, the degree to which three large banks are controlling that market now. How are you responding to this concentration issue in your markets. Is this step-up in marketing a result of that?", "James Wells", "The interesting thing is that the word used in the article such as dominate, why you might have a relatively large concentration on the top three in any particular market, it's by far from being dominated. The reality is all of that markets are loaded with regional and smaller institutions that compete pretty aggressively, so that's a qualitative comment. Now, basically what we're doing is we're promoting our brand and we're promoting our operating model, and we're working hard on the delivery of service quality, such as that to our clients. And this advertising uptick started actually about two and half years ago. If you go back and look at the numbers, we are much more inclined to do that. It's been very well accepted. The brand positioning has been very well accepted. And to get to Orlando specifically, we're still number one share there. And Nancy, I think in our 20 or 25 metropolitan statistical areas, the top three banks have similar, maybe less than Orlando, as a number but similar. It's always the same banks and it always has been and there's actually nothing new about that.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Greg Ketron with Citigroup.", "Gregory Ketron - Citigroup Inc", "I have a question, kind of longer term as we move our way out through the rest of this year and into next year. You're hearing other banks talk about prices on real estate firming up, and as you look at your NPA strategy going forward, how much do you see that play out? I mean, would you be delivering properties into the marketplace that maybe on accelerated pace, and we might see things like ROE expense stay elevated for a number of quarters? Or just really any thoughts around that as we move forward?", "Thomas Freeman", "Greg, it's Tom. We've built a very efficient and substantial disposition machine in our OREO departments. They move through the properties we take on with some alacrity. Last quarter, you saw us go and do a disposition of some loans because we thought the market was really advantageous to a disposition activity. As the markets continue to firm and the secondary market for sale of assets or sale of loans were to be advantageous, we have the resources and capabilities to be able to do those sorts of a transaction, should we decide to. I think we will continue to work through this on a careful and thoughtful basis, very mindful of our shareholders and preserving those resources as we move it through. But if you look at the velocity of disposition over the past couple of years, we've done a pretty good job of when we get a hold of the properties, getting rid of them.", "Gregory Ketron - Citigroup Inc", "And would you expect ROE expense to maybe stay elevated for a number of quarters, or is it too difficult to predict?", "Thomas Freeman", "No, I think we have a fairly good prediction on that stuff and really know what we've got much coming in, and I think that's exactly right. You're going to have elevated ORE (sic) [ROE] expenses over the next few quarters until we're through with the disposition portion of the cycle.", "James Wells", "Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's call.

(NYSE:STI) Q3 2010 Earnings Call October 21, 2010  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Steve Shriner \u2013 Director, Investor Relations", "Jim Wells \u2013 Chief Executive Officer", "Mark Chancy \u2013 Chief Financial Officer]", "Tom Freeman \u2013 Chief Risk Officer", "Analysts", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Tom Sherlock \u2013 CLSA", "David Hilder \u2013 Susquehanna", "Bob Patten \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Operator", "Welcome to the SunTrust Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Parties will be on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. (Operator Instructions)", "This call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect. I\u2019d like to introduce your speaker, Mr. Steve Shriner and he is the Director of Investor Relations.", "Steve Shriner", "Good morning. Welcome to SunTrust\u2019s third quarter earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. Slide two outlines the content, which includes an overview of the quarter, financial results and a review of credit quality. The press release presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "With me today are members of our management team Jim Wells, Chief Executive Officer; Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter. Mark will then discuss financial performance and Tom will conclude with review of asset quality. At the conclusion of the formal remarks, we\u2019ll open the session for questions.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings which are available on the website. Further, we do not intend to update any further forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the statements are made and we disclaim any responsibility to do so.", "During the call we\u2019ll discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release on our website.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and -- websites are located on our website.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim.", "Jim Wells", "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everybody. Glad you\u2019re with us this morning. Financial results improved significantly this quarter as we earned $84 million or $0.17 per share. Strong revenue coupled with lower credit costs grew significantly increased profitability.", "As you\u2019re all aware throughout this economic cycle we have been positioning our businesses for growth. Those efforts are gaining traction and resulting in improved performance. Until macroeconomic indicators are mixed and there remains uncertainty in regard to regulation we are increasingly encouraged by the improvement in our operating results.", "Revenue growth in the quarter was particularly strong in mortgage related revenues as we benefited from the lower interest rate. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey also had a terrific quarter posting report investment banking revenues. Partially offsetting the performance of these core businesses, excuse me, was a decrease in service charges, largely related to Reg E and $81 million of mark-to-market losses on debt and indexed linked CDs.", "Net interest income and net interest margin increased compared to last quarter, up 5% and 8 basis points, respectively. Net interest margin increased largely due to the improved funding mix and lower rate paid on deposits.", "Additionally, the securities and loan portfolios increased, while earning asset yields remained stable. Total expenses were flat compared to last quarter while core expenses increased mostly driven by revenue related compensation and legal related expenses. Mark will provide more detail on this momentarily, however, I will reiterate that we continue to manage expenses tightly across the organization while making what we believe are appropriate investments in our business to facilitate growth.", "Asset quality trends continue to improve with non-performing asset, non-accrual loans, net charge-offs and provision for loan losses all declining this quarter. As anticipated, early stage delinquencies were stable overall.", "We made a significant stride toward our goal to improve the client experience and thereby increase client satisfaction and loyalty. These efforts are beginning to manifest themselves in revenue growth. There\u2019s still a challenging operating environment, we are moving the needle in several key areas of the business.", "At the same time, we\u2019re aware of lingering operating environmental uncertainties such as regulatory and legislative matters. We\u2019ll move to slide four where we\u2019ve provided some information to add some clarity on that topic.", "It is clear that the financial regulation will impact our financial results, but we believe that for us it will be manageable. The information on slide four highlights selected items of interest though it is not intended to be all inclusive. Certain changes are expected to have little impact on SunTrust such as the Card Act while others such as the impact of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are simply not predictable at this time.", "First, I\u2019ll focus on deposit service charges. Last quarter we indicated that the impact of Reg E on service charges was expected to be at the low end of the previously provided 10% to 20% range. That expectation remains. However, additional clarity is probably necessary.", "Clients continue to opt in and we expect them to do so over the next two to three quarters. Therefore, we expect to see a more substantial negative impact on service charges now but as clients continue to opt in the impact will trend down. We expect the impact from Reg E to stabilize to a low double-digit figure as we approach mid 2011. In the meantime it will probably be a little more elevated.", "We also chose to make changes outside of Reg E that were designed to improve client satisfaction. We decided to stop charging overdraft fees on individual transactions with a value of less than $5 and to reduce the number of maximum daily overdraft fees.", "These changes were effective July 1st and are expected to reduce service charges by an additional 5% to 6% annually. I\u2019ll also point out that these estimates do not include any mitigating effects of household retention, household growth or any changes to products or pricing.", "Derivatives contributed about $100 million in revenue in 2009, most of which was generated from clients. This is an area where we do not currently believe that the legislative and regulatory changes will have a material impact on the revenue for SunTrust.", "Consumer and small business debit card interchange contributed about $250 million in fee income during 2009. We expect some impact to this revenue stream, obviously. However, the ultimate amount will remain unknown until final regulations are written. This is a higher growth opportunity area and is driven by household growth, higher product penetration and increasing consumer usage pattern, which will help to offset the potential impact of lower interchange rates.", "We had anticipated an increase in FDIC deposit insurance costs as a result of the change in assessment base from deposits to assets. However, based on the FDIC\u2019s recent announcement, it appears that the impact will be less than originally anticipated though the amount is still not known at this time.", "The final item of note is the Collins Amendment and the effect it will have on Tier 1 capital. With $2.3 billion in outstanding instruments we expect a cumulative reduction in the Tier 1 ratio approximately 175 basis points. This is on an incremental basis and obviously will not include all the other factors that affect capital overtime. This reduction will occur over three years beginning in 2013 and with our solid capital position this is another completely manageable outcome.", "The time being, we view these instruments as reasonably attractive capital though we\u2019ll continue to valuate whether to call these securities by weighing their costs against the capital benefits.", "Now, turning to slide five an review of our capital position, virtually all of our key capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have each quarter depicted on the slide. During the third quarter Tier 1 capital increased to an estimated 13.6%, while estimated Tier 1 common increased to 8%. The total capital ratio declined in the current quarter as a result of the tender for subordinated debt that we completed in the third quarter.", "I\u2019d like to take a moment before I turn the call over to Mark to give some context to our estimated 8% Tier 1 common ratio in light of the recently announced Basel III requirements, so if you turn to slide six, the Tier 1 common capital ratio of 8%, which I mentioned, represents $10.7 billion of capital. That ratio is well above the announced Basel III regulatory standard.", "SunTrust estimated Tier 1 ratio of 8% is a full 1% of $1.3 billion above the threshold of 4.5% plus the 2.5% conservation buffer, which is not scheduled to become effective fully until 2019.", "SunTrust\u2019s capital position today is particularly strong, especially when you consider our proven credit risk profile. We reduced our higher risk portfolios by 10% to 15% since the end of 2008 and further more we have relatively low market and operating risk and high liquidity.", "And with strong capital, more clarity on capital standards, lower risk, high liquidity and improved earnings, we believe that we are well positioned to repay TARP. As I said, we will repay at the appropriate time and in a fashion that makes the most sense from both our shareholder and regulatory perspectives.", "The efforts being made to position SunTrust for growth beyond the cycle are translating into improved core performance. We are investing to grow the business. We are managing expenses prudently and we returned the company to profitability. And though modestly improving economic conditions are helping performance, we remain encouraged by our emerging operating results, there are certainly still quite a lot of work to be done, but we\u2019re making strides in the right direction.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark to provide more detail.", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks, Jim and good morning everybody. I\u2019ll begin my comments today on slide seven of the earnings presentation with a review of the summary income statement. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $84 million or $0.17 per share. This is $140 million improvement from the loss to common shareholders of $56 million that we posted in the second quarter. The improvement was largely attributable to strong core revenue performance, which increased $153 million sequentially.", "Net interest income increased 5%, non-interest income increased 10%, with a combined result of 7% increase in revenues. Now the key revenue drivers included increased earning assets, expanded net interest margin, significant increases in mortgage production and servicing revenue and a very strong quarter for investment banking.", "Further, a $47 million decline in provision for credit losses and flat non-interest expenses supported the sequential improvement in earnings. Provision for taxes increased $63 million to a small tax liability of $14 million with no material discrete items impacting tax provision in the quarter.", "The net effect of securities gains, debt extinguishment costs and mark-to-market gains and losses contributed $47 million to pre-tax income and we\u2019ve adjusted for these items when presenting SunTrust\u2019s core non-interest income for the quarter.", "In addition, third quarter results included $59 million in mark-to-market losses and an increase in legal related cost that we\u2019ve not adjusted for. I\u2019ll talk more about these puts and takes in just a minute. However, the overall takeaway was that this was a solid quarter of earnings for SunTrust.", "Now, with that said, I\u2019ll also acknowledge that the sustainable earnings of the company are still not where we want them to be. While we are very pleased with the revenue performance of our investment in mortgage banking businesses, we recognize that these revenue sources are subject to seasonal and cyclical variability.", "However, there are areas that we believe will drive sustained improvement in our financial results, while the economy remains weak, we expect that gradual continued improvement in economic conditions will result in lower charge-offs and reserves, reduced credit related expenses and increased client demand for loans and financial services in general.", "In terms of things that we have greater control over, we are encouraged by our continued success in improving client satisfaction and loyalty. Deposit growth, mix and rates paid and our investment banking performance are tangible examples where we believe this success is driving revenue. Additionally, we remain vigilant in managing expense growth to a proper balance between current income and investments for future profits.", "Now, with that brief summary of our third quarter results, I\u2019ll now shift to slide eight a review of loans and deposits. Average loan balances again excluding non-accruals were flat and down 6% as compared to last quarter and last year, respectively. The story here hasn\u2019t changed much since last quarter.", "Consumer loan categories continued to increase with commercial loan categories flat to down. However, there are some things I\u2019d like to call to your attention starting with the commercial loan category. Average commercial loan balances stabilized, breaking a declining trend that started in early 2009, excluding the impact that we had from the FAS 167 consolidation in the first quarter of 2010.", "Revolving line of credit utilization rates were stable during the quarter overall. Large corporate utilization was basically stable, while middle market and smaller client utilization declined marginally.", "Average balances stabilized and period end balances increased due to higher term loan balances and growth in the balances of three pillars, which you\u2019ll remember is our asset back commercial paper conduit.", "Average construction loan balances increased roughly one-half of 1%, which is an anomaly relative to recent trends. However, if you refer to the period end balance sheet in the press release tables, you\u2019ll see that construction loans actually declined $565 million or 11%, as compared to June 30th.", "Residential one to four family mortgages increased in the quarter, driven exclusively by increased holdings of federally guaranteed loans. With weak overall loan demand and high liquidity, we have chosen to retain some agency eligible mortgage loan production on balance sheet.", "Specifically, we increased our holdings of guaranteed mortgage loans by roughly $1.2 billion during the quarter and these loans are guaranteed by Fannie Mae under its long-term standby commitment program. While we have been growing consumer loans fairly consistently over the past year, growth in the current quarter was robust.", "In the current quarter organic growth remained and was augmented significantly by two actions. While it did not impact the average balance significantly, period end consumer direct growth concludes the consolidation of a previously off-balance sheet student loan securitization of just under $500 million.", "Growth in the consumer indirect category also includes the purchase of approximately $740 million in high quality consumer auto loans. We continue to expect that broad-based commercial loan growth will return with an improving economy. However, the evidence to date suggests that improvement will occur gradually. As this occurs, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow commercial loans and client segments and products that offer opportunity and to originate and acquire high-quality consumer loans.", "Now, moving on to deposits at the bottom of the slide, you can see that core deposits increased and the positive shift in mix to lower cost deposits continued. Balance increases were driven by DDA and money market accounts which sequentially increased four and 6% respectively. These categories combined provided over $3 billion in deposit growth.", "Now, partially offsetting this growth were now and CD balances which declined roughly $2.4 billion in the quarter. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the enhanced liquidity and lower cost funding that deposit growth has provided during this past year. This increase in deposits has enabled us to take a series of actions to reduce our higher cost funding sources, helping to drive significant reductions in our cost of funds and improvement in our net interest margin.", "Actions in the quarter taken to reduce higher cost funding sources include the repayment of bank sub-debt via a tender offer and additional home loan bank repayments, the combination of which was approximately $1 billion. We also continued during the quarter to reposition the securities portfolio. So let\u2019s turn to slide nine.", "Our total available for sale portfolio stood at $30.3 billion at the end of the quarter, up $2.7 billion from the end of the second quarter. At the beginning of the quarter, we developed a view that rates would decline due to the weakening economic indicators, that coupled with high liquidity caused us to take the opportunity to increase our holdings of high quality, liquid treasury and agency securities early in the third quarter.", "More specifically, we rebalanced the agency portion of our portfolio slightly lengthening the duration and netting securities gains of $69 million. With the decline in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain on the portfolio increased to approximately $830 million from $680 million at the end of the second quarter.", "We continue to regularly review this portfolio and so far in October, we\u2019ve sold $1.5 billion in securities, primarily to reduce our exposure to certain tranches of mortgage-backed securities that had increased in value during the quarter. As we look forward, over a longer time frame, we continue to expect that a growing economy will result in loan balances trending up and deposits trending down. With a basically stable cash position, we expect to decrease the securities portfolio in response to increasing loans and/or decreasing deposits.", "Now, I\u2019ll take a moment to cover the margin on slide 10. As I mentioned, lower cost funding drove an eight-basis point improvement in the margin to 3.41%, as earning asset yields were basically stable. Margin exceeded our prior expectations and guidance due primarily to better than expected deposit pricing and mix and the effects of the previously mentioned securities portfolio transactions.", "Relative to the prior year, margin is up 31 basis points and this improvement is driven primarily by the lower funding cost discussed earlier. We currently expect margin to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter and the risk and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide.", "So let\u2019s move on to provision on slide 11. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $615 million, down $47 million from the second quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Provision expense was $75 million less than charge-offs with $5 million of this differential coming from a reduction in the unfunded commitments reserve that we hold due to the improved credit quality related to certain commercial and large corporate clients.", "Charge-offs were $690 million, a decrease of $32 million or 4%, compared to last quarter. The decline occurred in most product categories and was partially offset by an anticipated increase in commercial real estate and a very small increase in residential mortgage.", "The allowance ratio declined from 2.81% to 2.69%, as a result of both the decrease in the allowance as well as the increase in period-end loan balances. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in loans is the result of increases in high-quality consumer, commercial and government guaranteed mortgage loans, partially offset by declines in the higher risk categories including construction and home equity. Tom will cover asset quality in more detail in a few minutes, so let\u2019s move on to noninterest income on slide 12.", "On a reported basis, noninterest income was up 10% sequentially and 35% from the prior year. We\u2019ve adjusted for a number of items in each quarter and after the adjustments, noninterest income increased by 19 and 17% respectively. The adjustments primarily relate to fair value marks and securities gains and as in prior quarters, we provided the underlying detail in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation.", "In the current quarter, the largest adjustments are for $69 million in securities gains and a net of $10 million in mark-to-market losses on securities and our fair value debt and related hedges. As mentioned previously, the main drivers of the sequential quarter increase in noninterest income relates to our investment banking and mortgage businesses and key items of note in this quarter\u2019s noninterest income results include investment banking income increasing by 66% or $38 million to a record level of $96 million in the quarter.", "This result was driven by strong syndication, bond origination and merger and acquisition revenues. Mortgage production income increased $150 million, driven by an increase in application volume of over 25%, increased production margins and a $53 million decrease in the cost of mortgage repurchases which I\u2019ll cover in more detail in just a minute.", "Mortgage servicing income increased $44 million or 51% as compared to the prior quarter, due almost entirely to hedge performance. Trading income actually declined $130 million in the quarter, which needs a little more explanation. The majority of the decline was caused by mark-to-market losses on our publicly traded debt and related hedges of $22 million in the current quarter as compared to gains of $63 million in the second quarter.", "Not included in the adjustments on this page is an additional mark-to-market loss of $59 million on index-linked certificates of deposit. In prior quarters, the marks on these deposits which total about $1.2 billion, have been relatively insignificant and mostly positive.", "Tightening of SunTrust credit spreads and the declining interest rates in the current quarter resulted in a $59 million loss this period. A view excluding the impact of the mark on index-linked CDs and the items included in the appendix reflected increase in trading income driven largely by fixed income and derivatives trading.", "Now, the final item, I will note is the decline in service charges on deposit accounts of $24 million or 11%. This reduction is related to the implementation of the required Reg E changes and the voluntary changes that we have made to our fee schedules that Jim talked about earlier.", "Our voluntary changes were in place for the entire quarter and the Reg E changes were effective August 15th. As a result, we expect a full quarter of Reg E to have a negative sequential quarter impact going into the fourth quarter, with some mitigating impact from increased client opt-in and a typical seasonal increase.", "Let\u2019s now turn to slide 13 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. The noninterest income impact of mortgage repurchases decreased $53 million this quarter. The reduction was primarily due to lower charge-offs, coupled with a smaller increase in reserves.", "Repurchase losses declined in part due to the implementation in the quarter of an enhanced review process and in part due to a decline of the average loan size of the volume process. In addition, new request volumes declined back to the levels more consistent with the first quarter and resulted in a basically stable population of pending requests. However, new request volume remains volatile from month-to-month and as such, future results are difficult to estimate with precision.", "If third quarter trends continue and they have so far in October, our current expectation is that fourth quarter charge-offs will increase back closer to the second quarter levels. However, if -- and I want to emphasize if, new request volumes remain stable, our current view is that reserve additions in the fourth quarter will be roughly stable with the third quarter, despite the expected increase in charge-offs.", "Now, said another way, we expect the income statement impact in the fourth quarter to remain relatively stable with that realized in the third quarter at this time. Now, of course, all of this is related to the assumptions that I\u2019ve just walked you through.", "The key points from the bottom part of this slide are slightly altered from prior quarters. Most of our current request volume is coming from the higher loss vintages of 2007 and prior years and this has continued longer than we originally expected. We continue to expect, however, that normal seasoning patterns for origination vintages overtime will shift new request volume to newer vintages.", "As that occurs, we expect lower request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as the newer vintages exhibit more favorable characteristics as depicted on the bottom right of slide 13. The last point I\u2019ll make on this topic does not have a reference point on the slide.", "The topic is the recent speculation regarding repurchase liability for non-agency loan sales. So first, let me put the numbers into perspective. The timeframe we should focus on is 2005 through 2007 as we had very few of such sales in 2008. The total sales volume of non-agency product during this timeframe is approximately $30 billion and the remaining unpaid balance today is roughly $17 billion.", "In addition, the composition of our non-agency sales is dramatically different than from the industry produced over this time frame. For example, our percentage of prime non-agency productions sold was approximately 56%, with the balance being generally high quality, low doc production.", "By contrast, external data sources show the total industry with a much lower composition of prime product loan sales. Finally, we have not had a material volume of repurchase requests on non-agency sales to date, nor have we sustained losses of a substantial nature.", "So with that, let me turn to slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was flat when compared to last quarter and increased 5% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Adjusting for a few items that are detailed in the appendix of today\u2019s presentation, expenses increased 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the third quarter of last year.", "At the bottom of the slide, we\u2019ve included the three primary drivers of the sequential quarter increase which combined drove the majority of the change. Personnel-related expenses are the biggest contributor and the majority of the growth is associated with improved revenue generation.", "Incentive compensation associated with mortgage, investment banking performance increased as you would expect. Further, of the increase in headcount of approximately 350, the majority is related to mortgage production. The remaining increase is largely related to investment in personnel in our technology area and revenue producers in other lines of business.", "As I mentioned earlier, we are seeking to balance current expenses against investment in future revenue and this is an example. The other area of growth is embedded within other noninterest expense and on the slide we\u2019ve removed credit-related expenses and adjustments from the appendix of the presentation to highlight this embedded increase.", "The reconciliation for this line is in the appendix as well. The increase of $17 million you see on the slide is more than 100% associated with legal-related costs. And while future litigation-related expenses are never certain, our current expectation is that these costs will not recur next quarter.", "So with that overview of our third quarter results, I will turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality in more detail. Tom?", "Tom Freeman", "Thanks Mark. This morning, I\u2019m going to review our asset quality beginning on slide 15. As Mark and Jim noted earlier in the call, asset quality continued to improve this quarter. Charge-offs, provision expense, non-performing loans and non-performing assets all decreased.", "Loan balances increased and overall delinquencies were basically stable. Net charge-offs during the second quarter were $690 million, down $32 million from last quarter. Charge-offs continued to be heavily concentrated in the residential real estate related portfolios, including residential mortgages, construction and home equity.", "The net charge-off ratio declined from 2.57% to 2.42% with most portfolios showing improvement. Stable mortgage and higher commercial real estate charge-offs were the exceptions to this declining trend and I\u2019ll talk about these more in a moment.", "Provision expense declined as a result of lower charge-offs. In addition, with improved asset quality metrics in the current quarter and an outlook for continued gradual improvement, the allowance for loan losses was reduced by a modest $70 million. The allowance to loan ratio declined to 2.69% of loans or 12 basis points.", "With roughly half the decline related to lower reserves, the other half of the decline is related to higher loan balances. As Mark mentioned earlier, the portfolio mix continued to improve, with higher risk portfolio balances like construction continuing to decline and growth occurring in both higher quality and federally guaranteed portfolios.", "Nonperforming loans declined during the quarter by over $325 million or 7%. This is a fifth consecutive quarter of declining nonperforming loans. Owned real estate also declined resulting in nonperforming assets declining by nearly $400 million.", "Aggressive problem asset resolution coupled with continuing trending of lower inflows into nonperforming drove the decline in the current quarter. Early stage delinquencies remained basically stable during the quarter. Delinquencies are currently below 1% after excluding government guaranteed loans.", "The early stage delinquencies have declined significantly since the beginning of 2009. While the economic and employment environments have remained sluggish. As a result, we do not expect significant further improvement in overall early stage delinquencies until general economic conditions improve.", "Please turn to slide 16 for review of loan portfolios. This slide provides a net charge-off and early stage delinquency metric by loan type. It illustrates on a more granular level that overall asset quality has improved and that asset quality issues remain concentrated in the residential real estate portfolios.", "Charge-offs declined broadly among the portfolios. Early stage delinquencies were stable to down and balances in some of the higher risk portfolios continue to decline. Commercial portfolio continues to perform well with early stage delinquencies, non-performing loans and charge-offs stable to down in the quarter.", "Charge-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio increased to just over 1% of loans on an annualized basis. While a significant increase in the annualized charge-off rate, the actual dollars involved were relatively low, with charge-offs in the segment totaling $40 million.", "We expect some additional stress and charge-offs in this portfolio as the economic cycle plays out. However, the timing of problem resolution in commercial real estate can be varied. Overall, we continue to believe that this portfolio will perform comparatively well given its composition, the quality of underwriting and our ongoing management disciplines. Evidence of this can be seen in the relatively low and stable levels of non-performing loans and delinquencies.", "As a reminder, this portfolio is largely owner occupied and has an average loan size of about $700,000 overall. The average loan size of investor real estate loans is about $1.1 million. Asset quality is generally improved in the consumer portfolios with stable-to-lower early stage delinquencies and charge-offs.", "We provided additional detail this quarter on the consumer direct portfolio, to highlight the relatively high delinquency and relatively low losses contained in the student loan portfolio. Student loans comprise two-thirds of the consumer direct portfolio and roughly 90% of the student loans are government guaranteed.", "I\u2019m going to talk about each of the higher risk residential real estate secured and construction portfolios in the next few slides. In general, balances in these portfolios continue to decline and they are disciplined generally stable to improving performance with construction continuing to show some variability.", "Mortgage charge-offs increased slightly this quarter but our outlook for charge-offs in the residential mortgage portfolio continues to be stable to improve. Next I\u2019m going to briefly review a more detailed presentation of our residential mortgage portfolio on slide 17.", "Asset quality in the residential mortgage portfolio continued to show overall improvement in terms of nonperforming loans and delinquencies driven in large part by performance in the core portfolio. Growth in the core mortgage portfolio was due to the origination and retention of mortgages that have Federal Government guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA.", "This government guaranteed subset of the core portfolio increased by over $1.2 billion during the quarter and now stands at over $3 billion. A non-core portion of the portfolio continued its declining trend during the quarter, dropping by over $300 million.", "Non-performing balances declined in every segment of this portfolio during the quarter. Total delinquencies declined seven basis points overall, driven down by small decrease in the core portfolio and larger declines in the home equity loan and lot loan portfolio segments.", "Despite stable sequential charge-offs, delinquency trends in this portfolio continued to point to reduced frequency of over the next quarter or two. We expect home prices to remain soft overall, trending down in some markets and stable to modestly up in others.", "We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable to declining non-performing loan and charge-off levels over the next quarter or two. There are some risks to this generally improving outlook.", "The first is the pace of economic recovery and more specifically unemployment rates and housing prices. The second risk relates to the foreclosure process. SunTrust is reviewing pending foreclosures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and practices. We take this issue very seriously and we\u2019re pursuing it aggressively.", "While technical issues may arise in the preparation of any legal document, we are taking this opportunity to resolve any issues which are uncovered. We have completed this review process for the states of Florida, Georgia and North Carolina. These states account for approximately 85 or 80% of the unit volume in our portfolio.", "To provide some context regarding the impact to SunTrust, in Florida which represents about 70% of our foreclosure activity, we have less than 300 loans scheduled for hearings in the next 60 to 90 days. As a result, we do not expect any required rescheduling to have a material impact on the resolution of our mortgage non-accruals.", "We\u2019ll now move to slide 18 to discuss home equity lines. Home equity portfolio balances and charge-offs continued to decline, while nonaccruals were relatively stable. Over two-thirds of the portfolio is labeled as core and is performing reasonably well. The rest of the portfolio is running off with no new production and little to no line availability.", "As you would expect, elevated credit metrics are largely driven by these higher risk segments. These include lines originated by third parties, lines in Florida and other states with high loan to value ratios.", "Now, if you turn to slide 19, I\u2019ll talk about our construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce our exposure to higher risk construction loans with balances dropping another 11% during the third quarter. Balances are down 40% on a year-over-year basis while overall charge-offs were down sequentially, they remain elevated and uneven.", "The amount and timing of construction charge-offs are variable due to the nature of the workout process. In addition, commercial construction loans are typically larger and more complex than consumer construction loans and introduce another element of variability.", "As you can see on this slide, residential construction has been the most problematic construction portfolio. We expect that charge-offs related to these loans will remain elevated and somewhat variable over the next few quarters as we continue to work through this rapidly declining portfolio.", "Commercial construction balances continue to decline and this portfolio has generally performed better than its residential counterpart but it too has demonstrated, elevated and somewhat variable charge-offs. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased for the second straight quarter but are expected to remain elevated. We believe that residential construction nonperforming levels will be stable to down with modest increases in nonperforming commercial construction loans.", "The overall construction delinquency ratio increased quarter-over-quarter. However, this was driven by lower portfolio balances rather than by an increase in the dollars delinquent which remains stable.", "Next, I\u2019m going to review loan modification results on slide 20 of today\u2019s presentation. Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.5 billion at the end of the quarter and performance continued to be at an acceptable level with 86% of accruing restructured loans remaining current on principal and interest payments.", "Balances of accruing TDRs increased by roughly $250 million during the current quarter as compared to approximately $360 million last quarter. The vast majority, 97%, of accruing TDRs are consumer, residential-related loans. The slowing growth trends in residential TDRs continued and the pace of newly delinquent loans eligible for restructure decreased.", "Overall, the performance of the accruing TDRs continued to exceed our expectations during the third quarter. Accruing TDRs have a weighted average age of 12 months, evidencing a level of sustained performance. With 94% of accruing TDRs being current or one payment past due, the performance of this portfolio remained much closer to traditional mortgage portfolios than our restructured portfolio.", "Before turning the call back over to Steve, I\u2019m going to provide a brief summary of today\u2019s asset quality review on slide 21. Overall, asset quality continued to improve in the quarter. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined. Delinquencies were stable to down in most of the portfolios. However, we do not expect significant additional improvements in overall early stage delinquencies until economic conditions strengthen.", "Charge-offs declined modestly overall, with most portfolios stable to down. Commercial real estate charge-offs increased as specific problem loans were resolved. Given continuing stress in this segment, the timing and amount of future commercial real estate charge-offs will remain variable and elevated.", "Mortgage asset quality metrics were stable or improved. We continue to aggressively and successfully reduce the risk in the construction portfolio as evidenced by additional balance reductions, lower non-performing loans and elevated charge-off levels. Accruing TDRs remain predominantly centered around consumer mortgages. Balances increased modestly in the quarter and solid payment performance continued.", "At the current time, we expect overall credit quality to improve again in the fourth quarter, with total net charge-offs stable to slightly down and nonperformers declining modestly. Finally, at this point in the cycle, we expect the allowance for loan losses to continue to trend downward at a pace consistent with the improvement in credit quality.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Steve.", "Steve Shriner", "Operator, I think we\u2019re ready to take our first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) The first question is from Matthew O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, guys.", "Jim Wells", "Good morning.", "Mark Chancy", "Good morning. ", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Regarding the private label mortgages that you sold or securitized, do you have any more color on the LTVs or the FICO scores or how the loans are actually performing?", "Mark Chancy", "Matt, it\u2019s Mark Chancy. How are you?", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good. ", "Mark Chancy", "You know, the data that we are providing, let me just run back through it. So we\u2019ve got the information that we\u2019re putting out publicly today. We have about $30 billion of non-agency related product that was sold during the \u201805 to \u201807 period with $17 billion that\u2019s currently unpaid principal balance. What we noted in the call was that 56% of that $30 billion is prime-related product including prime jumbo loans with the remaining 44% high quality, low doc loans.", "The non-agency product is included in our reserve process but we\u2019ve had few requests to date and few losses and the bulk of the reserves that we\u2019ve been talking about and that we show in our presentation materials relate to the agency products. You\u2019ll recall that total reserve is around $270 million, which was up $14 million. But as far as the individual statistics of the various loans by vintage, we just have not put that out in the public domain at this point.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just separately, I know as companies start to become profitable, the tax rate can get all funky. If you could just remind us of what the recurring tax credits are and how long we should assume they stick around?", "Steve Shriner", "", "Hey, Matt. This is Steve. You know, you\u2019ll notice that with a pretax, I think it was around $170 million or so this quarter, we posted a small tax provision. If you compare that to our historical kind of at run rate earnings of call it 30 to 32%, what you\u2019ll see is excluding discrete items, you should get a fairly linear function for tax rate going forward between that near breakeven level we\u2019re at today and that long-term rate of 30 to 32% as we return to a run rate of earnings in the future. Does that help?", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I guess it\u2019s just going to be -- it will probably take a couple years to get back to that normal tax rate, right? So as we\u2019re modeling it out, is there a kind of tax credit that we should assume each quarter plus a rate on top of that?", "Steve Shriner", "Well, with $170 million in pretax and tax liability of 14, you can assume that we have a permanent GAAP tax differences that shelter somewhere around $150 million of taxable income every quarter.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just lastly, if I may, the page on capital where you show 8% Tier 1 common, just to be clear, is that under the Basel III calculation?", "Steve Shriner", "Yeah.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And so I guess there\u2019s not any meaningful change in RWAs or anything like that?", "Mark Chancy", "We have not made, let me clarify. We do not have any current significant adjustment to the capital calculation associated with things like DTA and SSR. So as we sit here today, that\u2019s an immaterial effect on our overall calculation, so we basically just provided to you a straight calculation of our Tier 1 common but you should assume that those two things as of today are basically equivalent at 8%.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "I guess if they adopt the OCI or if the U.S. adopts the OCI rule, there\u2019s some Coke stock that is not included in regulatory capital that we would add back.", "Mark Chancy", "I\u2019ll get back to you on that, Matt. Just to be clear.", "Matthew O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Nancy Bush from NAB Research.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Mark Chancy", "Good morning.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Jim, could you just speak to the whole foreclosure moratorium issue and where SunTrust kind of sits in the spectrum of what\u2019s going on right now? That\u2019s my first question.", "Jim Wells", "Well, as you heard from Tom, Nancy, we have, 70% of our activity is in Florida and the number there of loans in the next period of time for hearing is less than $300 million. At the same time -- excuse me, 300 loans. Sorry.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Big difference.", "Jim Wells", "I will correct it. 300 loans. And I guess what I would say to you is that I think the results of all this furor will be variable based on institutions and how many loans they\u2019ve been working on and how they\u2019ve done it. We\u2019re just trying to be very clear and very cautious, making sure we comply with everything we need to comply with, but the effects so far have been limited. Now, what happens to others, honestly I don\u2019t know and I find reading the press not particularly helpful about that.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Okay. Secondly, the big increase you had in nonperform -- pardon me, in non-interest bearing deposits from sequentially, could you just speak to the sort of new account acquisition trends that may be embedded in that and how that big number came about?", "Jim Wells", "I\u2019m going to let Bill Rogers answer that one, Nancy.", "Bill Rogers", "Hey, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Hi.", "Bill Rogers", "We have been -- the whole transition in the deposit mix from learning CDs, single service CDs, okay, and really high focus on money market and demand. You can see the impact of that, but really underlying all that is the focus on household growth.", "I mean, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to accomplish and on an annualized basis we\u2019re somewhere in the 3% to 4% in total household growth which is where the focus is. And checking accounts box asking sort of have a lot of variability around them but that\u2019s the focus.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Are you seeing any impact, Bill, as \u2013 I mean, Wells Fargo, I guess has now changed the name on the building and they are sort of beginning to make its presence better known there and I think JPM is being pretty aggressive in the market, although they may be more aggressive on the loan side. Are you seeing any kind of shift as the competitive situation changes there?", "Bill Rogers", "I think the answer would be -- it\u2019s always been really competitive in our markets and we\u2019ve never been better positioned from a competitive standpoint.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Are you guys beginning to sort of tout hometown bank advantage that sort of thing a bit more?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive on the marketing side in Atlanta. This is -- particularly here, this is our home turf here and we\u2019ve been -- we have been and will be highly protective of our franchise.", "Jim Wells", "Thank you, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush \u2013 NAB Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mike Mayo from CLSA.", "Tom Sherlock \u2013 CLSA", "Yeah. Hi. Good morning. This is [Tom Sherlock] filling in for Mike. I just had a follow-up on your loan utilization. You mentioned that it is flat to slightly down in some categories. I just want to see if you can give more color on what the actual percentages are in the different areas and where you expect that to go?", "Bill Rogers", "Yeah. I\u2019ll handle that. It\u2019s Bill again. On the large corporate side it\u2019s sort of generally in the 17% kind of range and that\u2019s pretty much all-time lows. Generally that could be somewhere in the mid to high 20s, sort of on an average kind of basis and on the commercial -- sort of commercial, middle market basis it\u2019s in the low 30s and has historically averaged somewhere in the low to mid-40s. And it has for the last three quarters sort of -- the rate of decline has abated. But we\u2019re sort of bobbling around those kind of numbers.", "Tom Sherlock \u2013 CLSA", "Okay. So you would expect that to maybe go a little bit farther down?", "Bill Rogers", "No, no, I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m just saying it sort of has hovered consistently in the last three quarters.", "Tom Sherlock \u2013 CLSA", "Okay. That\u2019s would be consistent. Okay.", "Bill Rogers", "I would hope that we would start to see some kind of increase, depending on some type of economic recovery and then certain parts of our business, middle market would be the example, I mean, the commitments are going up. So we\u2019re increasing our at bats and increasing our relationships, but the utilization rate\u2019s still low.", "Tom Sherlock \u2013 CLSA", "Got it. Great. Thank you.", "Jim Wells", "Okay. We\u2019ve got time for one more, I think.", "Operator", "The next question is from David Hilder from Susquehanna.", "David Hilder \u2013 Susquehanna", "Good morning. Actually, two quick questions. First, Tom I think mentioned that you have been putting some agency mortgages on the balance sheet and I wondered what your appetite for that is going forward and what your interest rate management strategy would be, assuming they\u2019re 30 year fixed paper.", "Jim Wells", "If you don\u2019t mind, let\u2019s get Mark to answer that.", "Mark Chancy", "Yeah. This is Mark Chancy. We have added as we mentioned a little over $1 billion worth of that product during the quarter. We have other aspects of the mortgage portfolio that have been driving and as a result, this is somewhat of an offset, if you will, to that attrition. We\u2019re not looking to grow the overall on balance sheet mortgage portfolio significantly. We\u2019re trying to continue to de-risk our overall loan portfolio and add back quality assets, particularly in this case with a government guarantee.", "One of the things that you\u2019ll note in our earnings release is that during the -- we have over the course of the past couple of quarters both added mortgage loans with the guarantee as well as certain student loans as well as other product that is government guaranteed, such that the total is now about 7% of our total loan book or about $8 billion.", "So it\u2019s certainly something to take into consideration as you\u2019re looking on a forward basis at both our improving credit trends as well as the de-risking that\u2019s taken place in the higher risk portfolio and where the growth has come is on the margin in some of these government guaranteed areas as well as the consumer book that we outlined during the presentation. So you shouldn\u2019t expect to see that mortgage portfolio grow significantly over the course of the next couple quarters.", "David Hilder \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful, very helpful. And then back to page six on the Basel III calculation, you said that you wouldn\u2019t have much of an impact because of MSR or DTA on the numerator, but I think what Matt may have been asking about was the impact of the Basel III rules on the denominator, the RWA amount.", "Mark Chancy", "At this point based on the calculation that\u2019s we have made, we don\u2019t expect any significant effect on the calculation under the new rules.", "David Hilder \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay. Thanks. Thanks very much.", "Mark Chancy", "Thank you.", "Jim Wells", "It\u2019s 5, although, it looks like we have time for one more.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bob Patten from Morgan Keegan.", "Bob Patten \u2013 Morgan Keegan", "Hey, good morning, everybody.", "Jim Wells", "Good morning.", "Bob Patten Morgan Keegan", "What\u2019s your thoughts about the mortgage production, if you talked about this I apologize but just in terms of the look forward, do you continue to see several more quarters of strong, this type of mortgage production.", "Bill Rogers", "This is Bill. I can\u2019t say for several quarters. Our application\u2019s been up in the 27 or so percent in the last quarter. Rates certainly have continued at an attractive pace and we\u2019re on that pace again through where we are in October. How long that will continue, given the fact that the bulk of this activity is refinance, I mean, eventually we\u2019re going to have to have some purchase volume for that to continue at this kind of pace.", "Bob Patten Morgan Keegan", "Okay. Thanks, Bill, appreciate it.", "Jim Wells", "There are no more questions. We will end the call. Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] I'd like to introduce Mr. Kris Dickson. He is the Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Good morning, and welcome to SunTrust's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. Slide 2 outlines the content, which includes an overview of the quarter, financial results and a review of credit quality. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "With me today, among other members of our executive team, are Jim Wells, our Chief Executive Officer; Bill Rogers, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Mark Chancy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer. Jim will start the call with an overview of the quarter. Mark will then discuss financial performance, and Tom will conclude with a review of asset quality. At the conclusion of the formal remarks, we'll open the session for questions.", "Before I get started, I need to remind you our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "Further, we do not intend to update any forward-looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made, and we disclaim any responsibility to do so. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.", "James Wells", "Good morning, everybody, and I'm glad to have you with us this morning, and thank you, Kris. I think you have great skills displayed in the reading of the synopsis of the forward-looking statement declaration.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thank you.", "James Wells", "I'm impressed. Also would like to thank Steve Shriner, who I hope is on the phone this morning as well. He has accepted the position of Chief Retail Credit Officer in our Corporate Risk group. And I want to thank Steve for great work over the past few years. ", "And before discussing the fourth quarter, I would like to take a moment to share a few accomplishments of SunTrust in 2010, as we finish the year on a much more positive note than it began. A few examples. We returned to profitability during the year and posted a full year profit before preferred dividends. Our low-cost deposits grew 10% over the course of the year and demonstrating our success in increasing client loyalty and growing market share. Revenue expanded and benefited from a 17 basis point expansion in the net interest margin, as well as from solid performance from several of our key businesses. Credit quality improved throughout the year with quarterly declines in net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonperforming loans. And our capital ratios remains strong and even expanded.", "Returning to the fourth quarter, our earnings of $114 million or $0.23 per share improved compared to last year, as well as last quarter, mostly driven by a lower provision, with the result of improved credit quality and solid revenue. We're pleased with the diversity of our revenue sources and continued to improvement in credit quality. Net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined compared to the third quarter and are significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2009.", "While our financial performance is still not to the level that we or our shareholders desire, we did make additional progress in demonstrating improved results and in executing our strategies to drive  longer-term growth. The operating environment unquestionably remains challenging, and obviously, it's been an active period from a regulatory and legislative standpoint. ", "So let's turn to Slide 4. As we've said previously, financial regulation will impact our financial results going forward. Some new proposals were issued during the quarter, and the effects of certain aspects of regulatory reform are becoming clearer. This slide highlights selected items of interest, though it's not intended to be all-inclusive. Our guidance regarding deposit  service charges, Reg E issues and derivatives remains unchanged and outlined in the chart. It appears the Fed certainly followed the letter of the Dodd-Frank law, with its recent proposal on debit interchange. Like most in the industry, we are very concerned about any government efforts to impose price controls. And we additionally believe the Fed's proposal does not adequately recognize many of the costs associated with providing debit card services. We, of course, have been actively working to make our views known to the regulators as well as to Congress.", "The regulation is still in the comment period, and we're hopeful that any final regulation takes into account a less narrow interpretation of costs that would include at a minimum fraud losses, fraud prevention costs and servicing costs associated with operating a debit card business. Should the proposed rules be enacted, then we obviously expect a material impact to this revenue stream beginning in the second half of 2011. I would note that the approximately 75% revenue estimate does not take into account actions that we are pursuing to help mitigate this decline.", "Turning to the current deposit insurance proposal. The calculation will be based on net assets not on deposits, which will obviously raise our assessment base.  That said, the calculation will also become more complex and sensitive to a variety of trailing trends and factors, such as credit concentrations, risks and earnings. If the proposal is adopted as it is today, we expect that over time, the higher assessment base will be partially mitigated as improving operating trends are reflected in the calculation.", "While all of this may lead to some volatility in our quarterly expenses, we do not expect a significant increase in our 2011 expense base. With respect to capital as we disclosed last quarter, our Tier 1 common ratio is in excess of 8%, currently above the 2019 Basel III 7% requirement. Based upon our understanding of the Basel III calculation, we expect a modest benefit to our Tier 1 common ratio, which I'll cover shortly. And lastly, we currently expect about 170 basis points impact to our Tier 1 capital ratio over a three-year period, beginning in 2013 from the Collins amendment. ", "Let's take a minute and look at capital on Slide 5. Our regulatory capital ratios increased again this quarter as they have in previous quarters as highlighted on the slide. Estimated Tier 1 common increased to a healthy 8.08%. The tangible common equity ratio and book values per share declined modestly due to declines in unrealized gains from rising rates during the quarter.", "But before I turn the call over to Mark, I'd like to take a moment to offer some context on Basel III, Slide 6. The bottom line is that our Tier 1 common ratio today already exceeds the Basel III standard that will not be effective until 2019. Our Tier 1 common ratio increases approximately 30 basis points under the Basel III calculation to 8.4% or about $1.9 billion more than the 7% standard. ", "As you know, the Basel III framework is one of the lenses through which the Federal Reserve will be revaluating [ph] bank's capital plans submitted as part of the comprehensive capital plan review process. SunTrust submitted its capital plan to the Federal Reserve in early January as requested. Given that the Federal Reserve's review of that plan is still in process and that it is a confidential regulatory exam, we won't be providing any specifics contained in the plan today.", "I will, however, offer a few high-level thoughts on prioritization of future capital actions. As we have said, we have been and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support the future growth opportunities and to be consistent with our responsibilities to shareholders. We plan to continue making these investments in order to grow the business. And at the same time, we also recognize the value of returning capital to shareholders. And in that regard, our priorities are repaying TARP and in due time after that, increasing the common dividend.", "I'll now take a moment to comment on TARP. Our repayment strategy has been very deliberate, and it has had the best interest of our shareholders in mind. We believe our patience has been appropriate as it has enabled us to deliver meaningful improvements in our performance, which among other things has resulted in an increased stock price. I do ultimately expect that we will have to issue some equity to exit TARP as that has been the precedent today. You may have noted that Fifth Third highlighted its pro forma Tier 1 common ratio of 9% in its announcement. Several of our other large bank peers are also currently around this level. To the extent that peer review and/or a 9% number are relevant, a more modest capital raise for SunTrust than we've seen in some precedent transactions might be required. There is now a quantitative framework through which TARP repayment is going to be evaluated, and that being the Fed's comprehensive capital plan review. We're certainly supportive of this review process, and it is expected to be completed by late March.", "We expect that our 8.4% Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and our reduced risk profile will serve us well in this process. That said, this is obviously a very comprehensive review that the Fed is conducting, and we don't have the results as yet. Once the review process is complete, we'll be in a better position to re-evaluate our repayment options and the appropriate timing.", "Looking forward, we believe SunTrust is well positioned as we enter 2011. Our efforts to drive improved operational execution and client loyalty are yielding results and will remain a priority for us. We're taking advantage of opportunities in our markets and will continue to make investments in teammate engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships, the three areas that we believe drive market share growth and ultimately, higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders. ", "And with those comments, I'll turn the call over to Mark for more detail on financial results.", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with a review of the summary income statement on Slide 7. For the quarter, we posted net income to common shareholders of $114 million or $0.23 per share. This represents a $0.06 increase from the $0.17 per share that we reported in the third quarter. Results were driven by a decline in the provision due to improved credit quality, as well as stable revenue relative to the strong results that we reported last quarter.", "We'll discuss the quarter in more depth on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit a few of the highlights. Net interest income increased 2% or $28 million relative to the third quarter and grew 7% or $89 million as compared to the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was driven by the continued favorable shift in the deposit mix and lower deposit pricing. We also saw a modest increase in loan balances in the quarter. The provision declined $103 million or 17% from the third quarter due to lower net charge-offs and a modest reduction in the allowance. Noninterest income declined sequentially by $5 million or about 1% as mortgage revenue was lower on the heels of the strong refinance activities that occurred in the third quarter. This decline was partially offset by higher trading income, as well as increases in other market-sensitive revenues.", "Noninterest expenses increased $49 million or 3% from the prior quarter due primarily to investments in the business, including technology, marketing and personnel, as well as higher incentive compensation in certain business lines. As we have done in the past, we adjust for several items, including securities and mark-to-market gains, when presenting our core revenue and expense figures. The total net adjustments this quarter contributed $88 million to pretax earnings. So even excluding these items, we delivered another profitable quarter before and after TARP dividends, consistent with our guidance in December.", "For the full year 2010, we reported positive net income before preferred dividends of $189 million and a net loss to common shareholders of $87 million or $0.18 per share. As Jim mentioned, both of these results improved meaningfully compared to 2009, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2009.", "Our results for the full year and for the fourth quarter are still not near the levels where we would like them to be. But we are pleased with the progress that we made over the course of 2010, and we believe that we're well positioned as we enter 2011 to realize further improvement in our financial performance. ", "With that, let's shift to Slide 8 for a review of loans and deposits. Average loan balances, excluding nonaccruals, were up $1.9 billion or 2% as compared to the third quarter. Growth was driven by higher commercial and consumer loans, which more than offset our continued efforts to manage down the Construction portfolio. Growth within the commercial category was split between large corporate and smaller commercial clients. Within our Corporate and Investment Banking business unit, growth came from higher balances in our asset-backed commercial paper conduit facility, while utilization rates overall remained stable and at relatively low levels. Growth in diversified commercial banking was due to a 2 percentage point pick-up in utilization rates. It is too early to declare this increase a trend as there was likely some year-end inventory building that contributed to it, but we were pleased to see higher demand in this area that we are targeting for future loan growth.", "Average balance growth within the consumer direct category was largely from the consolidation of an approximate $500 million student loan securitization, which occurred at the end of the third quarter. Consumer indirect growth came primarily from auto loan purchases that occurred during both the third and fourth quarters, including an approximate $900 million portfolio acquisition that we closed in December.  We have been opportunistic with these transactions as we have found them to have attractive return and credit characteristics. ", "Now turning to deposits. We continued to see a favorable shift in the mix towards low-cost accounts. DDA, NOW and Money Market Accounts all increased 5% sequentially. These categories grew a combined $4.3 billion over their average balance levels in the third quarter, while higher cost time deposits declined almost $2 billion. This shift helped drive further expansion on our net interest margin, which I'm going to discuss here in a minute.", "Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, low-cost deposits grew 10% or $8.5 billion. Concurrently, higher cost, time and wholesale deposit sources declined 25% or about the same amount, $8.4 billion. While we acknowledge that a portion of the low-cost deposit growth is attributable to clients holding higher levels of liquidity, we also believe that the growth is the direct result of investments that we have made to enhance our clients' banking experience and to drive households and market share growth.", "Now let's turn to Slide 9 for a discussion of the Securities portfolio. Our total available-for-sale portfolio stood at $26.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down $3.4 billion from the end of the third quarter. In anticipation of higher interest rates, we decreased the investment portfolio's risk profile through the sale of longer-dated securities and recognized $64 million in securities gains in the process. The sales were primarily in agency mortgage-backed and treasury securities. And going forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our risk to a further steepening of the yield curve through additional repositioning. Despite the significant increase in rates during the quarter, the unrealized gain in the bond portfolio was approximately $440 million, albeit down from $830 million at the end of the third quarter.", "Now I'm going to move to margin on Slide 10. The net interest margin expanded for the seventh consecutive quarter and was up three basis points sequentially to 3.44%. The expansion was once again driven by  lower funding costs, the direct result of our low-cost deposit growth and continued management of our rates paid by product and by market. Relative to the prior year, margin is up 17 basis points, and this improvement was primarily caused by a 38 basis point decline in rates paid on our interest-bearing liabilities. While earning asset yields were down about 17 basis points due to the low rate environment, our strong focus on loan pricing and our commercial loans swap position both help to mitigate the impact of lower rates. We expect the margin as we move into 2011 to remain relatively stable in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, and the risks and opportunities to this view are listed on the slide.", "Let's transition now to provision on Slide 11. Tom Freeman will cover credit quality in detail shortly so I'll be brief here. Total provision for credit losses for the quarter was $512 million, down $103 million from the third quarter as credit trends continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined by $69 million or about 10% in the quarter, with the largest improvements coming in residential mortgage and construction. ", "Additional credit metrics such as nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined in the quarter. As such, the allowance was reduced by $112 million, and that reduction combined with loan growth reduced the allowance-to-loans ratio by 11 basis points. ", "Let's move now to noninterest income on Slide 12. On a reported basis, noninterest income was down 1% sequentially but up 39% from the prior year. And as I mentioned earlier, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments can be found in the appendix. And after these adjustments, noninterest income, while down 6% sequentially, was up 30% from the prior year. ", "Now there were three significant swings in our sequential quarter fee income, which you see listed at the bottom of the page, including declines in mortgage production and servicing and an increase in trading. Note that these items are also reported on an adjusted basis in order to be consistent with the figures presented at the top of the page. ", "Adjusted mortgage production declined about $90 million as rising interest rates resulted in a decline in locked loan volume, as well as reduced production margins. Mortgage servicing declined $64 million as rate volatility during the quarter led to reduced hedge performance and an increase in prepayment activity. Adjusted trading income increased $76 million. Now this was primarily due to the $59 million fair value loss that we recognized in the third quarter on our indexed link CDs.  And as we discussed last quarter, that was an unusually high loss, and it compares to a $5 million gain recognized during the fourth quarter.", "Our consumer and commercial fee income categories also generally performed well. And most notably, investment banking income posted another record quarter and eclipsed the $100 million mark for the period. Syndications accounted for an atypically high proportion of the revenue this quarter, as a number of transactions were closed toward the end of the year on robust deal flow. Trust and retail investment income also increased sequentially, while deposit service charges declined due to the full quarter impact of Reg E. Overall, we were pleased that the diversity of our revenue sources enabled us to post strong year-over-year fee growth and solid sequential results amidst lower mortgage volume and reduced deposit service charges.", "Let's now turn to Slide 13 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. We have altered this slide compared to previous quarters in order to provide you some additional color on this topic. The top left portion shows that the income statement impact of mortgage repurchases decreased to $85 million in the fourth quarter, down $10 million from the third quarter, while charge-offs increased $9 million as expected. The mortgage repurchase reserve was reduced modestly, which is consistent with the declines experienced during the quarter in both the pending demands and new repurchase request volume, which are the topics we'll shift our attention to next. As depicted in the top right, pending demands declined by $27 million or about 8% to $293 million at the end of the quarter. And I'll come back to the non-agency figures that you see in just a minute.", "The bottom left chart depicts repurchase request volume by vintage. In total, repurchase volume was down $30 million in the quarter. The 2006 and 2007 vintages continue to comprise the bulk of the requests, though 2007 requests were down $26 million sequentially. And as we've indicated previously, new demands can be volatile and are difficult to forecast, but we do expect over time that normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in requests from the 2006 and 2007 vintages. And as that occurs, we expect lower aggregate request volumes and lower loss frequencies and severities as newer vintages exhibit more favorable credit characteristics. If we are correct in these assumptions, then we would expect a reduced income statement impact from mortgage repurchases in 2011 versus what we experienced in 2010. ", "Now before covering the final part of this slide, let me discuss our non-agency exposure. As we indicated last quarter, we have about $17 billion in unpaid principal balances on non-agency loans that we originated in 2005 through 2007 and subsequently sold or securitized. As you can see on the slide, we have a modest amount of pending demand on the non-agency products, and we've also been receiving a small amount of repurchase request volume of about $10 million to $15 million in recent quarters. As such, while our losses have not been material, this experience has been factored into our mortgage repurchase reserve process.", "Let me finish up on this slide with a quick explanation of the bottom right box. There's been a lot of talk in the industry recently about lifetime loss estimates. The information presented here may be useful to you in deriving your own estimates for our lifetime losses, as well as our remaining exposure. You can see that we have $114 billion in remaining UPB on loans that we sold between 2005 and 2010. The $17 billion in non-agency loans is included within that figure. You also see depicted on the slide that to date, we have recognized approximately a $1 billion in losses through the income statement, which includes more than $700 million in charge-offs and the current $265 million in reserves for future losses.", "With that background, let's shift gears and go to Slide 14 for a review of expenses. Noninterest expense was up 3% when compared to the third quarter and 7% versus the prior year. Adjusting for losses on debt extinguishment and write-downs in our affordable housing unit, both of which we've listed in the appendix, the growth rates are 3% and 8%, respectively. The increased expenses in both periods are due to the three drivers that you see at the bottom of the page: employee compensation, outside processing and software and marketing. ", "Focusing on the sequential quarter, our adjusted noninterest expense was up $46 million in total, and the increase in these three highlighted drivers was $59 million. Now broadly speaking, the increases relate to investments that we've made to drive our business, but I'll provide some additional detail here. ", "Employee compensation and benefits was up $29 million due to higher salaries and increased incentive compensation. Salary increases were largely the result of hiring within our technology, mortgage and client support areas. The incentive compensation increase was driven by the strong full year performance within certain business lines. Outside processing and software increased $17 million due to client acquisition and risk management technology projects, as well as higher transaction volumes. And the marketing and customer development increase of $13 million was due to overt investments to grow our business, and we have been very pleased with the results to date.", "In the appendix, you will also see detail of our credit-related noninterest expenses, which also increased $9 million in the quarter, driven by $13 million in additional other real estate expenses. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we are seeking to balance investments in the business with our expense discipline. Our full year expense growth is reflective of that balance. When you exclude non-core items like the 2009 goodwill impairment, our adjusted noninterest expenses increased about 3% over 2009, whereas revenue grew approximately 5%. And looking to the first quarter of 2011, we do expect an increase in personnel expenses due to the seasonal increase in employee benefits costs. However, we expect declines in other line items to offset this impact, such that total noninterest expenses will be flat to down in the quarter. ", "And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom Freeman to discuss asset quality.", "Thomas Freeman", "Thank you, Mark. I'll begin today's review of our asset quality on Slide 15. As you heard from Mark and Jim, the overall theme of our credit message this morning is that asset quality continued to improve during the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs, provision expense, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all decreased. In fact, as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, every key credit quality metric on the slide improved for the second quarter in a row. Net charge-offs declined 10% from the third quarter to $621 million, and the corresponding annualized charge-off rate declined to 2.14%. Provision expense declined primarily as a result of lower charge-offs, driven by improving credit quality. As a result of current quarter asset quality trends and an outlook for continued improvement, the allowance for loan losses was reduced by a $112 million. This compares to a $70 million reduction in reserves in the third quarter.", "The allowance-to-loan ratio ended the quarter at a healthy 2.58% of loans. Loan loss reserves declined on both an absolute and a relative basis for three reasons: First, as Mark noted earlier, high-risk portfolio balances continued to decline; second, charge-offs associated with some of these higher risk portfolios, such as construction, absorbed some of the reserves; third, emerging risk moderated.", "The loan production that replaced this run-off and is generating net portfolio growth is higher-quality commercial and consumer loans and federally guaranteed student mortgage loans. Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets declined during the quarter by $263 million and $300 million, respectively or by 6%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of declining nonperforming loans. ", "Ongoing resolution of problem assets continued to drive declines in nonperforming loans. In addition, owned real estate assets are moderating as we continue to aggressively dispose of properties once we have clear title. As a result, owned real estate plus other repossessed assets has remained consistently low as a percentage of declining NPAs. A key leading indicator of asset quality, particularly for consumer loans, is 30-to-89-day delinquencies. These early-stage delinquencies declined again during the quarter to 90 basis points after excluding government-guaranteed student loans and voluntary Ginnie Mae mortgage purchases. This leading indicator of future asset quality has fallen significantly since the beginning of 2009. During this time, the economy and employment conditions have improved somewhat, but remained sluggish overall. As a result, we don't expect significant further improvement in early-stage delinquencies until economic conditions improve.", "Please turn to Slide 16 for a review of asset quality by product. This slide provides net charge-off and early-stage delinquency metrics by loan type. It illustrates at a more granular level where overall asset quality has improved and that asset quality issues remained concentrated in the Residential Real Estate and Construction portfolios. More specific takeaways from this slide are that while total portfolio balances increased over $900 million, the higher risk Residential and Construction portfolios declined by nearly $1.3 billion. ", "Charge-offs remained stable in most portfolios, declined meaningfully in Mortgage and Construction and increased modestly in Commercial. Overall, early-stage delinquency was broadly stable to down among the portfolios. ", "Now let's focus on the individual portfolios beginning with Commercial. This portfolio continues to perform well. Balances grew. Net charge-offs increased somewhat, and early-stage delinquencies remained very low. We do not believe that the $29 million increase in commercial charge-offs is indicative of a trend, and it was accompanied by a 20% increase in commercial nonaccrual loans.", "Charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate portfolio were stable compared to last quarter's 1% of loans on an annualized basis. Early-stage delinquency declined significantly, and the level of nonaccrual loans increased somewhat. The current commercial real estate correction continues, and we expect some variability in the performance as this cycle plays out.", "However, as I've said many times during these calls, we continue to believe this portfolio will perform comparatively well, given its composition. To date, our performance expectations have been met. On an absolute basis, the bulk of our charge-offs continue to come from Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios. Combined, these three portfolio produced slightly over 70% of our fourth quarter net losses. However, these portfolios are also driving the sequential quarterly improvement in net charge-offs. ", "Net losses in these portfolios declined nearly $100 million compared to last quarter, with the majority of the improvement coming from residential mortgages. Quarterly variability in construction losses is to be expected as we continue to work through the remaining risk in this run-off portfolio. Charge-off trends in Consumer, Mortgage and Home Equity tend to be less variable from quarter-to-quarter and are the product of declining delinquencies and stabilizing home values. ", "Asset quality in the Consumer portfolios was basically stable. Charge-off ratios in the Direct and the Indirect portfolios remained roughly 60 basis points on an annualized basis and declined to less than 6% in our small credit card book. Early-stage delinquencies were flat compared to last quarter in all but the Student Loan portfolio. While delinquencies in the student loan portion of the Direct portfolio increased to 8.3%, this portfolio consists predominantly of lower-risk, government-guaranteed loans, which is evident in the charge-off ratio of less than 50 basis points.", "Next, I'm going to briefly talk about the higher-risk Residential Mortgage, Home Equity and Construction portfolios, which are detailed on the next few slides. These portfolios have generally exhibited declining balances and stable-to-improving risk over the course of 2010, and their performance in the fourth quarter was no different. My comments are going to be brief because we have provided these detailed views in each quarter throughout the cycle and are fundamentally less to say at this point. I will take the opportunity, however, to point out some key changes over time. ", "Please turn to Slide 17 in our Residential Mortgage portfolio. Asset quality in the Residential Mortgage portfolio remained stable during the fourth quarter. As mentioned a moment ago, charge-offs declined meaningfully. On this slide, you can see that balances in nonperforming loans trended down within each of the Mortgage portfolios, most notably within the higher-risk segments. Early-stage delinquencies increased marginally, and we believe seasonally, in most Mortgage portfolio segments.", "Our outlook for the Residential Mortgage portfolio remains consistent with the view we expressed last quarter. Past delinquency trends suggest reduced frequency of default over the next couple of quarters. We expect home prices to remain soft overall, trending down in some markets and stable-to-modestly up in others. We believe that lower expected default frequency and moderating loss severity will produce stable-to-declining nonperforming loan and charge-off levels over the near term.", "While [ph] this perspective be on the next quarter or two, it is important to note that the material improvement in the risk profile of this portfolio over the last three years. The total portfolio has declined $1.2 billion or less than 4% over the last three years. However, the highest risk elements in the portfolio, Alt-A seconds through prime seconds on the slide, have been managed down by over $5 billion or 50% since the end of 2007. Net growth in the core portfolio of $3.6 billion during this time has been in the form of mortgages guaranteed by the federal government.", "At year-end 2010, $3.8 billion or nearly 15% of the core Mortgage portfolio was backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae and the FHA. Including voluntary Ginnie Mae mortgage repurchases, federally guaranteed mortgages totaled $4.5 billion. ", "Moving to Slide 18 in home equity lines of credit. The Home Equity portfolio asset quality was basically stable, while higher-risk balances continued to decline. Charge-offs increased by $4 million and the net charge-off ratio rose modestly to 3.39%. Roughly half of the increase in the ratio was driven by higher net charge-offs, while the other half was attributable to lower portfolio balances. Declines in early-stage delinquency were concentrated in the higher-risk portfolios.", "Balances in this portfolio have declined roughly 9% over the last two years and are flat compared to three years ago. Run-off has been concentrated in the higher-risk portfolios where no new production has occurred and little or no line availability exists. ", "Now if you will turn to Slide 19, I will talk about our Construction portfolio. We continue to aggressively reduce exposure to higher-risk construction loan [ph], with balances dropping another 13% during the fourth quarter. Charge-offs declined sequentially for the second quarter in a row. However, charge-offs are expected to remain elevated and uneven as we work through the remainder of the risk in this portfolio.", "As you can see on the slide, residential-related construction has been the most problematic, with 80% of the nonperforming loan comprised of construction-to-perm, residential construction and land loans. Overall, nonperforming construction loans decreased for the third straight quarter. While there may be some variability, we generally expect this trend of declining nonperforming loans to continue as we aggressively pursue workouts and transition foreclosed assets to other real estate owned and ultimately disposition.", "The Construction portfolio also warrants a little historic perspective. Balances of $3.8 billion are down nearly $10 billion or 72% since the end of 2007. This reduction in outstanding balances was accomplished with $1.1 billion of cumulative charge-offs over the three-year period. With 29% of the remaining portfolio in nonperforming status and appropriately reserved, we believe we are well positioned to manage the remaining risk in this portfolio.", "Next I'm going to review the portfolio of restructured loans in Slide 20 of today's presentation. The vast majority of SunTrust restructured loans continue to be loans that were modified to assist individual consumers experiencing financial difficulty. 97% of our accruing loan modifications benefit customers by reducing interest rates and exempting terms on mortgage and consumer loans. The payment performance of these accruing restructured loans continues to be good, with 86% current on principal and interest savings.", "Accruing TDRs totaled just over $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up approximately $100 million from the third quarter. Growth in accruing TDRs slowed again in the current quarter as the volume of nearly delinquent loans eligible for restructure continue to decline. The balance of nonaccruing TDR remained basically unchanged compared to the third quarter. Two-thirds of the nonaccruing balances are restructured mortgage and consumer loans. The majority of SunTrust modifications on loans to business entities are classified as nonaccrual. At the end of the fourth quarter, roughly 1/3 of nonaccruing TDRs were loans to business clients. Of those, $213 million were loans to the commercial real estate line of business clients. ", "Before turning the call back to Kris, I'm going to provide a brief summary of today's asset quality review on Slide 21. Overall, improvement in asset quality continued in the fourth quarter. Improvements in asset quality metrics was broad-based. Provision expense charge-offs, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and early-stage delinquencies all declined.", "Individual portfolios showed generally stable-to-improving trends. Risk remains concentrated in the Residential Real Estate and Construction Portfolios. Balances and charge-offs in these higher-risk portfolios were stable to declining during the fourth quarter. Accruing TDRs are primarily related to mortgage and consumer loans. Solid payment performance continued, and the pace of new modifications has slowed. Our asset quality outlook for the first quarter of 2011 is for a modest decline in charge-offs and nonperforming loans as compared to the fourth quarter. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kris.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, Tom. Operator, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Chris Gamaitoni from Compass Point.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "Given home prices in Florida have generally fallen looking at -- Casular [ph] metrics or CoreLogic indices, and foreclosure timelines have extended, I was just wondering how you impact or how that impacted your allowance and fair value marks on OREO, as well as how that corresponds with your commentary that severity should be mitigating? I understand the default percentage mitigating, but how does severity to go down with those circumstances?", "James Wells", "I think what we're indicating is that the continued fall in housing prices has mitigated substantially. I mean, it's not falling by 10%, 12% a year. And in fact, it's falling in those areas of the Florida portfolio, basically in southern Florida where you're still seeing weakness in home prices. But the vast majority of the portfolio outside of Florida, northern Florida, Virginia and the rest of it, are showing more stability in housing prices and really flat-to-increasing values in those portfolios.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "And then on the non-agency side, for repurchase requests, I know it's not a big deal. I was just wondering generally where are those are coming from? Are those private wholesale investors? Or are those bond investors?", "Mark Chancy", "This is Mark Chancy. I'll take a stab at that, and then Bill Rogers may pile on. As we mentioned before we've got about $17 billion for the non-agency loans. Those were either sold into our own securitizations, which was about 15% to 20% of the total. And then the remainder were either whole loans and/or sold to third parties who then securitized the loans. So what I would say is that it's a mixture of those three different categories. It's a relatively small dollar amount, as we mentioned, of repurchase requests and pending demands. But I would say that we have received some from the various components that I just mentioned.", "William Rogers", "Nothing to add to that other than just it's a highly diversified portfolio, which is, we think, the strength of that non-agency exposure in addition to being small.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "And two quick questions. Just how much allowance do you have on the TDRs currently?", "Mark Chancy", "That's just not something that we have broken out in our disclosure. So I'll refrain from answering that question. We do have a very specific reserve process for the TDRs that we incorporate into our overall allowance framework. It's just not broken out separately.", "Christopher Gamaitoni ", "And then on a more broader kind of commentary, could you just talk about the competitive landscape in the Southeast market, especially now that Wells has fully integrated Wachovia and some of the larger multinational banks have talked about increasing competition there?", "William Rogers", "This is Bill Rogers. Let me start with a general comment that competition isn't new to the Southeast. I mean, this has been a highly competitive market for a very, very long time and continues to be a highly competitive market. We think we are extremely well positioned in our markets, enjoying market shares of second and third position in most of our markets. So it has been, is and will continue to be highly competitive.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Kristopher Dickson", "We're not showing any further questions at this time.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kris Dickson, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, Lindy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to SunTrust's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us today. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release presentation and detailed financial schedule are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Jim Wells; Bill Rogers; Mark Chancy and Tom Freeman. Jim will start the call with some opening remarks. Bill will then comment on TARP redemption and provide an overview of the quarter. Mark will discuss financial performance and review asset quality, and Bill will wrap up with operational highlights from our businesses. At the conclusion of the formal remarks, we'll open up the session for questions. ", "Before we get started, I need to remind you our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website. Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.", "James Wells", "Thanks, Kris. I think it's important to comment on the CEO leadership change that was announced this morning along with the earnings release. As you know, there is a tradition at SunTrust that CEOs retire by their 65th birthday, and for me, that's May 2011. As you also know, SunTrust and its board were on a robust succession management and development process, and that process has been in place and operative for some time for this particular succession. Bill Rogers is a deeply experienced banker and leader and has created great value for SunTrust over his long career. He's been the driving force behind our play to win growth and operating strategy that has helped drive the improvement in our performance in recent quarters. He has my respect as a leader and as a person, so not only due to the calendar, but also due to the fact that the financial services industry is now in the midst of a meaningful inflection point, we believe it's the appropriate time for this change. ", "This point in time is also a particularly good one for the invigorated leadership team we've assembled over the past several years to guide SunTrust through the difficult economic, regulatory and political environments. As those environments continue through a period of radical and uncertain change, Bill and the team are well-positioned to ensure that SunTrust will compete and will win. I'm very proud of what has been accomplished at SunTrust broadly and in recent years. And I'm also very proud of the leadership team that is now in place, and I'm confident of what I know they will achieve. With that, I'll turn it over to Bill.", "William Rogers", "Jim, thank you. As anyone would imagine, I feel very fortunate to be in the position I find myself in today. I joined this company almost 31 years ago as a management trainee. I've seen virtually every area of the company and worked with and for some great leaders. I'm very excited about the opportunity and what our company can do in the future. After all, we've got a great brand, the best footprint in banking, the best-in-class client service, positive momentum in key areas and teammates focused on winning. And as Jim said, our key senior leadership team has never been stronger or more focused.", "Now at the same time, I'm also very proud of how our company has responded to the adversity of the recent past, and particularly, Jim, under your leadership. Thank you for your support. Thank you for leading by example. The impact of your contributions to this company over 43 years will be felt for a very long time to come. I also appreciate the courage, patience and strength of character you've shown and at possibly no time greater than you demonstrated during what I'll refer to as the TARP era, and leading up to our recent repurchase of government shares. So thank you.", "Now before we get into the financial results, I'd like to spend a moment on Slide 3 discussing our redemption TARP shares, which occurred at the end of the quarter. In mid-March, upon the completion of the Federal Reserve's review of our capital plan, submitted in connection with the CCAR, we took actions to facilitate the redemption of TARP shares. ", "First, we conducted a successful $1 billion common stock offering. It was well received by the market, as evidenced by the pricing and oversubscription. Further, it had a follow to offer premium of 4.4%, which is a number that we were clearly quite pleased with. We followed that with $1 billion senior debt offering, which also went very well. It priced through our rating with attractive spread of just 160 basis points over the 5-year treasury yield. And on March 30, we redeemed the $4.85 billion of preferred shares that were issued to the U.S. Treasury under TARP. Our common stock issuance in connection with the redemption of those shares was just 21% of the total TARP outstanding, which we believe is well below the amount it would've been had we redeemed the shares earlier. By keeping shareholders' best interest in mind and demonstrating a patient, deliberate approach to TARP redemption, we successfully lessened the dilutive impact to our shareholders. And on balance, we're pleased with how this all concluded. ", "Now let's just take a look at Slide 4 at the impact this transaction and repayment had on our capital position.", "With the issuance of the common equity and the redemption of the TARP preferred securities, our capital position was significantly enhanced this quarter. The Tier 1 Common equity ratio increased 92 basis points to an estimated 9%. And the Tier 1 Capital ratio, excluding TARP, was up 98 basis points to an estimated 11%. Our capital position is well above current regulatory requirements, as well as the proposed Basel III regulatory standards. Now that TARP shares have been redeemed, I'll reiterate our future capital plans. As we've said, we have been investing and will continue to invest in our people and businesses to support future growth. At the same time, we also recognized the value of returning capital to shareholders, and that regard, in due time, we plan to increase the common dividend. We expect that our board will evaluate this decision in the latter part of this year, and if our financial results and the economy continue on a positive flight path, the board would be in a position to consider a modest increase.", "Now moving on to Slide 5. I'll provide review of our financial results. As you saw, we reported $0.08 per share or $0.22 when excluding the noncash charge from our TARP redemption. Further improvement in credit quality, expansion of the net interest margin and a reduction in expenses drove earnings that were even with the prior quarter when you exclude the TARP charge. As we emphasized profitable growth and credit quality continued to improve, we delivered solid performance that was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We also made additional progress in executing our strategies to drive longer-term growth. I'll spend a moment highlighting some of the key drivers this quarter, and then Mark will provide some more detail.", "Client deposit growth continued its positive trajectory, reaching a record high this quarter. A positive mix shift continued as well with lower cost deposit increases more than offsetting the decline in higher cost deposits. Overall, average loan balance increased only modestly. However, an important part of the story is the continued run-off on higher risk loans, which are down significantly this quarter. They were offset with increases in targeted, lower risk loan categories.", "We had another quarter of strong net interest margin growth. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter where we've seen expansion. The income declined as anticipated due to some seasonal aspects and lower refinance phase mortgage originations. The expense story is a good one compared with the prior quarter. Despite seasonally higher employee benefit expenses, we managed expenses down 5% from the prior quarter. And finally, improvements to credit quality continued as nonperforming loans and assets, early stage delinquencies, net charge-offs and the provision for loan losses all declined during the quarter.", "So we continue to navigate through a challenging operating environment. We're pleased with a solid first quarter performance and recent operating trends. Before I turn the call over to Mark, I'll conclude by noting that with the redemption of TARP shares behind us, we are singularly focused on our client centric strategies which are aimed at taking advantage of the growth opportunities in our market. We believe they'll be the catalyst for further improvement in profitability. We're continuing to invest in three main areas: teammate engagement, client loyalty and growth in primary relationships. And we believe this will drive market share growth and ultimately higher levels of profitability and improved financial performance for our shareholders.", "And Mark, I'll turn the call over to you and then I'll come back to wrap up.", "Mark Chancy", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 6. As Bill noted, we posted net income to common shareholders of $38 million or $0.08 per share for the quarter. These results included a $74 million or approximately $0.14 per share noncash charge in conjunction with TARP redemption, which relates to the write-off of the unamortized discount on the TARP preferred shares. Adjusted for this charge, EPS was $0.22, which was relatively stable compared to the $0.23 reported in the fourth quarter. ", "These results were driven by a lower loan loss provision and lower noninterest expenses in the quarter, offsetting a decline in fee income. All of which are consistent with the expectations that we outlined for you last month. Results in the current quarter compare very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and higher fee income. I'll provide additional detail on our performance on subsequent slides, so let's turn to Page 7 and begin with the review of our loan balances.", "Now before discussing the trends in the loan balances, I'll first orient you with our loan segments, which were introduced in our 10-K in conjunction with new accounting guidance for the industry around disclosures of loan portfolios credit quality. Loans are now reported in three segments: Commercial, Residential and Consumer, and the bar chart on this page reflects these categorizations. You'll also find more granular detail about our sub-portfolios, also called Classes, as you review the balance sheet tables contained within our press release.", "The classes in our largest segment, which is Commercial, include CNI, Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Construction. I will point out that Commercial Real Estate reflects the income producing loans, while the owner occupied loans are now included in the C&I class. The Residential segment includes mortgages, Home Equity products and residential construction. And Consumer includes the balance of our portfolio, the largest categories of which are guaranteed student loans and indirect lending.", "Now turning to the content on the slide. As you can see, average performing loan balances were up approximately $400 million compared to the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by growth in the Consumer segment, more than offsetting declines in commercial and residential. Consumer was up approximately $1.1 billion due to the full quarter effect of an auto loan portfolio purchase that occurred late in the fourth quarter, improvement in our own auto loan production and from higher government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment was down sequentially by about $350 million as we continued to manage down the commercial construction and commercial real estate classes. The decline was partially offset by an increase in C&I, included target areas for growth and asset based, middle market and SBA lending.", "With respect to commercial client utilization rates, we experienced a small increase in our diversified commercial line of business and our utilization within CIB, our corporate and Investment Bank, declined slightly and remained at a historically low level. Residential average balances declined during the quarter by approximately $550 million due to reductions in nonguaranteed mortgages, Home Equity and residential construction loans. Now relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up just over $2 billion or about 2%. The growth was within the Consumer segment, and, again, driven by indirect auto and government guaranteed student loans. The Commercial segment declines were due to Commercial construction and commercial real estate, while the residential portfolio stayed relatively flat as run-off in the high-risk segments of the portfolio was offset by an increase in government guaranteed loans.", "So there are two main takeaways that I'd like you to leave with from our loan discussion. The first is that while overall loan growth had been modest due to weak demand, we have made progress in our balance sheet diversification strategy. One aspect of that strategy is to grow the Consumer segment, and we increased balances there by about $4.5 billion from the prior year. Another component of the strategy is to grow targeted portions within the Commercial segment, and we're also making progress on this front. As a couple of examples, we originated $4.4 billion in new C&I loans and commitments this quarter, which is up by $1.3 billion from the same quarter last year. We also grew our asset-based lending balances by over $500 million relative to last year.", "In addition to growing these targeted areas, we've also been reducing our exposure to higher risk portions of the portfolio. This change in the risk profile of the loan book is the other key takeaway, which I'd like to discuss in greater detail on Slide 8.", "Loans that we deemed to be higher risk are displayed on this page and totaled $12 billion at the end of the first quarter. That's down by over $11 billion, or almost 50%, from the fourth quarter of 2008 and these higher risk categories now represent only 10% of our total loan portfolio. Furthermore, government guaranteed loans are up over $6 billion during this same time frame, and they now comprise $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher risk balances and the increase in guaranteed loans constitutes a significant derisking of the overall portfolio. And the risk reduction continued in the first quarter of 2011, as higher risk categories declined by $1.1 billion or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2010. The largest dollar declines came in the commercial construction and the Home Equity portfolios. So with that as background, let's turn to Slide 9 now for a discussion of deposits.", "Average client deposits were up $1 billion from the fourth quarter, and we continue to see the favorable shift in mix towards lower cost accounts. DDA, NOW, money market and savings increased by a combined $2.2 billion or 2%, while time deposits were managed down by $1.2 billion or almost 6%. Compared to the first quarter of last year, average client deposits were up about $5.6 billion or 5%. And the increase was also due to growth in the lower cost accounts, specifically DDA and money market, while higher cost time deposits declined. As we've acknowledged before, our favorable deposit trends have undoubtedly been aided by changes witnessed throughout the industry, such as clients' preferences for increased liquidity. But as Bill will share with you later, we are also confident that we are driving the trends via providing superior client service and through the investments that we've made. One financial metric where these efforts are evident is in our net interest margin, which you can see on Slide 10.", "Net interest income was down $17 million or 1% from the fourth quarter due primarily to the fact that there were two fewer days in Q1 versus Q4. However, the net interest margin was up 9 basis points to 353, marking its eighth consecutive quarter of expansion. The sequential quarter increase was driven by a combination of higher yields on earning assets, in part from the securities portfolio repositioning that we completed during the quarter, as well as from lower rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which was largely the result of the aforementioned deposit mixed shift.", "Relative to the prior year, net interest income increased by $75 million or 6% and the margin expanded 21 basis points. This improvement was primarily the result of the previously discussed deposit trends and our effective deposit pricing. Our loan pricing improvements and our commercial loans swap position have also helped mitigate the impacts of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2011, we do expect our net interest margin to be relatively stable to its current level.", "So let's switch our focus to noninterest income on Slide 11.", "On a reported basis, noninterest income was down 14% sequentially, but, as in prior quarters, we've made adjustments for certain items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the full list of these adjustments may be found in the appendix. Net of these adjustments, noninterest income this quarter was $825 million, which was down 11% from the prior quarter. This reduction was in line with our expectations and primarily driven by lower mortgage production and Investment Banking income. Trading account profits and commissions were also one of the larger drivers on a reported basis. However, this line item was stable when factoring in the adjustment items.", "Sequential quarter mortgage production decline was due to the impacts of higher mortgage interest rates during the quarter. As a result of the higher rates, we experienced a 34% reduction in closed loan volume, as well as lower production margins. Investment Banking declined from its record fourth quarter level, primarily due to lower syndication revenue as numerous clients accelerated closings of transactions into the fourth quarter of 2010. Relative to the prior year, adjusted fee income increased by $53 million or 7% despite lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. The growth came from a broad array of core consumer and commercial key categories, including trust income, retail investment services, Investment Banking and card fees, each growing by more than $10 million and by double-digit percentages.", "Now let's turn to Slide 12 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. As you can see in the top left portion of this slide, the income statement impact from repurchase costs was $80 million during the current quarter. This was down slightly from the prior quarter as charge-offs declined $15 million to $75 million. The reserve was increased $5 million to $270 million, as we did see an uptick in repurchase demands during the latter part of the quarter. The top right portion of the slide shows that pending demands increased to $363 million, and this was caused by increased repurchase requests, which are depicted in the bottom left of the slide. ", "This quarter, we had $313 million in repurchase requests, which was an increase of $80 million from the fourth quarter and driven primarily by increased agency requests related to the 2007 vintage loans. As the quarterly trends depict, repurchase requests can be very lumpy from one period to another, and while we continue to expect some volatility in these requests, we also continue to believe that over time, normal seasoning patterns will result in a decline in volume in the higher loss 2006 to 2007 vintages.", "The information that we have provided in the bottom right of this slide is consistent with what we shared last quarter and is intended to provide you useful information with respect to calculating a lifetime loss estimate, as well as some additional detail around our non-agency exposure.", "Now unrelated to the repurchase reserve, but another mortgage topic that has gotten a lot of attention recently, is the impact that the April 13th mortgage servicing consent order could have on the value of mortgage servicing rights. In short, our MSR value of $1.5 billion was evaluated in the context of the overall servicing market at the end of the first quarter and does not explicitly include any incremental cost that may be associated with the order. However, we did assume in our valuation methodology that the elevated level of mortgage servicing costs that we are currently experiencing remains high for a considerable period of time into the future. We are in the process of evaluating whether there could be additional costs associated with the consent order that warrant inclusion in our valuation approach but it's too early to know what this impact might be. In the interim, as you are developing your own estimations, it is important to remember that servicing portfolios can vary significantly across servicers due to differences in product mix, delinquency status and service fee levels, all of which can create valuation differences across institutions.", "Now let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of expenses. On a sequential quarter basis, reported noninterest expense declined $83 million or 5%, while adjusted noninterest expense was down $67 million or 4%. These declines came despite higher seasonal employee benefits costs experienced during the first quarter and were driven by three areas: credit related, marketing and outside processing expenses. Credit-related costs were down $34 million due to lower other real estate expenses, as well as decreases in credit and collections expenses. Marketing and outside processing were down $18 million and $16 million, respectively, as both of these categories had specific investment related expenses that were incurred during the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter of 2010, expenses increased by a little over $100 million. Staff expenses were the largest driver, up $62 million due to higher compensation from improved revenue generation, as well as the hiring of additional teammates, primarily in mortgage origination and in client service and support roles.", "Let's now switch gears and turn to Slide 14 for a review of credit quality. Asset quality metrics continued a multi-quarter trend of improvement as early-stage delinquencies, nonperforming assets and net charge-offs all declined again. As a result, we lowered the allowance by $120 million or about 4% to its current level of 2.49%. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding the guaranteed portfolios, were 80 basis points this quarter, which was a 10 basis point improvement from the prior quarter and a little more than we expected. Improvement occurred in most of the portfolios and was most notable in a 27 basis point decline in the nonguaranteed residential mortgage portfolio. Among other large portfolios, commercial real estate and indirect auto both declined 10 basis points, while Home Equity notched up a little bit by 6 basis points.", "We continue to expect that additional improvement in early-stage delinquencies, particularly in our residential portfolios, will be tied to the health of the general economy since commercial and consumer delinquency rates of 24 and 79 basis points, respectively, are already at relatively low levels. We'll discuss nonperforming loans and net charge-offs in greater detail on the following page, so I'll keep my comments brief for now.", "Nonperforming loans were down $139 million, marking the 7th consecutive quarterly decline. Nonperforming assets declined by $190 million due to lower NPLs, as well as an approximate $50 million reduction in other assets. Net charge-offs also continued their favorable trend, down $50 million in the quarter to an annualized 2.01% of average loans. Now the decline in the allowance for loan and lease losses was consistent with the reduction in the fourth quarter, and it was also commensurate with the improved credit quality of the portfolio, including a reduction in higher risk balances, as we discussed earlier, lower emerging risks in the portfolio as evidenced by the lower delinquency rate and the recognition of current-quarter charge-offs.", "So let's turn to Slide 15 for a review of credit trends by loan segment, and you may also find  additional detail by loan and class in the appendix. Nonperforming loans were down 3% from the prior quarter, driven by residential, and, specifically, the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. Included in this nonperforming loan decrease was a transfer of $57 million in carrying value to loans held for sale. The value of these loans was reduced to $47 million in connection with the transfer, and a $10 million differential was recognized in the current quarter as a net charge-off.", "Commercial Loans continued to perform well and had relatively stable nonperforming loans, as a $118 million sequential decline in commercial construction was partially offset by a $93 million increase in commercial real estate. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or 23%, driven by nonguaranteed mortgages, construction and C&I. Net charge-offs, which are depicted at the bottom of the page, were down 8% from the prior quarter, driven by lower losses in the Commercial segment, and, specifically, within the C&I and commercial real estate portfolios. The Residential and Consumer segments were relatively stable.", "Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs declined across most portfolios and were down by a total of $250 million or 30%. And the largest reduction occurred within the nonguaranteed mortgage portfolio. And as we look to the second quarter of 2011, based on the continued progress that we've made in early stage delinquencies, we currently expect nonperforming loans to decline and net charge-offs to be relatively stable to first quarter levels. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to discuss some recent business highlights.", "William Rogers", "Okay. Thanks, Mark. And before we open the call up for Q&A, I'm going to spend a few minutes highlighting a selection of recent accomplishments. I want to share with you how we're aligning the company to deliver improved performance, as well as some of the progress that we've made today.", "Now as you'll recall from a number of our prior presentations, our three guiding principles for operating and growing our company are centered around one team, client first and focus on profitable growth. It's a pretty simple formula, but its results are powerful when executed correctly. One team can be exemplified by engaged teammates who are more passionate about their jobs. They understand the company's mission and their role in its application, and they provide better service to their clients. Well-served clients are more loyal, they're less likely to attrite and they offer a greater a share of their wallet, and, finally, they are a great source of referrals. And when all that occurs, we make more money for our shareholders.", "By focusing on these three core tenets, we're confident we can markedly move the needle on core performance. And today we've chosen to highlight a few key accomplishments in each of those areas.", "First and, we believe, foundational to our success in the other two areas, is our ability to work as one team. And we measure this very intently, and we're realizing positive improvements in virtually every area. We're listening to our teammates, and we're making the necessary changes to improve the experience of working for SunTrust. An engaged teammate, we believe, is a competitive advantage. One team also means working to ensure the entire bank has delivered to our clients seamlessly. Our improved cross-selling efforts and client penetration are testaments to our progress here. ", "One example is in our ability to cross-sell mortgages to our banking clients. Currently, 1 in 5 of our input, print homeowner households have a mortgage with SunTrust, and we believe that's a high number. Our strategy is one that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients. That's what we mean by client first, and, like teammate engagement, it's something that we measure intently. In fact, we call 1,000 clients a day and ask them how we're doing. And overall, they tell us we're doing pretty well. This is also clear from the recognition we've received for both consumer and commercial banking client experience. For example, we recently received 18 Greenwich Excellence Awards for our distinguished performance in delivering for our business clients. This is up substantially from prior years, and we were one of the top award recipients nationally. We were the only bank to earn 18 Greenwich Awards and the JD Power Customer Satisfaction Award in Business Banking in the same year, and we recently received the #1 ranking for customer experience from Forrester Research.", "These awards and our own internal measures support our belief that we offer our clients a differentiated, high-quality banking relationship. I believe this supports Mark's statement that our client service is helping drive increased deposit balances.", "Our client service levels are also driving client loyalty. Our client satisfaction is at the highest level it's ever been as measured by our own service excellence program. And this is evident in our numbers, as net new consumer checking accounts were up 30% this quarter from the same quarter last year. What's also important to note that this increase was driven by a 9% decline in closed accounts as our attrition rates continue to improve. ", "So you've seen improved performance over the past several quarters, and we believe even better days are ahead of us. A few highlights from this quarter on areas where we've succeeded include: industry-leading client deposit growth, the third-best net income and revenue quarter in  Corporate Investment Banking, revenue up nearly 50% over the prior year, substantial increase in Wealth and Investment Management net income up 34% from the prior year, with a 16% in net fee income; overall we're pleased with the progress we've made thus far, but there's some obviously more ground to cover.", "So moving onto the final page, I'll wrap up with some formal comments for this call. Let me give a brief summary of what we shared with you today. We redeemed our TARP shares via a patient approach and are well-positioned from a capital perspective to pursue our growth objectives. The emphasis on profitable growth that I just outlined, coupled with continued credit quality improvement, asset and liability pricing discipline all resulted in solid performance this quarter, and that's despite some cyclical and industry headwinds. And our investments are paying off with some favorable trends in our core businesses. Now with that said, Kris, I'll turn it back over to you.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, Bill. Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to ask the participants to please limit themselves to 1 primary question and 1 follow-up.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Pancari from Evercore Partners.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.", "You talked about your, the servicing, the MSR valuation, you mentioned that your assumption that costs related to servicing remain elevated -- are your assumptions for the MSR. So can you give us any help in trying to quantify what you mean by elevated and how the current assumption compares to the costs previously?", "William Rogers", "John, it's Bill. Let me just start with the presumption, and you've seen in our numbers, and we've been investing steadily in both people and technology related to the mortgage challenges for the past two years. So while we might see some modest increase in expenses from the consent order, I mean, I think we're still evaluating that full impact, and I think the cost of what we've been doing is included in that analysis. And you also have to consider the composition and performance of our portfolio and how it might differentiate from others. Did I get at it?", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Yes, you did; that's helpful. The third-party review of your foreclosures process as required under the consent order, has that begun yet?", "Thomas Freeman", "If you go over the order there -- it's Tom Freeman. Yes, it has begun. We have people in place. The evaluation is to go over right now how it's going to be conducted to make sure it's going to be done in conformance with what the authorities are looking for, but it's underway.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the loan pricing that you're seeing in Commercial? I've noticed that not only have you had pretty good growth but the yields are holding up. So I'm wondering both what kind of pricing are you getting and then what kind of impact from swaps might be in that average yield?", "William Rogers", "Okay. Matt, I'll take the first part of that; maybe I'll switch it to Mark to take the second part of that. We've had an intense focus, as you well know, on both the asset and liability pricing. We've put a great deal of discipline into the system, and we have been pleased that we've held up. I mean, we looked intently at how we're doing, not only relative to last quarter, but also relative to industry benchmarks. All that being said, and we're pleased with where we are, that's not to dismiss that there's a lot of price competition out there right now, and it's intense, and we're all focused on adding assets to the balance sheet. So while we've held up, we're in a pretty good headwind on pricing spread. And Mark, I'll turn it over to you if you want to talk about the swap.", "Mark Chancy", "Yes. Matt, we've had a good benefit, as you know, over the last several quarters from the Commercial Loans swaps. They still have about three years duration left, and the quarterly benefit is around $150 million. So I think as we move forward, you'll have a view on interest rates, if rates continue to stay low on the short end of the curve, we will continue to get a benefit for a period of time. That's certainly benefiting our overall commercial yields. We also did some securities portfolio repositioning in connection with the TARP repayment process during the quarter that also augmented our earning asset yields in the quarter.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then Mark, just a follow-up question on the liability side. You've obviously have had this good remixing of your funding base, growing deposits, running off some of the long-term debt. Outside the debt issuance to repay TARP, do you think you can work down the long-term debt further from here?", "Mark Chancy", "Yes, we have made a lot of steps here in the last couple of years in reducing our long-term debt, and it benefited dramatically, frankly, from the strong growth and improvement in market share in the deposits. We do have some additional room to go in terms of the liability management. There are also the trust preferreds that we will be evaluating as we move forward during the course of the year, depending upon the final capital rules that are proposed by the Federal Reserve, and so that's another area that we will be evaluating during 2011.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And I'm probably trying to squeeze in a third question, but it's a little bit related. I guess some banks swap out their long-term debt. It seems like you've chosen to put it more on the asset side because it doesn't look like you've swapped out the long-term debt. Is that -- is there a lot...", "William Rogers", "Let me say it this way, Matt: As of the end of the quarter, that's correct. We issued on a fixed rate basis. We will evaluate in the context of our overall balance sheet management and our asset liability management strategy whether or not to swap that issuance to floating rate and/or other similar actions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just a question on the credit side. Mark and Tom, you've been talking now for several quarters about, just as we think about the outlook for charge-offs, more flattish, if you will, in Q2. But the question relates to, with $120 million in basically reserve release this quarter, the commercial past dues are basically half of what they were a year ago. The mortgage side is becoming more stable. So how should we kind of think about -- two parts: One, your assumption in terms of the ongoing kind of loss severity and your assumptions built into the reserves there on the mortgage side; and just ongoing reserve release given kind of the stabilization that we're now starting to see in the mortgage and kind of that flat outlook for charge-offs.", "Thomas Freeman", "It's Tom. The indication -- I think of what's going on, I think you have to go back and go back through the chain again, and the chain starts with early stage delinquencies continuing to come down within early stage delinquencies coming down with the lag effect. I think that, that has implications for charge-offs later in the year and early next year in terms of a continued improvement in charge-off activity. And I think we're going to continue to work through, although it's hard work working through getting down our nonperforming loans. I think we're seeing a recurring downward trend in those activities as asset quality continues to improve, our need for reserves mitigates.", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "So if I hear you're right, there may be still more release to come on the reserve side, perhaps more so on as it ties to commercial. But we may not see a more tangible benefit until maybe later in the year or early next year, just based on where the delinquencies are trending?", "Mark Chancy", "This is Mark Chancy. We're at about a 2.5% reserve ratio versus about a 2% charge-off ratio in Q1. We had a pretty nice takedown, 8% sequential decline in net charge-offs, as you saw, and that was certainly a rationale for us, along with the delinquencies as Tom mentioned and the reduction in nonperforming loans. You'll see a reduction of about a similar magnitude that you've seen in the last couple of quarters in terms of the reserve. We're not providing any specific forward-looking guidance, but we are guiding you down on non-performers and relatively stable net charge-offs, at least in the second quarter, as we continue to have some higher levels of commercial real estate, which we have guided you to in the past couple of quarters. And as Tom mentioned, we see the further improvement in charge-offs in the consumer portfolio that correlates to the delinquency trends.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Sticking with the nonperforming asset questions, do you guys have the inflow number that you report on your line 9? If you look at it, the last three quarters, the inflows of new nonaccruals have been running at about $1.2 billion. And tied to that, did your classified loans decline this quarter relative to the fourth quarter of last year?", "Thomas Freeman", "Oh, classifieds came down nicely during the quarter, and we're continuing to see a path of slowing inflows in almost all of the loan categories into nonperformance.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "On the classified decline, was that 5%, 10%?", "Thomas Freeman", "I'm trying to think how to answer that. Classified declined; we don't report separately, I think.", "James Wells", "Yes. Gerard, that'll come out... [indiscernible]", "Thomas Freeman", "It'll come out more of queue 9, right now, if you could wait a couple of -- a few days.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay. And then on the net interest margin, if you assume that the fed funds rate stays around 25 basis points through the year-end and the yield curve is essentially where we are today, what would be the main driver of keeping it where it is? Will it be more the management using different derivatives or is it going to come from better loan growth, what should we focus on to see what this net interest margin could look like over the next nine months, assuming rates stay low and loan demand doesn't pick up dramatically?", "William Rogers", "As I mentioned earlier, we've been getting a significant amount of improvement in the margin that's come from the deposit mix that continues to be favorable in terms of growth at the low-cost accounts like DDA and money market. That's been a real driver for us in the past year, particularly when you look year-over-year, where those lower costs deposit categories have grown double digits while time deposits have shrunk. And the repayment of the debt, as we talked about a few minutes ago. We have some additional liability management strategies that we can employ that will continue to support and/or augment the margin. But one of the things that we've said consistently in the past year is, as the economy improves, we are expecting commercial deposits to decline somewhat as loan growth accelerates. So far, that hasn't happened at the pace because the economic environment hasn't picked up to the level that we had all hoped. And so at this point, we're continuing to benefit significantly from the higher level of deposits. As the curve has steepened, so new CDs become a little bit more expensive and so we're going to evaluate that in the context of the continued growth strategy that we have in growing core households. So all that mixed together, we've given you guidance that we think is relatively stable in the near-term.", "James Wells", "Yes, and I'll just add onto that, we're continuing to maybe surprise ourselves by the ability on the liability side to continue to wring a couple of basis points with a variety of different strategies, as Mark elaborated. And then we'll have to see on what happens on the asset growth side. I mean, I think we've got some good signs in a couple of key areas related to asset growth, but that'll clearly be dependent upon some continued and improved economic recovery during the latter part of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I wanted to ask you about the restructuring. We moved a little more than $5 billion of treasuries over to agencies. What was the pickup in yield, and what kind of duration did you put that into?", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, this is Aleem Gillani, the treasurer. We picked up about 30 basis points in excess yield on those, and we put those -- we put the new funds into a mix of agency bullets and into MBS. Average duration of the new funds would be on the order of about 4 years.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "And was that pretty consistent with the treasuries that you were coming out of? So did you shift any of your positioning at all?", "Aleem Gillani", "The last set of treasuries that we were in just before we sold them off in order to repay the TARP were 5-year treasuries.", "William Rogers", "Yes, our overall buck [ph] securities portfolio duration is still around low 3, 3.3 years. But not a significant shift. We do have a view that interest rates on the short end are going to continue to stay relatively low through the end of the year given the continued weakness, particularly in the housing markets. And we have the balance sheet postured with that view in mind.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Okay. And excess cash on the balance sheet seems to be or may be around $2 billion. Is that a decent approximation?", "Mark Chancy", "A little higher than that, it's in terms of the amount at quarter end. We've been fluctuating in and out of basically $2 billion to $4 billion of excess cash.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just to extend on Gerard's question. Mark, to your point about currently getting a nice benefit in the NIM from the swap position, and that would continue as long as rates remain low, can you just walk us through and remind us what happens when rates start to move higher? Do you expect you can keep the margin just kind of flattened as those two things trade off? Higher rates, but then the swap income comes down?", "Mark Chancy", "Yes, let me just comment. When we do our asset and liability simulation analysis, we are basically neutral to a rising rate scenario, whether you shock it and/or you do a gradual ramp of rates. And so what I was trying to say is, as it relates to the commercial loan swap position, if rates continue to stay low, we get the full benefit of the differential between that received fixed payment and the floating payment that we made and we're getting a significant amount of net interest income coming off of those, that swap, which, the last number I have in my head is around $16 billion in aggregate notional. So on a go-forward basis, as rates rise, we are in a relatively neutral posture overall as a company.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, so the delta to rates would then really be just your ability to grow loans and keep deposit costs low?", "Mark Chancy", "Yes.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And my second question is just on the loan portfolio, I heard clearly where you're expecting to see growth over time, and I'm just wondering, as far as some of the portfolios that are just continuing to shrink or in kind of net runoff mode, at what points could you expect to see whether it's the CRE portfolio, the Home Equity portfolio, Commercial and Construction? Any signs that those portfolios get close to bottoming at some point this year, or is it just going to be a continuously kind of downward trail?", "James Wells", "I think, clearly, for this year, we're on a continual decline because, as you might imagine, there's not a lot of opportunity to replace those assets and we're on a $1 billion a quarter kind of trail from last quarter, and we don't have that kind of good asset opportunity in those categories.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then my last final follow up on that is just then, how are you approaching just the CRE market generally speaking from the terms of a capacity to look for opportunities when they come? And also, what pockets, if any, do you expect to see improvement? Are there any signals at all whatsoever?", "James Wells", "Yes, there are a few, and we're clearly being selective. We're working with long-standing clients. We look at our heat map, so to speak, of our franchise and where we see opportunities. And you, as you might imagine, multifamily would be one of those examples where you see some opportunities in select markets that will follow our clients. There are some industrial opportunity in some markets. Again, we'll follow our clients into well-structured deals. So selective, in the market with our clients around specific asset classes and specific markets.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Marinac with FIG partners.", "Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC", "I had a question on the mortgage prepurchases back on Slide 12. Is there any, I guess, background on the small increase we've seen from 2011 vintage?", "Mark Chancy", "2011 vintage? It's coming off of a very small base,  so when you look at it that way, there's nothing of any significance there, Chris.", "Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC", "Okay, very well. And just a question for Tom, is there anything geographically you're seeing on classifieds? Will they be following across the board by region as well?", "Thomas Freeman", "It goes into the spread of asset classes that we're in. The C&I stuff just continues to improve, I think across the board in all of our geographies. And the commercial real estate, because of our concentration in Florida, I think is most affected, both residentially and commercially, by continued weakness in the Florida market place.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Kevin Fitzsimmons with Sandler O'Neill.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill", "Bill, I was wondering if you could give us your sense on how you look at expansion through M&A? I know SunTrust has been through, is back to profitability now. You've paid back the TARP. I know there's a lot of work to do internally, and you often refer to the franchise strength. But just trying to gauge -- there's been a lot of discussion about consolidation in the space, at the same time, new organic growth just really doesn't seem to be that abundant. Is that something you have an appetite for, or below a certain size is it just not worth the effort, if you can just elaborate on that?", "William Rogers", "Yes, I think we've been sort of fairly consistent on that front. I mean, we've looked at opportunities. I mean, we're skilled in the process, and what you've seen from us in the past other than maybe a few small acquisitions in the Wealth and Investment Management area, we haven't found anything that was particularly attractive or accretive to the franchise. I think going forward, we would still be primarily an end-market type look and things that round out our franchise in areas where we have opportunity. But it would have to be geographically accretive to what we're trying to do and financially a smart deal. And in your question, I mean, some of the small things we've seen today just don't really fit into that category.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question today is from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "I want to ask you about the quarter-to-quarter movement and that mortgage production revenue line item, and particularly the game piece of it. It does seem like that  decrease was more than what we've seen from other banks. I'm just wondering if you can just talk about that quarter-to-quarter move and kind of what we can expect going forward or how we should think about it going forward.", "William Rogers", "Let me take a first shot at it. We were down 34% in closed loans, applications down about 16% and the gain on sale margin was tightened. I don't -- it would be confusing to me that we would be any particularly different from anybody else as it relates to that. Now all that being said, starting 18-months-plus ago, I mean, we're tight on credit, so we're maintaining to maybe in some quarter or not, maybe giving up a little market share to ensure that we've really got a tightness around the quality of the assets. On a go-forward basis, clearly, refinances is waning. It's about 40% of the volume in the quarter and has been going down pretty substantially. March was a little better month on the purchase side. We're starting to see some uptick in early application volume, and we'll have to see what happens on the purchase side going forward. I mean, it'll clearly be a purchase-driven market for the rest of this year.", "Mark Chancy", "And Jefferson, to your question also, you got to remember that the repurchase costs are a net against net production income, and we had about an $80 million addition to the reserve or impact to the income statement down from the last couple of quarters in that $85 million to $95 million range, but we've been hovering in that level. As that works itself through, that will be a reduction of a headwind, if you will, to net mortgage production income that we'll be able to post.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "And one follow up on the mortgage repurchase request. It would seem like that the requests are coming in sequentially, and we felt like they were getting closer to the end because we were doing more 2008, 2009 possibly requests. And what I hear you saying is that the '07 vintage requests have increased, is, was the feeling of sequentiality, if you will, incorrect, or do you think the sequential piece of it is out the window or is still kind of happening sequentially? Or just how should we think about the increase in the '07 vintage?", "Mark Chancy", "Yes, I mean, the bottom line is that we continue to have some variability on a quarter-over-quarter basis, particularly with one of the agencies as it relates to their processes and then what we should expect in terms of file requests, and ultimately, repurchase requests. I think what you can take from our reserving process is that while we did have a slight uptick in the reserve that correlated to the higher repurchase demands during the quarter, that at a high level, we are tracking, and based on the delinquency levels that we see and the expected burnout in some of those higher request vintages of '06 and '07, that we should continue to see improvement as we work ourselves throughout 2011 with repurchase requests. We made a statement earlier that we expected the net impact of the income statement to be down relative to 2010. And, but we're going to have some variability on a quarter-over-quarter basis.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Very good. Everybody, this concludes our call for the day.

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Kris Dickson, the Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to SunTrust's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us today.", "In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today.

Good morning, everybody, and glad to have you with us today. As you saw this morning, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $174 million or $0.33 per share. While the operating environment still has many uncertainties, we continue to show meaningful improvement in all aspects of our asset quality and improved performance in our business results. I'll spend a few moments providing a high-level overview of this quarter's results and a little more [ph] color, excuse me, later in the call. ", "Since the peak of nonperforming loans and charge-offs in 2009, our asset quality has demonstrated continued improvement. This quarter [indiscernible] as nonperforming loans and assets, early-stage delinquencies, net charge-offs and [indiscernible] declined again during the quarter. Deposit growth has also continued its multi [indiscernible]. Client deposits reached a new record high, and the favorable mix shift continued as lower cost deposit increases more than offset the decline in higher cost deposits. Aleem, let me turn it over to you.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning. I'll begin my comments today with a high-level review of the income statement on Slide 4.", "Net income available to common shareholders for the quarter was $174 million or $0.33 per share. This compares favorably to the first quarter reported EPS of $0.08 or $0.22 when adjusted for the noncash charge associated with TARP redemption. The primary drivers of the sequential EPS growth were a lower provision due to continued improvements in credit quality, higher fee income across multiple categories and lower preferred dividends due to TARP redemption, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses. ", "These results also compare very favorably to the prior year, driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and lower preferred dividends. I'll share additional color on our performance in a moment, so let's turn to Page 5 for a review of the loan portfolio.", "Average performing loans were flat compared to first quarter levels of $111 billion. However, we continued to make progress in diversifying the loan portfolio as we drove growth in targeted commercial and consumer areas while further reducing our residential real estate exposure. We also continued to de-risk the portfolio, and I'll share more detail with you about that later. Growth this quarter within the commercial segment was driven by C&I loans, which increased by $1 billion or more than 2%. This growth came generally from larger corporate borrowers and was most pronounced within areas that we've been targeting for growth, such as asset-based lending, middle market and certain industry verticals within our Corporate and Investment Banking business.", "The consumer segment expanded modestly, driven by guaranteed student loans. Conversely, residential loans declined by about $650 million, a similar amount to last quarter, mostly due to lower non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity balances.", "Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by about $3 billion or almost 3%. This growth was driven by consumer loans, which were up about $4 billion, specifically in student loans and indirect. Residential balances were down marginally as non-guaranteed mortgages and home equity balances both declined by about $1 billion, which more than offset the growth in the guaranteed mortgage portfolio. The commercial segment also declined, primarily due to intentional reductions in commercial construction, as well as lower commercial real estate balances, which more than offset the C&I growth that we've experienced for the last several quarters.", "Overall, loan growth and loan demand remained weaker than we would like, but we are pleased with our progress in growing selected areas of the portfolio, while concurrently reducing risk. Further detail on this risk reduction is on Slide 6.", "This page provides a visual of the trends in loans that, for this purpose, we categorize as higher risk. These portfolios now total $11.4 billion and have been declining consistently and meaningfully, down over 50% since the end of 2008. Concurrent with these declining higher risk balances, we've also grown our government-guaranteed loan portfolio, which now totals over $9 billion or about 8% of our total portfolio. Taken together, the reduction in higher-risk balances, combined with growth in government-guaranteed loans, constitute a substantial improvement in our risk profile.", "During the second quarter, higher-risk balances declined by about $700 million or 6%, with roughly half of that coming from commercial construction. Relative to the prior year, balances are down about $3.8 billion or 25%, with significant declines in each of the categories you see on this slide. We expect declines in the higher-risk portfolios to continue in the future, although, given their smaller aggregate balance, the absolute dollar decline could moderate somewhat. As such, the runoff in these portfolios could be less of a headwind for total loan growth than it has been in prior periods.", "Turning to Slide 7 for a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up $1.2 billion from the first quarter, reaching a record level of $121.9 billion. The favorable shift in the deposit mix toward lower-cost accounts continued, most notably by a DDA growth of $1.6 billion or 5.5%. Higher-cost time deposits declined $300 million. And NOW accounts also decreased in part due to public fund migrations into DDA. Relative to the second quarter of 2010, average deposits were up $5.4 billion or 4.7%. This growth was entirely from lower-cost accounts, primarily DDA and Money Market, which increased by a combined $9.5 billion. This growth in lower cost accounts has enabled us to manage down our higher-cost time deposits, which decreased by $4.3 billion or 18% from the prior year.", "Slide 8 covers net interest income, which declined modestly from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due -- which has increased modestly, I'm sorry, from the first quarter of 2011, primarily due to day count. The net interest margin, after expanding for 8 consecutive quarters, stabilized at 3.53%. Interest-earning asset yields declined 5 basis points due to lower loan yields. This was offset by a 7-basis-point contraction in interest-bearing liability costs due to the favorable deposit mix shift, lower rates paid and a reduction in our long-term debt costs.", "Relative to last year, net interest income increased by $78 million or 6%. The net interest margin expanded by 20 basis points. Favorable deposit trends were the primary drivers as rates paid declined and lower-cost deposit accounts increased. The enhanced liquidity position also enabled an almost $3 billion or 17% reduction in our average long-term debt balances. As we look to the third quarter, while we see both headwinds and tailwinds to the margin, our current expectation is for a modest decline, due primarily to further decreases in interest-earning asset yields resulting from the low-rate environment.", "Let's turn to noninterest income. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market accounts. And we've included these details in the appendix. After adjustments, noninterest income increased $37 million or 5% sequentially. Most prominent was the $28 million increase in investment banking due to strong syndicated financial revenue and another really good quarter for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, our investment banking business. While the investment banking line item has and continued to experience volatility due to market factors, it's clear that the investments we've been making in our Corporate and Investment Banking businesses are paying off.", "Other notable sequential quarter increases in fee income included deposit service charges and card fees. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income was up $53 million or 7% despite the $38 million decline in deposit service charges due primarily to Reg E.", "We saw increases across a broad range of consumer and commercial categories, including growth of $11 million or 12% from higher debit interchange revenue and retail investment services growth of $11 million or 23%.", "Let's now turn to Slide 10 for a discussion of mortgage repurchase trends. This is the same information that we've shown you for the last few quarters, reordered just a little bit. The top left shows new repurchase demands, which were $348 million in the second quarter. That's up by $35 million from the prior quarter, $26 million of which was from the 2007 vintage. As you see at the bottom of that table, a very limited amount of the demands, only 5% this quarter, are non-agency related. As a result of the new demands, the pending population, which is shown at the top right part of the page, grew to $472 million. In light of this larger pending population, we've increased the mortgage repurchase reserves to $299 million, which is shown on the bottom left portion of the slide. You'll also see that the income statement impact this quarter grew to $90 million despite actual charge-offs declining to $61 million. While demands will likely continue to be volatile on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we continue to believe that demands from the higher-loss 2006 and 2007 vintages will decline as normal seasoning patterns occur.", "Let's now turn to Slide 11 for a review of expenses. Expenses were up $77 million on a sequential quarter basis. Credit-related expenses accounted for $37 million or about half of this increase due to legal and compliance-related accruals. We also saw a $10 million increase in the FDIC premium due to the new asset-based assessment methodology. So overall, I'd characterize the growth in expenses as primarily due to the credit and regulatory environment, but I'd also say that at roughly $1.5 billion a quarter, which is where we've been plus or minus, our expense base is too high for this environment. Bill will speak momentarily to our efficiency improvement focus.", "Compared to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense was up by about $100 million and you see the factors listed on this slide. Compensation was the highest driver due to improved revenue in certain businesses, as well as for additional teammates that we've hired, primarily in client-facing and loss-mitigation positions. Let's switch to Slide 12 for a review of credit quality.", "Our asset quality story is a good one again this quarter. We continued and, in some cases, accelerated the multi-quarter trend of improvement that we've seen in all of our primary metrics. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, improved to 73 basis points, down 7 basis points from the prior quarter. Delinquency declines were evident across most loan categories, notably an 18 basis point improvement in non-guaranteed mortgages following the 27 basis point improvement last quarter. Commercial and consumer loan delinquency rates of 22 and 66 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. As such, we believe that any future improvements in delinquencies will be driven by the residential segment and be influenced by the overall health of the economy.", "Nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets were down 9% and 10%, respectively, and we also saw a reduction in NPL inflows. Net charge-offs also showed notable improvements, declining from the first quarter by 12%, while the net charge-off ratio fell 25 basis points.", "In light of the improvement in credit quality and the continued reduction in our risk profile, the allowance for loan losses declined by 4% for the first quarter to $2.7 billion.", "Let's turn to Slide 13 for some additional detail on nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by loan segment. Like last quarter, we've also provided some supplemental information by loan class in the appendix. The $361 million sequential decline in nonperforming loans marked the eighth consecutive quarterly decline and was primarily due to our commercial segment, including a 25% reduction in commercial construction. Reductions in almost all other loan classes occurred as well. The $1.1 billion or 23% decline in nonperforming loans from 2010 was largely driven by commercial construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I.", "Net charge-offs are shown at the bottom of the page, and the $66 million sequential decline was driven by our residential segment, specifically by the non-guaranteed mortgage and home equity portfolios. The $217 million or 30% improvement in charge-offs from the prior year was widespread across loan categories, with the largest dollar declines coming from non-guaranteed mortgages, commercial construction and residential construction.", "Overall, we're pleased with the direction in which all of our credit metrics are moving. The early-stage delinquency data indicate we may expect these trends to continue. Therefore, as we look to the rest of this year, we expect NPLs to continue to decline. We also expect net charge-offs to continue to trend favorably over time, although given the significant second quarter decline, third quarter net charge-offs are likely to approximate those of the second quarter, plus or minus.", "I'll continue my comments by focusing on capital. Capital ratios continued their expansion this quarter and remained well above regulatory minimums and the proposed Basel III ratios. Tier 1 common grew by an estimated 15 basis points to 9.2%, while Tier 1 was up by an estimated 10 basis points to 11.1%. Tangible common equity ratio expanded to 7.96% and tangible book value per share increased to $24.57.", "I'll conclude by noting that in light of the improved earnings per share we have generated this year, as well as the momentum that we're demonstrating in several of our businesses, we intend to request a modest dividend increase from our Board of Directors during the second half of this year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.", "William Rogers", "Thanks, Aleem. Now I'll turn you to Slide 15, and as you'll remember, we're organized around a consumer and wholesale businesses and this outlines several of the accomplishments in both. I'm not going to detail all of them this morning, but I'll point to the fact that we continue to make progress as we pursue a strategy that's grounded in providing the best service to our clients, thereby fostering loyalty, which helps us in attracting, retaining and expanding relationships. ", "A few highlights from the quarter on these areas where we've succeeded include: Retail client loyalty, which continues to improve and is exceeding our internal benchmarks. The loan production in the consumer businesses, while still low, is up 14% over the same quarter in 2010. Corporate and Investment Banking experienced its second-highest quarter of revenue generation and its third highest quarter of net income. Diversified Commercial Banking net income is up over 40% year-to-date, with favorable trends in both client acquisition and attrition as compared to last year. So overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we've made, and I think more importantly, with the momentum we've established. Now as you're all aware, and in light of regulatory changes, banks are evaluating how they charge for their services. We have invested significantly in the science of understanding consumers' behaviors and needs and clearly, that has shown us that attitudes about money and banking are evolving. So in response, we have reviewed our consumer product offerings to ensure they remain relevant, competitive and profitable.", "This quarter we announced some key changes to our checking account portfolio. And as part of these changes, we've simplified our products suite. We've discontinued free checking and introduced products that respond to how clients use their bank, including our new core product, Everyday Checking. This is one of the means by which we're both responding to clients' needs and mitigating the impact from regulations that are impacting our revenue stream. I'll outline a few more monetarily. But now that we've had clarity on the Durbin amendment, let me first provide some transparency around our estimates to the run rate impact of that particular piece of legislation and its impact on fee income.", "Now based on our business mix, we estimate that Durbin will have a 50% annualized impact before any mitigating actions. So to give you some additional context, our year-to-date annual debit interchange revenue is approximately $370 million. And as you're aware, the final rules will not be implemented until the beginning of the fourth quarter, so we'll only experience a small percentage of this in calendar 2011.", "And we've been evaluating a variety of methods to mitigate both the impacts of Durbin and Reg E. And you will recall that we made no immediate changes to our products or fees in response to Reg E as we wanted to monitor both the competitive and regulatory dynamics. Now with some additional clarity on both fronts and with a lot of client insights, we've moved into implementation mode on certain mitigation efforts.", "Now for example, we recently eliminated our debit rewards program, and I told you about the current rollout of our new checking product set. We also have other value-added checking features that we plan to introduce later, which we believe will be beneficial to our clients, as well as enhance our deposit fee income. So collectively and over time, we currently estimate that the benefits from all these changes will enable us to recapture around 50% of the revenue lost from both Durbin and Reg E.", "Now I want to emphasize that we've been very deliberate in this process, and we've spent a lot of time garnering feedback from our clients. During the implementation of Reg E, we received accolades from our clients and within the industry in terms of client satisfaction and with our communication efforts. We needed to understand the final impacts of both Reg E and Durbin before we rolled out our new product set. In the last few months, I've been in virtually all 4 corners of our retail franchise, and I'm really pleased with our teammates' responsiveness. The early results are exceeding our expectations and producing more primary accounts and accounts with higher balances.", "Now let me turn to the last slide for closing remarks. Now overall, we had some encouraging signs during the quarter, growth in targeted loan categories, a continued favorable shift in the deposit mix, good growth in certain fee areas and continued encouraging asset quality trends. Now while our results aren't yet where we'd like them to be, progress is being made, momentum is building, and we have specific initiatives aimed at accelerating our performance in the future. Some of these efforts are designed to further improve our revenue generation, and we feel good about our prospects, particularly as the economy improves and provides a little bit of tailwind.", "Now we also recognize that expenses or the run rate is just simply too high for this new environment. As a result, we also have initiatives underway to lower our expense base with a targeted run rate reduction of $300 million by the end of 2013. Now similar to our successful E squared expense reduction initiatives a few years ago, there are multiple tactics involved that are structural and will accrue benefits over a period of time. And I'll just take a moment or 2 to give you a flavor of how we plan to do this.", "First, a key focus will be on implementing an aggressive approach to what's commonly referred to as shared services wherein we will centralize and eliminate redundancy of similar functions currently housed in multiple parts of the organization. This will allow us to more effectively balance costs, quality and service, so we can more efficiently meet the needs of our lines of business, geographies and support projects. We've identified enterprise-wide solutions in such disciplines as technology and operations, finance, procurement, marketing and human resources to maximize their impact and improve their efficiency. Further, our supplier management efforts will be intensified to yield greater cost savings, and plans to reduce paper usage both within the organization and our interaction with clients will be accelerated.", "And while we're not approaching this as a headcount reduction exercise per se, we will be providing these services with fewer people in the future. Our clients continue to demonstrate an increasing preference for more technology-driven, self-service channels such as a more robust ATM network and enhanced mobile banking platforms. This increase in convenience for clients also results in lower delivery costs and improved efficiency in the branch network. As all of these reductions are intended to produce permanent alterations to our expense base versus a quick fix, only a small portion will be realized in 2011, while we expect that we'll have approximately 80% of the expense savings in our run rate by the end of 2012, with the remainder occurring in 2013. ", "So to be clear, these expense reductions are above and beyond those that we expect to normalize as the environment improves. Credit-related noninterest expenses, for example, have been running about $700 million in annual clip or roughly 12% of our expense base. That's several multiples above where they were pre-cycle and a big drag on our efficiency ratio. Even if these expenses normalized to a level somewhat higher than they were pre-cycle, there are still several hundred million dollars in credit-related expenses that, over time, we expect to come out of our current expense run rate as the environment improves.", "Our individual efforts and an improving economy are ingredients to our overall effort to permanently reduce our normalized efficiency ratio to under 60%. Getting to that level will take some time, and the realization of it is in part dependent upon an improving economy, but I've outlined elements that we can impact regardless. And I can assure you they we will receive the requisite intensity. It's important to note our efforts will be focused on driving expense savings without compromising the high service levels that our clients have come to expect and we believe strategically differentiate us from our competitors.", "So put another way, we are approaching this as we approach all aspects of our business: with a focus on the guiding principles of our operating philosophy, putting the client first by viewing the relationship through the eyes of those who choose our services, building a [indiscernible] team and focusing on profitable growth by operating efficiently and investing prudently. This planned development has been a team effort, and I have great confidence and a strong belief in our franchise potential and ability to deliver. So Kris, let me turn it over to you, and we can start the Q&A.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, Bill. Wendy, we're ready to open up for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "I lost you a little bit in the expense targets. You threw out $300 million as well as $700 million of credit-related expenses. So is it $1 billion of annual expenses that come out between the cost-save program and credit normalizing, or is it some number in between?", "William Rogers", "Yes. Really, what I wanted to point out is a couple of things. So the $300 million is a specific initiative with the things that I identified. The credit-related expenses, we don't know -- don't know the timing. Normalized credit expenses were somewhere in the past around $200 million. Will it get that low again? I don't know, but I don't think they'll operate at the current $700 million.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Okay. So maybe we have $400 million to $500 million of credit-related expense reduction that will drop to the bottom line. And then on the $300 million, can you just clarify, is that a targeted $300 million reduction relative to the current level, or is that $300 million of expense saves, some of which will be offset by natural growth and reinvestment and things like that?", "William Rogers", "Think of this specific $300 million as a net run rate reduction by the end of 2013. I mean, I think that's sort of the easiest way to think about it. The other investments that we'll make in our business, which we'll continue to do, will be self-funded. So this is intended as sort of a permanent reduction of a run rate by end of 2013.", "Brian Foran", "And so a run [indiscernible] $0.5 [ph] billion we see today?", "William Rogers", "Yes. Think about a normal quarterly expense [indiscernible] billion [ph] and a half. Does that make sense?", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "That does make sense.", "William Rogers", "Thanks, Brian.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "I think you just answered this, but just putting all the numbers together, so you're at $6 billion run rate right now on the expense side. And as you think about the end of 2013, you take away the $300 million and then take away the estimate, that $400 million or $500 million of environmental costs, and your all-in expenses would be in the $5.5 billion range, plus or minus would be how to think about it?", "William Rogers", "Yes, I think if you assume that as sort of a run rate kind of basis, and that doesn't assume other investments that we might make relative to growth. But I think your math is right in terms of how you're thinking about it, and you need to make your own assumptions on the credit-related costs. So I think you got to put that in your model because I think we're all sort of -- speculating as to what the new normal might be as to credit run rate.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then of that $5.5 billion or so of expenses, that would be the base that you'd hope to get an efficiency ratio I think you said of 60% or the low 60s?", "William Rogers", "Yes, I think if you sort of do the math, think about our current non- and net-interest income, think about the expense base minus the $300 million, minus whatever you would assume for credit-related costs and then minus repurchase costs, mortgage repurchase costs, which we assume will get back to some sort of normalized level, and then you sort of crank that [indiscernible] you can sort of see a way to a below 60% efficiency ratio and an above 1x ROA.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, yes. Makes sense. And then separately, if you look at your tax rate this quarter, it was high versus last quarter, even though the pretax earnings was similar. You pointed to several specific discrete items that drove a higher tax rate. I don't know if you have any comment on what those things might be and what's the tax rate going forward?", "Aleem Gillani", "Matt, it's Aleem. There were several individual tax items that affected us this particular quarter. There are actually several of those every quarter. That's sort of a normal thing. There are always going to be some adjustments. Typically, some go positive, some go negative, and they may average out overall. This quarter, we had several which ended up actually just being net unfavorable, and that raised our effective tax rate. But if you think about what our normalized tax rate is and how that looks over time, as a general rule, think about us as having sort of $100 million to $120 million of tax-free income. So if you take a look at our overall income, subtract $100 million to $120 million per quarter of tax-free income and then apply our marginal rate to the remainder, you sort of get a generally effective tax rate number. What that tells you is that over time, as our income rises, our effective tax rate should be rising also as our marginal rate then gets applied to a higher proportion of our total income.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Securities.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I wanted to ask you about the credit-related expenses. If you look at the metrics and what we've seen in net charge-offs and nonperformers, they're all moving in a favorable direction. But when you look at the credit-related expenses this quarter, we actually saw about a $40 million increase to a number that was higher than what we've seen in the last 3 or 4 quarters. So was there any kind of proactive cleanup or some things that we did on the balance sheet that pushed that number up this quarter?", "William Rogers", "This is Bill. The largest part of that was really operating losses and the increase in operating losses. And that line item was impacted by sort of legal and compliance-related accruals, the preponderance of those being mortgage related, which I don't think would be a surprise to anybody.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Right. And [indiscernible] something we hadn't added [ph] that came out this quarter that allowed us to make those and then who knows what going forward, but at this point, we wouldn't see that reoccurring as much or at that level?", "William Rogers", "Well, I can't promise that. I mean, new information comes out and we have to react to it and things that are, as my accounting friends will say, estimable and probable. So when we know them in that category, we'll address them, and they were in that category for this quarter.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Okay. And then last question was, as we look at our normalized kind of earnings going forward, one of the things that in the past, you all had just a pristine kind of asset quality experience, so we always assume that your [indiscernible] was going to kind of cycle through run rates are going to be relatively low, especially compared to your peers. Now that we've gone through a little more stressful period and the Southeast was hit a little bit harder, I think it was kind of [indiscernible] higher. Is that part of why we go through this efficiency initiative to get back to normalized kind of profitability levels above 1% ROA [indiscernible] assuming higher in this cycle kind of losses?", "William Rogers", "Yes. I think when you sort of crank through that math, you could assume we've operated in the high 30s to low 40s in our past. And will we ever get back to that kind of level as a country and as a region and as a company? I don't know. But I think even assuming some sort of higher numbers, 50 basis points, for example, and that kind of run rate, you can still operate sort of at a north of 1% ROA. I can't tell you whether it will be at the same level as before. I can tell you we'll continue to have a focus on pristine credit quality. And I think if you look at particularly the areas where we had significant management focus and what we're known for the past, in the C&I and CRE, and our numbers really look good.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Right. And I was just wondering what the efficiency initiative -- is that part of the motivation [indiscernible] really feeling the need to keep pushing that forward or is it just as we're going forward in the environment, revenue growth is going to be [indiscernible] because of the economy, so efficiencies become more a greater of a focus?", "William Rogers", "Yes, I think it's a combination of all those things, and the keyword of that being uncertainty. And as we sit here, the certainty of a revenue increase, while we expect it and expect the economy to rebound, probably has a longer tail attached to it than we all thought. And what we want to ensure is that we go into that with the most efficient organization that we can have.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "It's a question about the earning asset growth and progression, the earning assets were down, but period ends, it looks like it was above the averages. And I'm just wondering with loans flattening out and now the securities reinvested post the TARP, are we at the point where we should start to see earning assets begin growing again?", "William Rogers", "Well, if you sort of look at our earning assets and dissect them, say, on the loan side, C&I growth was a little over 2%. So I mean, we're starting to see some real C&I growth. For us, it's the flattening out is offset by the fact that we had significant, continued decrease in our -- what we labeled higher-risk loan categories. Those will start to level off. They won't go to 0. Those will start to level off. And as we continue to see improvement, particularly on the C&I side, which appears to be significantly leading the consumer side, I'm more optimistic that we'll have core asset growth.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. And just my second clarification. I hate to come back to the expensing again, but I just wanted to make sure that the point you're making is that whatever we take out of expenses is separate from what you'll also be investing in the business over time. So I just want to make sure, are we supposed to think about it as a purposeful net reduction to whatever around that $5.5 billion number it is? Or is it that $5.5 billion number before we consider ongoing investments that you'll always be continuing to make in the business?", "William Rogers", "I think you need to think of it as a net reduction, sort of a permanent $300 million reduction and -- off that base, and then we will continue to make investments in the business. And those investments will be funded, call it self-funded, by the growth in our respective businesses.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Right. So in line with revenue growth, you'll be investing within the businesses?", "William Rogers", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I just wanted to follow up on the mortgage repurchase trends. You certainly noted the increase in the repurchase demands in 2007, and I know it's relatively small numbers. But I was just curious about the increase in the repurchase demand from 2009 to 2011 vintage mortgages. That strikes me as a little interesting given that most of the focus has been on the pre-2008 vintages. So if you can just provide some color on that, that would be helpful.", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure thing, Matt. It's Aleem. The agencies are often just changing their internal processes for sampling and for file review. So it's hard for us to pinpoint what leads to a change like this. The increase this quarter that you saw actually related more specifically to the 2010 vintage. And overall, it doesn't overly concern us for several reasons. These were demands and our success rate in refuting this vintage of demand is actually very high. The loss content in this vintage is expected to be very small, given the tightening of overall credit guidelines and the focus on quality in 2010. And to date, we've actually repurchased a very small amount of loans from the 2010 vintage. In fact, our total losses to date on the 2010 vintage have been less than $1 million.", "William Rogers", "Aleem, let me provide a little bit of point of clarification, just to make sure that we answer the question. So you asked about the 2009 and 2010 increase in demands and our experience, which Aleem answered. But you might have gotten an implication that increase in demands for this quarter actually was sort of from the vintage -- pre-vintage that you are thinking about. So you asked sort of 2 different questions. Is that fair?", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "I think so, yes. And Jim, if I could follow up with a question really on your branch system? Clearly, you've done a lot of work trying to assess what your customers need, how your customers want the products delivered, particularly in the new regulatory environment. Within the focus that you're providing in terms of cost reduction, how are you thinking about your branch network and how aggressively you want to grow or perhaps shrink that part of the business over the next 3 years or so to provide the service level that your customers want but also right size the expense base?", "William Rogers", "Yes, I mean, we'll be looking at that. We come into this within our markets as one of the most convenient branch operating networks in our region. And that's a combination of our traditional branches and a good reliance on our in-store. So we go into it with an entity that's fairly efficient. I think it'll be more in the thought of how we staff and run that network versus big increases or big decreases in branches. I think that's probably a better way to think about it as we start shifting more consumer activity to online channels, ATM channels, which we've been very successful of introduction of technology. So I think it'll be -- think more of the efficiency within the boxes versus a large number of increases versus decreases.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Scott Valentin with FBR Capital Markets.", "Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Just a little bit of a philosophical question. As capital frees up and you seek to grow the balance sheet, what's the thought process regarding margin versus the net interest income? In other words, if loan growth remains tepid, do you then start growing the securities book and we can expect a decline in margin? Or would you then decide some way that maybe not growing the company as fast and allocate capital elsewhere?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think the -- from a margin perspective, we are very focused on what our clients are doing, and we're trying to make sure that we're there for them. And so to the extent that we can grow the loan book and focus on our client business, that's what we will be trying to do first. To the extent that loan growth does remain tepid and deposit growth continues to -- cash continues to flow in, about the only place we can put excess cash for now is, in fact, in the securities book. So we will be growing securities if that happens. Having said that, we're also focused on the potential rate risk within the securities book, so we'll be managing that very closely to make sure we don't overemphasize that book over time.", "Scott Valentin - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "Okay. And just as a follow-up, in terms of the Durbin impact and some of the offsets, your deposit -- I'm sorry, on Reg E, your deposit service charges were up link quarter. Should we expect additional growth in deposit service charges as we go forward?", "Mark Chancy", "Scott, that's where the interchange income gets booked, so I think starting in the fourth quarter, as you see Durbin come into effect, so it's actually in card fees, that's where you'll see the card fees to come down. As you look at deposit fees, some of the things that Bill talked about earlier in the context of the new checking product suite and some value-added features would be where the majority of that would flow through.", "William Rogers", "Yes. And one of the reasons they're up is just new accounts. I mean so we've been successful at expanding and growing our business, so the core -- not related to any fee or particular issue, but just growing more accounts and due to the investments we've made on the service quality side, we're losing fewer.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "A couple of questions. One is on just cost of funds. Could you just give us a sense as to what levers you see in managing cost of funds to be as low as possible over the next couple of quarters?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Betsy, I think, 2 major levers we see there. Number one, on the deposit side. As you know, rates are very low. We've managed to extract a lot of value by driving deposit costs lower over the last several quarters. I think some of that is -- or most of that has played out. However, perhaps not all, so we're hoping to be able to grind out an extra basis point or 2 in our deposit costs and bring our overall cost of funds down there somewhat. Secondly, as you know, we've been very active on our liability management side, done a tender for a bit. We've repurchased it. We've had some high-cost debt maturities, and we're going to continue to stay focused on that to bring down whatever we can on the -- on our high-cost debt side. So I think those are the 2 major levers we'll be focusing on when it comes to cost of funds.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "And degree of impact on NIM you think those have?", "Aleem Gillani", "It will be positive, but I think it will be slightly outweighed by the maturing loans that we have on the asset side. And as those loans mature, we'll be reinvesting that cash into new loans. And new loans are coming on at slightly lower rates in the current low-yield environment. So overall, I do think that our NIM will decline a little bit as we look to Q3 and Q4.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just separately on the dividends, you mentioned that you were going to be requesting a dividend hike from the Board of Directors. I would expect that, that would need to be passed by the Fed as well [indiscernible] and sort of how you're thinking about payout ratios and the like as you put the request in?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, over time, over the long run, we do expect our payout ratio to climb. You're aware that the Fed, through the SICAR process, appears to have limited or capped the total amount of payout ratios for all of the 19 banks in the SICAR process. But over time, we do expect that our payout ratio would climb toward that kind of a number, and we're looking for ways in which we can return capital to shareholders.", "William Rogers", "And to set expectations, I mean, Aleem did say modest increase we'd be asking for [indiscernible] second half of the year, which is consistent where we've been all year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kevin Fitzsimmons with Sandler O'Neill.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "Just 1 clarification. I know you quantified the revenue base that's being affected by Durbin and then you're going to be putting these mitigating steps in, you're going to look to recapture 50% of the revenues lost from that, but also Reg E. I'm assuming Reg E is already in the run rate. Can you quantify how much has been lost from Reg E so if we have to think about you recapturing 50% of that, what that is?", "William Rogers", "How about if I just do it in sort of total run rates of which we've talked about before? So we talked about a range on Reg E of $80 million to $120 million sort of normalized run rate. Let's just use the high end of that for just purpose of the discussion. And then Durbin, has about a 307 [indiscernible] rate as to where we are right now, so you've got $180-ish-plus million [indiscernible] as it relates to that. So that's the total run rate number that we're talking about offsetting 50% of. And I think -- and I hope and I think that that's a conservative estimate because I think the high end of both ranges and the low end of the range are offsetting. So I think we'll be somewhat north of 50% in terms of recovery of that total run rate number. [indiscernible] clarify.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "That's great. And one quick [indiscernible] net charge-offs in the third quarter maybe approximate to where they were in the second quarter. How about the pace of reserving? Should we expect -- as long as credit metrics continue to improve, do we expect you to continue to release, but maybe not at the pace we've seen for the past couple of quarters?", "Thomas Freeman", "It's Tom Freeman. As we've looked at the pace of release about what's going on, I think the release of the reserve will stay in line with the improvement in credit metrics. We expect the credit metrics to continue to improve over the next several quarters. We think the release actually lags by a couple of quarters, the improvement in credit quality. Because you want to make sure that what you're not getting is a false signal in an individual quarter. So we've been pretty cautious about the amount of money we've released out of the reserves [ph].", "Operator", "Our next question is from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners.", "Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC", "[indiscernible] acquisition. And I guess the question really relates more to as folks bring opportunities to you -- and I'm thinking more smaller than anything large or strategic, do you want the organization to be at a particular point before you consider them? Or do you feel you can consider acquisitions or the things that are related to the franchise now?", "William Rogers", "Yes. I mean, Chris, we've got a core competency, so I mean, it's not that we can't handle it. I mean, we've got people and systems and process and competency in doing this. But all that being said, I mean, I'm spending 99% of my time on our franchise because I think we've got such an upside and opportunity within our own franchise. That's where I'm devoting most of my time. But we have competencies, so we would look at things. But we kept out of the FDIC buyout of small bank just because we thought it would be a diversion, quite frankly, to our overall objective of what we're trying to accomplish. And I want to just make sure that the company is, again, focused on the opportunity within our franchise.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bob Patten with Morgan Keegan.", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Just a quick question. Could you -- 1% ROA seems kind of like a low bar for what SunTrust -- the history of SunTrust. Can you give us sort of a reminder of what the long-term return profile of the company is going to look like, ROE, ROA, earnings growth efficiency, and sort of when you think you're going to get there?", "Aleem Gillani", "We don't normally guide toward long-term ROE and ROA targets. And with the current uncertainty, of course, it's very hard for any bank to do that over time. We have set ourselves an ROA target. We have set ourselves an efficiency target. And what we are focused on is really excellent execution within our franchise and delivering the bank to all of our clients. So over time, I do think that you will see from us an ROA that will be north of 1%. I think you will see from us an efficiency ratio that will be below 60%. But we frankly don't guide to long-term ROE targets.", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Did you guys give a timeframe of when you hope to attain the 1% ROA?", "William Rogers", "We didn't. And really, what I was trying to sort of going through the math was an ability to just sort of get to a calculation where you can see to north of 1%. A lot of this is obviously just is economic driven. Sort of when are we going to see in improvement in general economy such that those normalized charge-off ratios we talked about earlier and normalized credit expenses will start to materialize? Those are less in our control. The things that we can control is the expense base and the chassis from which we attack the business, and that's what we're going to be -- have a laser focus on.", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "And then just last question for Bill. How much of your time are you spending with the regulators on your daily job today versus, say, a year ago?", "William Rogers", "Well, a year ago, I wasn't in this slot, so. Let me sort of start that from that framework. It's hard to put a percentage of the time. We've got a great team. We have a lot of focus. We spend time with our regulators. Can I put a specific percentage on it? No. Am I focused every day to make sure that I'm balancing how much time we're spending with the regulators, ensuring that we're doing all the right things, complying with the consent order, all of the things that we need to be doing to making sure that we're on the right track, but also ensuring the fact that I'm spending enough time on running the business and making sure that we're achieving our objectives. So I haven't done the calendar calculation on that. So I don't know if I've dodged your answer or answered it, but...", "Robert Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc.", "No, I understand what you're saying. It's just a point of I was just trying to see how much time is being taken up by non-revenue producing issues with the regulators and so forth versus...", "William Rogers", "I think one of things -- and this was Jim's leadership -- is if you go down one layer in our company, they're spending the appropriate amount of time on running the business. Now there are a few of us that are spending a higher percentage on regulatory things than we'd like to, and than we will going forward. But the core team in the field, the guys running our businesses, they're certainly doing the things they need to do to respond to the regulatory issues. But they're running the business, and we're very focused on ensuring that we've got that right balance.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Just a couple of follow-ups. Bill, you mentioned before, just on the expenses, some of the structural changes. And I'm just curious, with some of the changes that are coming through within the mortgage business and the mortgage industry, just wondering kind of as you guys are addressing some of the recent Fed orders and so forth, how are you thinking about the mortgage business today and kind of going forward? And does that potentially kind of fall into your outlook in terms of some of the structural changes that you're thinking about on the expense side?", "William Rogers", "Yes, in fairness, related to the expense thing, I've really sort of tried to exclude mortgage from that discussion because it'll have ups and downs and offsets as originations goes down and the regulatory expenses go up. So I've tried to [indiscernible] that from the overall expense discussion. Now that being said, if you're asking the question are we going to be in the mortgage business going forward, I mean, mortgage has been an important part of what we do. 1 in 5 of our clients who have a mortgage have it with SunTrust. We've got a lot of our new client origination comes from the mortgage channel. Will we evaluate the efficiency and productivity in that business going forward? Absolutely. Will we look at sort of what volumes of servicing we have versus what volumes of origination? Are we going to be in retail? Are we going to be in the [indiscernible] we are and will be evaluating all of that. But mortgage is a core business for SunTrust. It's been a big part of the relationship strategy that we have as a company.", "Todd Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just as follow-up. Operating leverage was negative this quarter, and certainly, the -- addressing expenses is obviously important. But how should we think about just kind of generating positive operating leverage going forward? You mentioned that a small amount of the cost saves were likely to come out in the back half of 2011. But as I look at the business mix and some of the seasonality and some of the headwinds in the back half of the year, how should we think about kind of positive operating leverage going forward and kind of the timing of that?", "William Rogers", "Well, we did talk about the expense run rate, the expenses being a little less impacted this year. And that's really because we're trying to put in structural permanent changes in the business such that we've got a permanent run rate and smaller chassis as we approach the business. So this isn't a quick fix, go lop off a lot of expenses just to accomplish a short-term objective. By the same token, we have the same amount of intensity on a bunch of revenue opportunities. And you've seen the growth on our deposit business. You've started to see some of that C&I growth starting to come back. That's supported by really good production numbers, increases in commitments, which bode well for the future. And you've seen things like, in our fee businesses, our Investment Banking business, which is sort of significantly run rate, last 4 quarters, above where it was 4 quarters before that. So the answer is, I can't give you specific timing other than to say I can assure you the focus is on both ends of that equation.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "Aleem, you didn't talk -- I don't think you talked too much about the margin and what the drivers are of it in the future. Can you talk about your outlook for the margin?", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure thing, Jefferson. So over the next couple of quarters, obviously, there are some headwinds and tailwinds in the margin overall. The -- I think, overall, we are guiding and I do expect that we'll have a modestly declined margin from the 3.53% that you saw this quarter and in the first quarter. And the primary reason for that really are maturing loans. So there is good [indiscernible] bad news there. The good news is that there are clients in America who do believe in repaying their debts. And so we are having some loans mature. And the bad news, of course, is that we're putting on new loans at slightly lower yields than the old ones came off at.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.", "All right. And a follow-up, when I look at that rate bucket sheet, I see a 4.36% rate beside that brokerage CD number. Are those just old CDs or they -- or some hedging stuff going through there? Or what's that large rate cost doing there?", "Aleem Gillani", "Those are silks. Those are the $2.3 billion of silks that we'd put on some time ago. They are old, and the overall duration of that portfolio is coming down. I think we're down to under 3 years now on that particular book. You can see the overall balance of brokered CDs has been falling very considerably year-over-year. This is not an area of focus for us.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, everybody, for joining us.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kris Dickson, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to SunTrust Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us. ", "In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. ", "Discussing our earnings presentation today will be Bill Rogers, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today, among other members of our executive management team, are Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer; C. T. Hill, our Head of Consumer Banking, and Mark Chancy, our Head of Wholesale Banking. ", "Before we get started, I need to remind you our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website. ", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance.

", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "William Henry Rogers", "Thanks, Kris. I'll keep my introductory comments brief this morning and then let Aleem get right into the review of the quarter so we can get grounded in the numbers. I'll come back on afterwards and share my perspective before the Q&A. ", "If you turn to Slide 3, I think that's a good summary of the quarter, and I'm pleased to report we have momentum in several key areas, fueled in part by our intense client-centric focus. Loans were up again this quarter with targeted portfolio growth exceeding planned declines in higher-risk categories. We continued to grow deposits with a favorable mix shift, and key credit quality metrics improved across-the-board. We are pursuing initiatives to help drive better performance over time, including, but not limited to, our expense reduction program. I'll revisit that topic later in the call. ", "But first, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some color on this quarter's financial results.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. I'll begin my comments today with the summary income statement on Slide 4. I'll provide you greater detail into the primary performance drivers on subsequent slides. So for now, I'll just hit the highlights. ", "Earnings per share this quarter were $0.39. That's a $0.06 per share increase from the second quarter, primarily due to a lower provision resulting from improved credit trends. Compared to the third quarter of last year, earnings per share increased $0.22. The largest drivers were higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP drag. The improving profitability trends that we've reported over the past couple of years are evident in the year-to-date figures. 2011 earnings per share were $0.81, which obviously compares favorably to the net loss that we reported during the first 9 months of last year. ", "If you'll turn to Slide 5, we'll drill down further into our performance beginning with net interest income and net interest margin trends. Third quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $7 million or 1%. This was due to an additional day during the third quarter and a decline in interest expense, which was primarily attributable to lower deposit rates and the continuation of the favorable deposit mix shift. The net interest margin decline of 4 basis points was consistent with our guidance and primarily driven by lower earning asset yields. Relative to the third quarter of last year, net interest income increased $27 million or 2%, and the margin increased 8 basis points. This was the result of a 29 basis point decline in interest-bearing liability costs due to favorable deposit trends and a reduction in longer-term debt. This benefit more than offset the 17 basis point decline in earning asset -- in interest-earning asset yields due to lower rates. ", "On a year-to-date basis, net interest income increased 5%, again due primarily to lower liability costs. As we look to the fourth quarter, particularly in light of the low rate environment, we expect a similar decline in the net interest margin to that experienced in the third quarter. ", "Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. As in previous quarters, we have made certain adjustments to our noninterest income for items like securities gains and mark-to-market impacts, and the details of these adjustments are included within the appendix. The major components of this quarter's $63 million adjustment included $78 million in valuation gains that were recognized on the company's fair value debt and index-linked CDs, partially offset by $21 million in valuation losses on previously secured securitized loans and illiquid securities. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined by $21 million this quarter. Investment Banking revenue was down $27 million, coming off a high second quarter as transaction volume decreased in light of the market volatility. That same market volatility in August also resulted in somewhat lower core trading revenue. Mortgage production income was up by $37 million this quarter on an adjusted basis. Core production income rose by about $65 million as a result of increased origination volume as well as wider margins. Partially offsetting this was $27 million of higher mortgage repurchase costs, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. ", "Notwithstanding the stronger sequential quarter mortgage performance, mortgage-related revenue was lower than the third quarter last year when we saw extremely high levels of refinance volume, as well as very strong MSR hedge performance. These were the primary drivers of the approximate $200 million decline in adjusted noninterest income from a year ago. ", "On a year-to-date basis, noninterest income was stable with 2010 levels. Double-digit growth in core consumer and commercial fee categories like Investment Banking, card fees and retail investment services was offset by lower mortgage revenue, as well as lower deposit service charges due to Reg E. ", "As you are aware, our debit interchange revenue will decline beginning in the fourth quarter. As mentioned last quarter, we expect about a 50% reduction, which equates to approximately $45 million to $50 million per quarter. We continue to expect to mitigate about 50% of the approximate $300 million combined annual revenue reductions from Reg E and debit interchange. Most of that mitigation should be in the run rate by early 2012, with the balance late in 2012 and in 2013. ", "Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion on mortgage repurchase trends. As shown in the top left portion of the slide, new repurchase demands increased to $440 million during the quarter with the 2007 vintage continuing to be the largest component. Demands remained difficult to predict and they were elevated this quarter, which is a trend that may continue in the fourth quarter. As you can see in the bottom row of the table, almost all of the demand this quarter were agency related. ", "The top right part of the page shows that pending demands ended the quarter at $490 million. That's up only modestly from the prior quarter despite the increase in new demands as we worked hard to actively resolving these issues. You can see evidence of this in the bottom left portion of the page as charge-offs increased from second quarter levels. This was largely expected as a significant portion of last quarter's new demands came late in the month of June, thus driving up the second quarter pending population. As such and despite the fact that charge-offs declined that quarter, we had built the second quarter reserve in anticipation of this quarter's increase in resolutions. As the losses were recognized, we were able to utilize a portion of that reserve increase. The mortgage repurchase provision during the third quarter was $117 million, and the ending reserve level was $282 million. ", "Let's take a look at expenses now. Expenses increased by $18 million or 1% on a sequential-quarter basis due to mortgage-related costs. Specifically, operating losses and credit and collections expense were up a combined $19 million. Other expense line items were essentially stable. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest expense increased by $74 million. Operating losses increased by $45 million, largely attributable to mortgage servicing. Employee compensation was the other major driver, up $41 million, due to staff additions in client interfacing and mortgage loss mitigation and servicing roles. Higher incentive compensation due to improved revenue in certain businesses also contributed to this increase. Partially offsetting this was a $15 million decline in other real estate expense. And as Bill mentioned, he will provide you an update to our expense program later in the call. ", "Let's move on to the balance sheet, starting on Slide 9. Average performing loans increased by over $1 billion or about 1% from the prior quarter. Growth was driven by targeted loan categories, including C&I and consumer loans, while higher risk elements of the portfolio continued to be managed down. Commercial loan growth came from the C&I category, which increased by $1.1 billion or almost 2.5%, primarily driven by our large book of borrowers. The growth was across multiple industries, mostly in the form of increased term funding. We saw a modest increase in large corporate utilization rates and a similar increase in commitment levels for our smaller commercial clients. Growth within consumer was across all loan categories with the largest dollar increases in guaranteed student loans and indirect auto. ", "Period-end loans were up over $2.5 billion or more than 2% from the prior quarter. Notable items included increased production volume, higher loan balances during every month of the quarter and the $500 million student loan portfolio acquisition that closed at quarter end. Relative to the prior year, average loans grew almost $3.5 billion or about 3%. This growth also came from the targeted C&I and consumer portfolios. Commercial category loans increased by about $0.5 billion as strong C&I growth more than offset declines in CRE and commercial construction. The consumer portfolio was up by approximately $3.5 billion with student and indirect auto again driving the growth. Conversely, residential loans declined due to about a $2 billion combined reduction in non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and residential construction, partially offset by growth in guaranteed mortgage. ", "Overall, we are pleased with our traction in growing selected areas of the portfolio this quarter. And currently, we were also able to continue to reduce risks, and further information of this is shown on Slide 10. ", "The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk have accounted for about 50% of our net charge-offs over the past couple of years. As may be seen on this slide, these balances are down by almost $13 billion or about 55% since the fourth quarter of 2008. These portfolios fell by another $700 million this quarter with declines across all the categories, especially the commercial construction and higher-risk home equity portfolios. Overall, these higher-risk portfolios now constitute only 9% of our total loans. Less than $1 billion of this is nonperforming and has been written down or reserved for while the remainder of the book is exhibiting more favorable characteristics. For example, the performing higher-risk home equity portfolio has a refreshed averages FICO score in excess of 700. ", "At the same time that we've been managing these high-risk balances down, we've also been reducing our risk further by increasing our government-guaranteed loans. Government-guaranteed loans increased this quarter by about $650 million. And they now total $9.8 billion or 8% of our loan portfolio. ", "Let's move on now to a discussion on deposits. Average client deposits were up again, increasing by over $1 billion or about 1% from the second quarter. Favorable mix shift continued as growth was again concentrated in lower-cost categories, most notably via the $2.1 billion or 7% single quarter increase in DDA balances. Time deposits were down, and we also saw a decline in NOW balances, many of which migrated into DDA. Relative to the prior year, average deposits were up $5.7 billion or about 5%. Lower-cost deposit accounts increased by about $10 billion, which primarily came from 20% growth in DDA and 8% growth in money market. And currently, higher-cost time deposits declined by about $4 billion or 17%. ", "Moving on to credit quality. All of our primary asset quality metrics improved this quarter, largely due to favorable trends in the commercial portfolio. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, declined 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Commercial loan delinquencies were down 7 basis points while residential loans improved by a modest 2 basis points. You can see this detail in the Appendix where we've provided you the usual supplementary slides. Commercial and consumer early-stage delinquency rates of 15 and 67 basis points, respectively, are at relatively low levels. So we expect any further improvements in overall delinquencies to be driven by residential loans and to be influenced by the overall economy, particularly by changes in unemployment, and to a lesser extent, home value. We saw another quarter of meaningful improvement in nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets, which were down 10% and 8%, respectively. I'll share with you the drivers of this momentarily. ", "Net charge-offs were $492 million. This was a 3% improvement from the prior quarter and consistent with our prior guidance. In light of the overall continued credit quality improvement and risk reduction in the portfolio, we decreased the allowance for loan and lease losses by $144 million this quarter. The allowance ended the quarter at 2.22% of loans. Of note, if you exclude government-guaranteed loans from the denominator, this ratio is about 20 basis points higher. ", "Slide 13 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loan and net charge-offs [ph]. ", "Sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans marked their ninth consecutive quarterly decrease and was driven by commercial loans. Commercial construction NPLs fell $242 million or almost 40% as the result of continuing risk-mitigation activities. C&I and CRE NPLs declined by almost $60 million each or over 10%. Nonperforming residential loans were essentially unchanged. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined by $1.1 billion or 26%. Every loan category was down with the largest dollar declines coming from commercial construction, non-guaranteed mortgages and C&I. Net charge-offs declined by $13 million from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans as home equity and residential construction fell by a combined $17 million. Commercial charge-offs were relatively stable as an approximate $40 million sequential quarter increase in commercial construction was largely offset by about a $35 million combined decrease in C&I and CRE. Compared to last year, net charge-offs were down by about $200 million or about 30%, which was driven primarily by lower residential losses, most notably in the non-guaranteed mortgage loan category. ", "Overall, NPL declines in recent quarters have been driven by commercial category loans as the higher-risk commercial construction portfolio has been reduced while the C&I book has generally performed well overall. Residential loans have been the largest driver of our lower net charge-offs. This portfolio has seen notable improvements over the past year, although that stabilized somewhat this quarter. Taking this together, we expect the third quarter trends to be similar in the fourth quarter, specifically additional declines in nonperforming loans with generally stable net charge-offs. ", "I'll conclude my comments today on Slide 14 with the discussion of capital. The Tier 1 common ratio expanded to an estimated 9.25% while the Tier 1 capital ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 11.05%. The latter was down marginally due to a modest reduction in our outstanding trust preferred securities, as well as the impact of loan growth on risk-weighted assets. Both of these ratios continue to be well above the current and proposed regulatory requirement. The tangible common equity ratio expanded by over 30 basis points due to higher retained earnings, as well as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income due to higher unrealized gains in our securities portfolio. Those same factors drove a 4% increase in tangible book value per share, which ended the quarter at $25.60. ", "We told you on the last call that we intended to approach our Board requesting a modest dividend -- a common dividend increase. We did so and received their approval. And we announced during the third quarter a 4% share -- a $0.04 per share increase in the quarterly dividend. Separately, we also repurchased and retired about 4 million SunTrust warrants during a public auction conducted by the U.S. Treasury. While both of these actions were relatively small, they are consistent with our desire to increase the return of capital to our shareholders. ", "With that, and to lead us through a discussion of our strategic growth initiatives, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.", "William Henry Rogers", "Great. Thanks, Aleem. I'm going to take us to Slide 15. And as we discussed before, we're pursuing specific strategies to drive higher profitability and growth from a more diversified platform. I think this slide shows 3 of the 4 main categories and provides some examples of the success we've already garnered. The fourth category, improved expense efficiency, will be covered on the subsequent slide. ", "While there are certainly more to come on each of these fronts, I wanted to provide some data points to demonstrate the momentum we're generating. There are several interrelated components to our strategy for growing consumer market and wallet share. Most importantly, the initiatives are grounded in our ability to win by providing the best service to drive improved client loyalty and better relationship penetration. We believe this is a critical means of differentiating ourselves in the market place and is resonating well with our clients on a very broad basis. ", "As you heard earlier, evidence of this is showing up in absolute deposit growth as DDA balances are up 7% over the prior quarter. Lower-cost deposit increases more than offset the decline in higher-cost deposits, maintaining our favorable mix shift. A relative growth, however, was evidenced in the recent FDIC deposit share data as we increased share in 8 of our top MSAs.", "Last quarter, I indicated that we were beginning the planning for our new checking product suite. This was the result of extensive client research and is now in full implementation mode. We discontinued free checking and introduced our new Everyday Checking product. Everyday Checking carries a monthly maintenance fee, which can be waived by holding a $500 daily balance or by simply having a direct deposit into the account. Everyday Checking also has a monthly check card fee for unlimited check card usage, which is assessed only when the card is used on a monthly cycle at the point of sale. Now as was expected, we're opening fewer accounts. However, the average balance of the new accounts are twice as high as those opened under free checking. We're also seeing triple digit growth in the sale of our higher tier accounts, which require higher balances and a greater breadth of relationship with SunTrust. So on various fronts, this conversion is meeting or exceeding our expectations. ", "Another strategic priority is better diversification of our loan portfolio. Our C&I and consumer books grew by combined $7 billion over the last year. More importantly, production in C&I and consumer were particularly strong this quarter, and we saw some improvement in utilization in large corporate and an increase in total commitments in core commercial. Our guaranteed portfolios, both residential and student, have also been growing and contributing to both our diversification and risk improvement. All this growth more than offset the targeted reductions in our non-guaranteed residential loans, which are down $2 billion since the third quarter of last year, including a $1 billion decline in home equity. So overall good progress toward this objective as well. ", "A better diversification also applies to our business mix and fee income. Expanding wholesale business is a key strategic element in this priority, and we generated significant momentum on this front. While the third quarter was impacted by an industry-wide decline in capital markets revenue, Corporate and Investment Banking year-to-date revenue was up 16% and net income was up 23%. Diversified Commercial Banking revenue is up 9% and net income is up 34%. Growing our private wealth business is also a priority and you see we've had some success here as well as retail service income was up almost 20%. ", "Now moving onto our expense initiatives in Slide 16. So anticipating a tougher operating environment earlier this year, we embarked upon the development of a program to uncover additional ways to make significant and permanent expense reduction throughout the organization. As a result of those efforts, we announced to you last quarter our plans to eliminate $300 million in run rate expenses by the end of 2013. Today, I'd like to provide some more specificity around what we're doing to accomplish that goal. ", "First, you'll notice that this program now has a name, which is the PPG Expense Initiative. PPG is an acronym for playbook for profitable growth. It's what we call the collection of initiatives across the organization that we believe, over time, will be a key component in our plan to reduce our efficiency ratio to under 60%. As you can imagine, there are numerous initiatives in place under this program, but for purposes of communicating our progress, we've categorized them into a few core buckets, which you can see depicted on the slide. As we move through the process, we'll be updating you on the status of these with increasing accuracy and transparency. ", "The bar across the top of the page will be filled in overtime with real dollar progress towards our program goal. As we've previously stated, only a small portion of the savings will actually be realized in 2011 and as such the dollar impact of our efforts, thus far, has not been meaningful. We have, however, made significant progress on our overall plan and are in full implementation mode on several large and dozens of smaller initiatives. I'll remind you that the $300 million in expense reductions are above and beyond the expected credit-related expense and mortgage repurchase reserve normalization that undoubtedly will occur -- undoubtedly occur as the economic environment improves. The sub-60 efficiency ratio goal is the culmination of both the program and these expected normalizations. ", "So let me move to some of the specific initiatives. So first, starting with the strategic supply management effort. That's focused on not only securing even more competitive pricing from our supply base, but also proactively further managing down our own demand and assessing value received for costs incurred. Nearly all outside spend areas are in scope and the entire enterprise is in the game. The broad categories for which we are providing status updates are: Discretionary spending, demand management and outsourcing. Immediate actions have been taken to further reduce expense in obvious discretionary areas. But more importantly, we're enhancing our engagement model focused on sustaining these new lower levels of spending. ", "The next key component of the program is the consumer bank efficiencies initiatives, which includes channel optimization, alternative channel management and sales and service productivity. As we've articulated previously, we've made numerous investments in client-facing technology such as mobile and ATM enhancements, which have supported and enabled a meaningful shift in clients' willingness to use self-service channels. As clients utilize these channels, it allows us to evaluate other aspects of our consumer delivery model such as our branch network. This is not a widespread branch-reduction exercise, though it will include some branch rationalization and core changes to our branch staffing model. There are going to be increases in key opportunity branches, but overall, net reductions to reflect reduced transaction volume. The changes are underway, and we'll begin to see the results early next year. The objective is to accomplish this while maintaining the key momentum we've established in our industry-leading loyalty. ", "Operations staff and support is the final of the 3 main categories of savings and includes our shared service initiatives along with digital technology and lean process design and management. ", "Within our corporate operations, there will be strategic consolidation of certain areas where redundancies have been identified. Today, some aspects of our corporate functions are performed in multiple parts of our organization like corporate staff within the lines of business and/or within the geographic units. Our future model will use a more centralized approach for support functions with more centers of excellence while preserving our key local sales and service delivery model. We expect that this will enable us to perform functions like marketing, procurement, technology and human resources more efficiently and more effectively. ", "We're also pursuing other opportunities such as standard reporting through all elements of the organization. ", "Digital technology, in this case, refers to a set of initiatives designed to significantly increase both our internal and our clients' use of digital solutions. We're uncovering means of reducing the amount of printed material in our interactions with clients in the day-to-day operations of our branches and across the bank. It also includes efforts to improve adoption rates of our more robust digital solutions by our clients. ", "While many of the initiatives are very specific like consolidations, redundancy eliminations and spans and layers analysis, we're also incorporating lean tools and technologies in to virtually the whole bank to boost productivity. We've had much success in using lean process principles in our technology and operations area to help drive large-scale transformational improvements. We plan to adopt these on a more widespread basis across more disciplines. ", "As the PPG expense program progresses, we'll provide status updates on each of the major initiatives outlined on this slide along with the real dollars that are coming out of our expense base as they are realized. I want to assure you this program has my full attention, and I'm confident that we've built the resources and have the intensity to accomplish our objective. ", "So in conclusion and before we open up the call for Q&A, I'll note that while our bottom line performance is not yet where we'd like it to be, progress is being made. Momentum is building around the initiatives we have in place to grow targeted businesses, better diversify the loan portfolio and reduce expenses. While the future may be a little less certain, virtually all of our asset quality metrics improved this quarter. Our client first mandate and focus on having a talented, highly engaged workforce is being recognized and rewarded by our clients. And all that's being done with an eye towards driving better return for our shareholders. I have great confidence we've got the right priorities in place. We have a great team leading our company. We have focused teammates working towards a common objective. ", "Now before we turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to take a little liberty to thank the teammates who are on this call as they are what define SunTrust. ", "So with that said, Kris, let me hand it back over to you, and we'll start the Q&A", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, Bill. When we're ready to open up the call for Q&A, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question, followed by one follow-up.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim Partners.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "A question I wanted to focus on was really the credit-related expenses. And what we've seen the last 2 quarters is that number kind of moving back up and kind of this quarter we picked our head back above $200 million. Was just curious if as we saw the DVA [ph] coming in and we had some positive movement on that side if we didn't see some opportunity to kind of make sure we were working real hard to get some of these things behind us as we go on through the quarter.", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, it's Aleem. Yes, we're actually working very hard to do that and you, I think, saw a little bit of that happening this quarter. We've got a team of people, particularly on the mortgage side and on the putback side working to see how many of those demands that come in we're able to refute, working very hard to see of those demands that we accept, how we limit the severity of those things. You saw that in the amount of overall resolution that happened this quarter, so I think there's a real -- you've got a team of people who are working hard and I think you saw some of that actually take place this quarter.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And do you think that this 2011 kind of number starts to work its way down now as we've seen the asset quality improvements, or is this kind of the inflection point when we'll start seeing some improvement as we move forward?", "Aleem Gillani", "I'll answer and then I think Tom Freeman will jump in with some color. I think that's real hard to say, Marty. That's really sort of an overall economic issue. We are exposed to the economy, the whole financial system is. And the primary driver overall for credit for us, as you know, is unemployment. And as the economy goes, we're leveraged to that, we'll go the same way.", "Thomas E. Freeman", "So Marty, I think while you've seen some increase in those costs as they're put together, especially on Slide 27 when you look at the detail that's put together, the core cost of running the workout businesses are remaining relatively flat and starting to decline a little bit. And what Aleem was speaking to is we're working really hard on the return loans from the agencies and making sure that we've got that stuff rationalized in the appropriate manner. I think staff is looked at, we're rebalancing our staff as our workloads go down and I think this stuff is dependent upon the number of defaults going forward as Aleem just told you. And we've had pretty good luck so far. I think right now it continues to improve. But, boy, it's an uncertain environment out there right now.", "William Henry Rogers", "And Marty, I'd add -- this is Bill, that some of the operating losses are fees related to the delays in the foreclosure process. And you'd presume over time those will absolutely come down.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on an expense-related question. As we think about the $240 million of run rate savings you expect to get by the end of next year, how should we think about that progressing from the fourth quarter of 2011 throughout next year? Is that somewhat even? Is it going to be back ended?", "William Henry Rogers", "I would think about it as starting in the second quarter and then lower in the first quarter and then start progressively quarter by quarter through the fourth quarter, so not totally back ended, but clearly progressive. And it just makes sense. I mean, if you got to start run rate expenses, you should build [ph] that way.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. But I guess in terms of the timing of implementation of a lot of these projects, it's more likely to kick in starting in the second quarter then?", "William Henry Rogers", "Well, it's things like implementation are today, I mean that's when it started. I mean, the example on the branch piece is we're already down in some areas in branch FTEs. You just won't see the run rate part of that until the first and second quarter, so implementation -- I don't want to send a mixed message. Implementation is now. We're more than fully underway.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, the detail of the government-guaranteed loans that you've provided is helpful in terms of separating the mortgage and the student, and you gave us the yields and everything. Can you give us a sense, though of what type of duration you're adding, the mortgage spreads of 3.6%; student, 4.4%? Obviously, they look low on an absolute basis, but if there's no credit risk, it can provide a different picture. But what type of duration on the mortgage side? And then just remind us on the student, the duration of how those loans are as well?", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure thing. It's Aleem. The duration is actually quite varied, as you pointed out, depending on the type of loan that we're adding. On the mortgage side, we're adding anywhere from adjustable-rate mortgages out to 15-year fixed, out to 30-year fixed. So the overall duration across those is mixed. On the student loan side, those tend to be relatively shorter-duration loans overall. But overall, when you look at the duration of the balance sheet in total, holistically, including those loans, including everything else we've got, both on the asset and liability side, the duration of the entire balance sheet is coming down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, mostly as a function of rates coming down.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Billy, a big focus of the quarter with the banks has been capital planning, capital management kind of going into 2012 and the CCAR progress. As you mentioned, you guys recently raised your dividend, paid back or repurchased some of the warrants from Treasury. How should we think about kind of 2012 with the capital, Bill, that you've seen this year, yet it's a bit -- again the economy we're hearing more about kind of the uncertain environment going into 2012? For SunTrust, how do we think about kind of your priorities in terms of dividends, buyback, redeeming more trust preferred and other types of things that you might be thinking about contemplating in perhaps more uncertain world in 2012?", "William Henry Rogers", "Let me take it at a pretty high level and then Aleem might want to embellish my answer, and it probably is worthwhile actually going back a little bit to last year in the CCAR process. So if you think about last year, our submission was focused on minimizing shareholder dilution and that was #1, 2 and 3 in terms of our priorities. So that set the tone for where we started from. Today -- so going into the same process now this year, we go into this with higher capital, better earnings and it would be safe to assume that we will be more balanced in our submission regarding both the dividend and share repurchase. It will be a part of what we'd be looking at. As you mentioned, this is an industry process. We all don't know the rules yet. And Aleem, I don't know if you'd want to embellish that and maybe talk about TruPs a little bit.", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure. I'll add a couple of points to Bill's answer. Not only higher capital and better earnings, but also a better structural balance sheet overall, less risk overall and even stronger liquidity. So overall, we're coming into this year stronger on every conceivable metric. And the focus of our CCAR submissions or going through the stress tests will be to help the Federal Reserve Board to understand exactly how strong we are coming into this and provide a balanced return to our shareholders in every way. Whether that be by dividends or some other type of capital action, we'll try to structure something like that in there if we can. Of course, as you know, we don't know what the rules are yet for this next CCAR. Apparently, we'll get all of those next month with a submission date some time in January and the response date back from them some time in March. On the TruPS question, you may have noticed we actually have been reducing our TruPS somewhat over the course of this year, so we've been finding ways to return capital to shareholders wherever we can.", "Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "That's very helpful. And again just going back to the dividend buyback in kind of a balanced approach, if you will, can you give us a sense in terms of how you're thinking about targeting kind of the distribution or payout overall? It seems as though still a number of companies are leaning more towards dividend versus buyback and perhaps even more cautious on kind of -- in 2011, which was a kind of a 30% guideline, how do you think about that guideline going into 2012 and how you weigh again that dividend versus buyback question?", "Aleem Gillani", ";", "Well, I'm not sure what the guideline will be for '12. We know what it was for '11, but it may not be there in '12. So we'll have to wait until we hear from them to find out exactly what that guideline is. But if and when they tell us, we will balance our submission around a guideline both on dividends as well as to try and find some other ways of returning capital to shareholders besides just dividends.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore Partners.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about your margin outlook going into 2012? I know you gave some color in terms of the fourth quarter, but can you talk about '12 and more specifically what you expect in terms of the impact on securities reinvestment yields as well is the impact on the loan yields, and how much that could influence the trajectory of the margin?", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure thing. You may have seen, as you know, sort of coming into this that we were actually positioned -- one of the few banks who is positioned not to be asset sensitive. So with the big drop in rates that we got in August, we were actually positioned a little bit better than some others and so the impact on us has been slightly less and we're coming into this in a slightly better position, I think, than some other banks. Going forward, we've given you a little bit of guidance for Q4. We do expect to see a modest margin decline in Q4 also. And then, as we look out into 2012, we're thinking about the kinds of levers that we've got to be able to protect the margin. Those kinds of levers include things like further drops in deposit rates. Overall, ability that we've had to drop deposit rates has actually extended out farther than I had initially thought it would. So that's been a pleasant surprise, and we're now looking to see how we can continue to do more of that going forward. Other levers that we've got at our disposal are going to be things like further TruPS redemptions, further payoffs of our longer-term, more expensive debt. So we've got some levers that we're going to be continuing to pull on to try and manage the margin overall. But we're focused not just on the margin, we're also focused on the net interest income number. And we're going to be trying to protect that net interest number as much as we can through 2012.", "William Henry Rogers", "And don't sort of excuse the fact also of the discipline that we put in the management of both the asset and the liability side of our balance sheet, so part of that improvement in prior quarters in NIM was just due to just a much tighter management. So to Aleem's point, that's also a continued lever.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And your implication of trying to protect the margins, you're implying there's probably a downward bias there, but you're aiming to keep it stable?", "Aleem Gillani", "I think if rates stay where they are, we'll have runoff. We do have loans paying off. We do have securities maturing. And that runoff will be invested in the current rate environment, whatever that happens to be. So if rates do stay low, I think that what you'll see for the industry, overall, will be a continued decline in margins.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then my follow-up would just be on -- you mentioned that you're focusing on supporting NII, net interest income, and can you talk a little bit about your strategy around the bond portfolio? Are you looking to move out the curve a bit there to seek a bit of yield?", "Aleem Gillani", "We're actually not pushing out the curve much. We've always had a strategy of laddering our reinvestments. Our portfolio has always had monthly cash flow. So as that cash flow has increased somewhat due to the reduction in rates more recently, we're continuing that strategy on and we're buying securities anywhere from 5-1 ARMs out to 30-year or agency MBS. We're just continuing the same strategy we've always had.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "What specifically drove the pickup in the OREO balances? And I'm wondering, could the -- maybe a little more aggressive disposition of these balances impact pre-provision earnings in the fourth quarter.", "Aleem Gillani", "So what drove the increase in the balances was the success in moving a lot of the commercial loans from a collection status to a resolution status. Actually, our success rate on the resolution activity is pretty good. We're able to dispose of the foreclosed properties very quickly once we get them in the queue for disposition. So we've been able to meet our disposition costs, our disposition activity, I think, quite well. And we control those costs, I think, pretty aggressively.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Got it. And then just kind of one housekeeping question here. Can you help us with the tax rate? I believe you pay a statutory 35%, which is offset by roughly $100 million of tax shield benefit. How should we think about this rate in the fourth quarter?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think the way to think about what our tax rate is likely to be is, that as you say, we've got about $100 million of income that's generated that's roughly tax free. And above that, we pay the statutory tax rate. So whatever your model says for what you expect our net income to be, that's generally a good way to think about that. And where we've been over the last couple of quarters, if you average those out, that works out to roughly about 18%.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And is the $100 million mostly from bonds that are tax free, or is it from like low-income housing credits?", "Aleem Gillani", "It's only partially from bonds. It's actually a lot from our overall business with local government clients.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just a question on commercial loan growth. Commercial loans were up about 2% this quarter, and I'm just curious about the competitive environment. Most of the regional banks have reported C&I loan growth that has been much stronger than the overall portfolio growth. I guess, I'm curious as to your thoughts about how competitive that environment has gotten and how pricing has responded to that, or has the backing away of some of the European players in the U.S. market provided some more opportunities so competition really hasn't gotten that bad?", "William Henry Rogers", "In fairness, you're asking and answering the question because I think that's exactly it. I mean, there are a lot of countervailing forces here. You've got the supply and demand issues of banks working hard to increase loans, counteract them. So on the commercial side, sort of low-end commercial, middle commercial, that continues to be competitive. Although I'll say our coming-on spreads are -- haven't experience the kind of decline you might expect from a highly competitive market. And then on the large-end corporate side, I mean, I think you've defined it. I mean, what's happened in the last quarter is a pretty dramatic shift. Now you won't see that in the total portfolio. But in coming-on spreads, you've had actually some increase.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And if I can, just to follow-up on Basel III. Have you estimated your Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio relative to the Basel I ratio that you reported this morning?", "Aleem Gillani", "Indeed we have, Matt and they're actually very similar. You would normally expect Basel III capital ratios to be substantially lower than Basel I ratios, but we get a benefit primarily as a result of the large unrealized gain we have in our securities portfolio. And as a result, our Basel III and Basel I numbers are coming in almost on top of each other.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And how are you thinking about managing for the liquidity requirements under Basel III? Have you started to do that or are you still waiting for a bit more guidance in terms of that part of the regulation?", "Aleem Gillani", "We're watching that very carefully. And I personally expect that the way the current regulations are written, there will be a little bit of flex in that between now and the final regulation. So we're aware of it. We're watching it. We know where we are, but I expect that there'll be little bit of change between now and when they're finalized.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Ian Foley in for Ken. A quick question for Tom. Just how should we think about reserve release going forward and where it could potentially bottom out once charge-offs normalize in the future?", "William Henry Rogers", "You're sort of breaking up. Can you repeat that question?", "Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I just wanted to talk about reserve release going forward and kind of where you think the allowance could bottom out once charge-offs normalize?", "Thomas E. Freeman", "I think if you take a look at what we've done over the past several quarters, we've given some small very gradual releases in the reserves as our credit quality metrics have continued to improve roughly about $100 million of reserve relief per quarter. This has come in conjunction with improved risk metrics across the portfolio. I think if you look relative to a year ago, delinquencies are down 25 bps, NPLs are down 25% and charge-offs are down almost 30%. And I think concurrent with the risk reduction in the portfolio, we've been growing high-quality assets, including significant portion of government guarantee. As a result of all of this, we have lower incurred losses, the GAAP basis of the reserve. Our ALLL process is rigorous, diligent and we certainly are keeping an eye on the pace of the recovery. But in light of that, we continue to keep a meaningful qualitative reserve. But overall, we feel the reserve is properly calculated and more than sufficient at the current time.", "Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then a quick question on mortgage banking and production. Just as far as revenue recognition and whether any of this quarter's spike in demand could carry through next quarter and kind of just your outlook on whether gain on sale margins are sustainable or not.", "William Henry Rogers", "Well, we just -- we had production was up 24% or so and application volume was up about just shy of 30%. So that's a pretty good indication at least for the start of the fourth quarter. And as it relates to gain on sale margins, we continue to see those at a pretty high base. This has been a pretty good environment. And again sort of early reads are that it's continuing to hold up.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about rep and warranty and just talk about GSE behavior, residual [ph] rates, severities, expectations for provision, anything you can do to help us think about how this expense changes in the future and how this -- how the total expense is going to play out over time.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Jefferson, I wish I could help you more. You know this has been a very volatile issue overall. If you think back a little bit, you know that the trends and the demands actually declined pretty substantially and more than we expected late last year. And then in the last couple of quarters, they've come back up again. So it is hard to speculate what the future activity is going to be. Assuming that demand stay elevated again in Q4 sort of seems reasonable, but it's tough to give you a good read on subsequent quarters past that. It does stand to reason that the further we get away from 2006 and the 2007 vintage, that mortgage repurchases will have less of an impact because the later vintages have tighter underwriting criteria and came in after the bulk of the housing price declines. And the improvement in our delinquency ratios, overall, do suggest that lower demands will eventually follow. But to be fair, we haven't seen what we expected so far.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the trading line item x the DDA. Can you talk about the quarter-to-quarter decline there and talk about whether the fourth quarter is the type of environment where that could bounce back? Or if you just expect some low trading revenue for a quarter or 2?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, as you know, on a reported basis, our trading line item went up. But after excluding out the adjustment items, core trading was down about $15 million to $20 million quarter-over-quarter. The majority of that really happened in August as a result of all of the market volatility and all the issues that happened in Europe. We're not a huge trader. Most of our trading positions are really kept to service our client business. But we were impacted a little bit by that risk-off trade that happened in August and concurrent with the downgrade of the U.S. debt by S&P. In the fourth quarter, I think typically, what you see happen across the industry is trading revenue generally goes down as we get into the holiday season. It's a little hard to say now what the whole quarter is going to look like.", "William Henry Rogers", "I think the important point that Aleem highlighted is this is not a big line item for us. I mean this is really only the core trading is $15 million to $20 million a quarter anyway. So this isn't going to have sort of wide variations that you might see somewhere else.", "Kristopher Dickson", "We're about out of time. I'm going to go ahead and turn it over to Bill, and he's going to wrap us up today.", "William Henry Rogers", "Okay, Kris, thanks. And I just had a couple of closing comments. We're under no illusion that the operating environment is going to be easy, but we're focused on and making meaningful progress in the areas that we can control. So just to summarize, if I could, this quarter, we saw loan growth in our targeted commercial and consumer categories. Deposits hit a record new high. Credit trends continued to improve. We grew tangible book value. And our capital ratios were well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements, including Basel III. Our strategic priorities are set. Our teammates are focused. Our results are showing signs of progress. So with that as a conclusion, thank you for joining us today.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Thanks, everyone.

And I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on the first quarter, and then I'm going to pass it over to Aleem to provide the details on the results. We'll start on Slide 3 of our presentation where we hit the high-level points. Net income for the quarter was $245 million and earnings per share was $0.46, which was $0.33 increase over last quarter and a $0.38 increase over the prior year. Growth in revenue and continued favorable loan deposit and asset quality trends drove the improved results. ", "Both net interest income and noninterest income were up over last quarter. On the net interest income side, we benefited from higher loan balances, lower cost deposit growth and a reduction in funding costs, such that our net interest margin expanded 3 basis points. Sequential quarter fee income was up sharply, and most notably in mortgage production, as low interest rates and HARP 2 drove significant refinance activity. On a year-over-year basis, fee income was stable as high mortgage revenue this quarter offset the lost income due to debit interchange changes and lower security gains. ", "Expenses declined from prior quarter, and we've made significant progress against our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense savings goal. Today, we've put in place annualized savings of $190 million, and as such, we're on track to achieve the $300 million goal for the program. So while I'm pleased with the progress, this is ultimately about establishing an efficiency-minded culture, which will allow us to exceed our goal without a bounce-back. ", "Now moving to the balance sheet. Favorable loan and deposit trends continued this quarter. Performing loans were up 3%, with growth in targeted categories and declines in high-risk loans. We also saw sustained lower-cost deposit growth. Credit quality also continued to improve with marked decreases in all primary credit metrics. Nonperforming loans were down another 9% this quarter, and net charge-offs were down 11% sequentially. ", "Lastly, we generated positive capital growth and our capital ratios remained strong and well in excess of our current and proposed regulatory requirements. ", "Now that being said, however, let me take a moment to proactively address CCAR. As part of the process moving forward, we'll be resubmitting our capital plan. We're required to submit the revised plan by mid-June and then expect to hear back by the end of the third quarter. First quarter results will be included in our submission, and we'll be running another full stress test. This new submission will only cover any proposed capital actions for the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of 2013 as anything beyond that will be incorporated in the next year's CCAR process. So we're still in the process of learning all the variables. There's not much to report at this time. We're going to be working closely with our board as we decide what to include in our revised submission. ", "So with that, Aleem, let me turn it over to you.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4 with a high-level overview of the income statement. ", "Earnings per share this quarter were $0.46, which compares favorably to the $0.13 per shares -- $0.13 per share reported last quarter and the $0.08 per share from last year. The $0.33 sequential quarter increase was driven by both higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue increased by $171 million with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income, the latter of which was largely mortgage-related. Expenses declined by $126 million, primarily the result of the $120 million fourth quarter accrual for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. ", "Relative to the prior year, the $0.38 earnings per share increase was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision resulting from improved credit quality and the elimination of the TARP dividend drag. In addition to the preferred dividend payments made that quarter, we also incurred a $74 million noncash charge related to the unamortized discount upon the redemption of the TARP shares. ", "Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. Net interest income increased sequentially by $18 million or 1%. This was driven by higher average loan balances and favorable liability trends, including reduced rates paid on deposits, strong DDA growth and lower average long-term debt. This combination of actions drove a 9 basis point decline in our liability costs this quarter, which more than offset a 5 basis point decrease in our interest-earning asset yield, leading to the 3 basis point increase in net interest margin. This increase exceeded our expectations due primarily to better-than-forecasted deposit trends. ", "Relative to the prior year, net interest income grew $65 million or 5%. This increase was driven by a $7 billion increase in average loan balances, improvements in deposit mix and pricing, including a 25% increase in DDA and $5 billion of combined reductions in longer-term debt and CD balances. ", "As you're aware, part of our overall interest rate risk management strategy includes hedging certain floating rate commercial loans with received fixed swaps. The swaps effectively convert these loans from floating to fixed rate. Net interest income attributable to the commercial loan swap position was approximately $150 million during the first quarter of 2012. And as previously disclosed, we will see about a $35 million decline from this amount in the second quarter. ", "Effectively, some of our previously fixed rate commercial loans are converting back to floating. This $35 million decline will equate to about 10 basis points of net interest margin compression. Assuming no major changes to LIBOR, commercial loan swap income is expected to remain relatively stable at this new run rate for the remainder of the year. ", "Let's turn to noninterest income on Slide 6. Noninterest income increased by $153 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher mortgage-related revenue which was up by $125 million. Excluding the $40 million decline in the mortgage repurchase provision, core mortgage production income was up by $85 million or more than 50%. Production volume this quarter was $7.7 billion, 12% increase from the fourth quarter. ", "Locked volume increased more than 30%, and we also saw wider gains on sale. About 3/4 of this quarter's volume was refinance related, and we began to take HARP 2.0 applications. Borrowers are taking advantage of this program, and we're being proactive about helping them as we think this program is a beneficial one for our clients and our country. ", "Mortgage servicing income also increased from the prior quarter, up by $59 million. This was due in part to the $38 million MSR write-down we took during the fourth quarter in anticipation of increased prepayment volume from HARP refinancings. Third quarter results also benefited from favorable net hedge performance. ", "While mortgage income was strong this quarter, certain fee categories exhibited seasonal weakness, such as deposit service charges and investment banking, which declined by $12 million and $16 million, respectively. Relative to last year, fee income was stable on a reported basis and up 7% on an adjusted basis. The primary puts and takes were higher mortgage production income, due to both increased volume and margins, and lower card fees due to the impact of the new debit interchange regulations. ", "Turn to Slide 7 to discuss mortgage repurchases. As shown in the top left portion of this slide, the purchase demands were $448 million this quarter, down by about $190 million from the high level experienced during the fourth quarter. The timing of demands continues to be variable and this quarter's decline was the result of lower demand volume from Fannie Mae. ", "Consistent with what we expressed last quarter, we believe the trends suggest that the agencies are making progress and working through the backlog of potential demands from prior years. Specifically, the composition of the demands this quarter remained concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process while the requests for full loan files, the precursor to future demands, continue to become more skewed toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. ", "Pending population, shown in the top right portion of this slide, declined by about $25 million, ending this quarter at $564 million. This was primarily the result of fewer new demands. ", "Bottom left portion of the page shows the changes in the mortgage repurchase reserve. Mortgage repurchase provision this quarter was $175 million, which exceeded the $113 million in net charge-offs. The resulting $63 million increase in the reserve was made in light of our expectation for continued high levels of future demands, as well as the belief that the decline in net charge-offs could be timing related. ", "Some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed in the bottom right of the page, and we've also provided for you in the appendix the same level of additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages that we shared last quarter. ", "Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain similar to a quarter ago. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if the patterns and full file requests and demands continue to play themselves out as expected, we continue to believe we will experience a reduced income statement impact toward the latter part of the year. ", "Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. On a reported basis, expenses declined by $126 million from the fourth quarter. This was largely the result of the $120 million accrual taken in the fourth quarter for the potential mortgage servicing settlement. We also saw a decline in credit-related expenses and operating losses. As usual, we provide some additional information on these expenses in our appendix. You'll see that, collectively, they were down by $91 million, with the primary drivers being seasonally lower credit and collections expenses, lower losses from other real estate owned and lower legal and mortgage servicing-related accruals. ", "Employee compensation and benefits increased by $173 million this quarter. You'll recall this line item was abnormally low in the fourth quarter as we curtailed our pension plan and made reductions to our 2011 incentive compensation pools. After you adjust for these 2 items, the increase this quarter was primarily related to the normal seasonal increase in employee benefits costs.", "Relative to the prior year, expenses were up by $76 million. Employee compensation and benefits increased by $43 million in light of improved performance and modest annual salary increases. Operating losses were also higher, up $33 million, as a result of specific legal and mortgage servicing accruals. Conversely, marketing and FDIC premiums and regulatory assessments were down by a combined $30 million. ", "Before we turn to the balance sheet sliding on slide -- starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize the income statement this quarter by noting that we benefited from many of the favorable trends that began to develop in the second half of 2011, and we were pleased to begin 2012 with a quarter of solid core performance. Average performing loans grew by a healthy $3.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter and were up by $8.6 billion or 8% from the prior year. The sequential quarter increase was relatively evenly split between the commercial, residential and consumer loan categories. ", "Within the commercial book, C&I was again the primary driver, up $1.1 billion or 2%. Similar to recent quarters, the growth was primarily concentrated in our large corporate and middle market segments. Large corporate growth occurred in most industry verticals, most notably, media, healthcare and energy. And momentum within the middle market segment continued to build as it was up by about 10% sequentially. Residential loan growth was driven by guaranteed loans, which increased by $1.2 billion, and was partially offset by a decline in home equity. All consumer category loans increased, led by student loans, which was up primarily due to the full benefit of loans acquired during the prior quarter. ", "The growth from last year was driven entirely by targeted categories, specifically C&I, guaranteed mortgage and consumer loans. C&I increased by $5.4 billion or 12%. Similar to the sequential quarter story, loan growth was widespread across large corporate industry verticals, as well as our middle market segment. Guaranteed mortgages were up $2.2 billion, and consumer loans grew by $4 billion, led by student and auto. Conversely, CRE, construction, home equity and non-guaranteed mortgage balances all were managed down by about $3 billion in total. This contributed to a continued derisking of the loan portfolio, which you see on Slide 10. ", "The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $13.6 billion or 58% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter with the declines evenly distributed across the 3 major categories. Higher-risk balances were managed down by $2.4 billion or 20% over the prior year. Commercial construction comprised $1 billion of the decline while higher risk home equity and mortgage balances both declined by $700 million. ", "As can be seen at the bottom of the page, the overall decline in the higher-risk balances has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans, which has helped to significantly alter the risk profile of the portfolio in a relatively short period of time. This improved risk profile becomes evident in our credit trends, which you see on Slide 11. ", "Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets and loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 9 basis points this quarter. The accelerated rate of improvement from prior quarters is attributable to normal seasonality of delinquency trends, coupled with continued improvements in the loan portfolio. We're happy to report a 29 basis point decline in indirect, a 19 basis point improvement in home equity and an 11 basis point decline in non-guaranteed mortgages. ", "Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans both declined by approximately $250 million this quarter. The 9% sequential quarter reduction in nonperforming loans is primarily driven by declines in commercial construction and residential mortgages. A portion of the residential mortgage decline was the result of our decision to move $86 million of nonperforming loans to held for sale, and we expect to complete the sale of these loans during the second quarter. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans declined about $1.3 billion or 33%, with commercial construction, C&I, CRE and residential mortgage the largest contributors. ", "Several banks this quarter reclassified into NPL, performing home equity lines that are behind delinquent first mortgages. Based upon our existing accounting policies and practices, we did not believe it was necessary for us to make a similar reclassification. However, I will point out that our reserving methodology takes this issue into account, either by the direct knowledge we have from servicing the first mortgage or via the regular refreshing of FICO scores which quickly respond to borrower delinquencies. Therefore, if we are ever required to reclassify this small population of performing loans as nonperforming, we would expect the income statement impact to be immaterial. ", "Net charge-offs were down by $50 million or 11% sequentially, which was better than our expectations. Declines came from most loan categories, most notably C&I, CRE and residential construction. These declines were partially offset by a $10 million increase in residential mortgage charge-offs, the result of the aforementioned move of certain nonperforming loans to held for sale. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by about $150 million, driven by commercial construction, residential mortgages and home equity. ", "In light of the continued improvement in credit quality, the allowance for loan and lease loss ratio declined by 9 basis points to 1.92%. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the ratio at quarter end stood at 2.16%. Overall, we're pleased with the continued improvement in credit trends. As we look to the second quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable to down net charge-offs. ", "Let's take a look at our deposit performance. This quarter, we again benefited from favorable deposit trends. Average client deposits grew $800 million, with all of that coming from lower-cost categories. DDA was the primary driver, up $1.3 billion or 4%, with growth from both consumer and commercial clients. Conversely, higher-cost time deposit balances continued their decline by $700 million or 4%. Compared to a year ago, client deposits grew by about $5 billion or 4%. DDA increased by over $7 billion or 25%. Savings was up by $600 million or 14% while time deposits declined by $2.4 billion or about 12%. We've been able to achieve this deposit growth while also closely managing pricing, demonstrated by interest-bearing deposit costs coming down 17 basis points from last year. ", "Another benefit of our strong liquidity position and DDA growth is that we reduced our average long-term debt by $2.5 billion from last year. Collectively, these favorable liability trends have resulted in an $82 million or 27% year-over-year decline in our overall interest expense, which has been a major driver of our net interest income growth. ", "Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased for the seventh consecutive quarter, up sequentially by another $200 million as a result of retained earnings. Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.3%, up from 9.22% at year end. The tangible common equity ratio increased by 5 basis points due to higher earnings which also led to the increased tangible book value per share shown in the bottom right of the page. ", "Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth Expense program. As you know, our PPG Expense program's ultimate goal is the removal of $300 million from our run rate expenses by the end of next year. To date, we've achieved $190 million of these savings on an annualized basis. This program is comprised of several fundamental expense-savings initiatives. They're broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. You can see on the bottom of the slide that many of our programs are well underway, and we've clearly attained some good initial results. ", "Our strategic supply management initiatives have lowered costs with our suppliers, as well as reduced our own demands for such services. In addition to contract renegotiations, savings are being realized through markedly reduced travel and lower usage of temporary labor, courier and print services. ", "In the consumer bank efficiencies category, savings have come through branch, staff and location efficiencies that we achieved via technological advancements and strategic investment in lower cost channels. This is a win-win as our clients value the enhanced conveniences, and adoption rates of the new technology have been high. Further, we garnered savings on our rewards check card program by renegotiating what we pay for the rewards and restructuring the rewards earnings rate. ", "Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings. We further reduced spend in layers in the organization and initiated Lean process design efforts to streamline key business processes, generate measurable savings and enhance client experiences. Furthermore, we made significant progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, reducing paper statements by hundreds of thousands. These items, coupled with the progress we made last year, put us in a good position relative to our stated expense savings goal. ", "Taking the broader view and looking over the longer term, we are acutely focused on improving our overall efficiency ratio. We've previously articulated our longer-term goal for a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit- and mortgage-related expenses, and that is what we're actively working toward. This program is the start and is providing the impetus for us to become a more efficiently run organization. ", "I'll conclude today with an overview of some changes that we've made to our segment reporting structure. You will recall that we previously reported results for 6 primary lines of business: Retail Banking, Diversified Commercial Banking, Corporate and Investment Banking, Wealth and Investment Management, Mortgage, and Commercial Real Estate, with the remainder in Corporate Other. Starting in 2012, our results are being reported via the 4 segments that you see here: Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, Wholesale Banking, Mortgage Banking and Corporate Other. ", "Mortgage and Corporate Other are largely unchanged, but there are notable changes in the other 2 segments. First, we formed Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management by combining our legacy Retail line of business with the private wealth portion of our former Wealth and Investment Management line of business. ", "Second, we created Wholesale Banking by combining our previous Corporate and Investment Banking, Diversified Commercial and CRE lines of business. Business Banking, our small business banking unit, which was previously included in Retail, is also now part of Wholesale. Additionally, the other major units of our former Wealth and Investment Management unit GenSpring, our family office, and RidgeWorth, our mutual fund complex, also roll up into the new Wholesale reporting segment.", "These changes were made in light of how our clients want to bank with us and how we manage our business. For example, when a business client has cash management, lending, real estate and capital markets needs, we serve this client by delivering SunTrust's full set of capabilities via our Wholesale Banking line of business, and this reporting structure facilitates that delivery approach. Similarly, when a consumer client has traditional banking and wealth management needs, our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management line of business is able to seamlessly offer these capabilities. ", "To best serve our client needs, we reorganized our management structure last year and appointed an executive to run each of our major segments. Brad Dinsmore is in charge of Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management. Mark Chancy runs Wholesale Banking, and Jerome Lienhard leads Mortgage Banking. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill to wrap us up before we go to Q&A.", "William Henry Rogers", "Okay, thanks, Aleem. Before we move on, let me briefly share with you a few comments about our business line performance to help reiterate the improvement we're seeing in our underlying core performance. ", "During the quarter, Consumer and Private Wealth Management completed our deposit transformation away from free checking. We retained 98% of our balances through this process, and the average deposit size of a new checking account is up almost 50% in our Everyday Checking product relative to what it was under free checking. Loyalty, as you might expect, took an early dip during the transition, but I'm pleased to say it has rebounded and it now exceeds where we were before the transformation and maybe most importantly, total deposits have continued the favorable trend. ", "Now another good sign of early recovery and our execution is evidenced in consumer lending overall, where production has been very strong. It's up 24% on a year-over-year basis, and that's totally organic, not from purchased assets. ", "Our Wholesale business continues to perform well. Net income is up 60% from the prior year. Our Corporate Investment Banking business continues to build momentum, and this unit posted its second-highest quarterly profit ever. C&I loan growth, overall, remains solid, though still more concentrated in larger corporate and middle market. Deposits are strong and the Wholesale line of business is generating positive operating leverage. ", "While we continue to manage through the legacy issues in Mortgage, origination activity was a bright spot this quarter. Production was up by 1/3 from the prior year, reaffirming our relationship-driven model. So our progress is steady. We're on the path to improved performance relative to our opportunity. ", "I'll wrap up my comments on the quarter. I'd characterize our results as a solid start to the year that built upon improved momentum that we established and generated last year. We benefited from the mortgage refinance tailwind this quarter, helping us overcome some of the fee income headwinds on the consumer side. More broadly, though, we see good underlying improving core performance in virtually all of our businesses. ", "So with that said, Kris, I'll turn it over to Q&A.", "Kristopher Dickson", "Right, Wendy, we're ready to begin the Q&A. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kevin Fitzsimmons from Sandler O'Neill.", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Was wondering, Mortgage was definitely the main bright spot this quarter. You mentioned it as a tailwind. Can you just give us a little sense for how to look at that going forward? I know the MBA forecast is for the refinancing to peak -- have peaked in fourth quarter and for that to flow through, but you also mentioned the HARP program. So just how should we think of that? Should we think of it as kind of falling off a little bit in the next few quarters, or does it remain at this level for a quarter or 2?", "William Henry Rogers", "Kevin, it's Bill. I'll take a crack at starting that, and it depends on a lot of variables. I mean, clearly, refinance -- I mean, we were -- 3/4 of our business was refinanced and 1/3 of that was HARP. So HARP was big for us. If you think about our markets, the amount of homes underwater, it\u2019s still a significant opportunity for us. So I think HARP as an individual unit probably has more legs than maybe we would have anticipated a quarter ago, and we got off to an early start at HARP. We have to eventually see some purchase volume, though, to sort of keep the momentum up. And while we see sort of glimpses of it and we'll see a week to week or slight improvement, it still is not the big driver, and refinance eventually runs its course. That being said, I think it probably has a few more legs than it did and we need to see that purchase volume. Does that make sense?", "Kevin Fitzsimmons - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Yes. Yes, it does. One quick follow-up. You mentioned early on in the call about the impact of the swaps rolling off, and I think you said that would be roughly a 10 basis point impact to the margin. Should we look at that as the total hit to the margin, or are there other offsets that could lessen that impact on the consolidated margin?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, that 10 basis point impact, Kevin, was just for the swaps alone. In addition to that, of course, we\u2019ve just got the regular overall drift of lower interest income and lower margins as a result of the interest rate environment we're in. So I think you'd already seen some of that happening around the industry this quarter and for the last several quarters. The 10 basis point will be in addition to what you're already assuming for us as lower margin and drift-down. Having said that, you see some of the actions that we've already taken and already been taking over the last year, to try and offset the impact of the rate environment. We're grinding down on deposit rates. We're looking at how we can manage our overall debt. One of the levers we have yet to pull is the ability to call our high-cost TruPs at some point. So all of those things will end up being offsets to the declining rate environment.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just staying on the theme of interest cost. I'm just curious, Aleem, where you think you might be able to get the deposit costs down to over the course of the next couple of quarters. It was 55 basis points in the first quarter, down about 4 basis points. I'm just curious as to how you were thinking about getting that number down over the next couple of quarters.", "Aleem Gillani", "Matt, that's a great question. If you'd asked me this a year ago, I would not have said we could get them down another 17 basis points in the next [indiscernible]. So rates have come down more than we expected. The ability to move rates down has been greater than we expected. And it looks like from what we can see, that we still have the ability to do more of that and more than I would have thought a few months or quarters ago. So we continue to test markets. We continue to see what we can do, how we can work with our clients to provide them the best product and service that we can at a fair rate and what the market is able to take. So I think you'll see us continue to work this down as much as we can over the course of the next several quarters in this rate environment.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then just following up on your comment on the TruPS, and I appreciate there's some timing issues with this. But in terms of the focus of what you could potentially repurchase over the course of this year, it looks like you've got one fixed rate issue and a couple of others -- couple of other smaller floating rate issues. I'm presuming that you're going to look first to repurchase the higher cost fixed rate TruPS, or is there something other than the regulatory call that prohibits you from doing that?", "Aleem Gillani", "No. We're primarily waiting on the regulatory issue, and you're aware that what we're waiting for here is for the Federal Reserve to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that formally designates TruPS as no longer qualifying as Tier 1 capital. And as soon as they do that, that's a change in the structure of the product for us and where -- we can then call them. The total amount of TruPS we've got outstanding is $1.9 billion. Of the $1.9 billion, about $700 million are floating rate and we may end up keeping those just as regular Tier 2 capital. There's $1.2 billion that's at a relatively higher rate. And actually both -- the $1.2 billion is composed of 2 issues, both of which are fixed rate. So it would be a reasonable assumption to make that we would focus on that $1.2 billion first.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Two questions, one on liquidity. Could you just give us a sense as to how you define your excess liquidity, and how much more you could shift into either securities or loans? I know it has a function of deposit growth, so assuming deposits are flat?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, we don't really think about liquidity as being excess liquidity. We don\u2019t always define liquidity as having -- from that perspective. As you know, Betsy, we've got a big store of liquidity in our securities portfolio. So we've got about $25 billion in our securities portfolio, $22 billion of which is composed basically of U.S. treasuries and agencies and agency MBS. That's a big store of liquidity. The way we think about it is our first call on liquidity is always client business. So we've got the store of liquidity always available in order to support any client requirements. That's number one. Second store of liquidity is in case we need it for liability management purposes. From that perspective, we've got lots of capacity, but we don't really think about liquidity from a sort of required and excess perspective.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then the follow-up is just on HARP 2. Could you just give us a sense of the potential HARPs that you think you have in your portfolio, and how much you've got done this quarter? If that rate change persisted, how many more quarters we could have HARP 2 impact your numbers?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. It's a -- there's a lot of capacity within the portfolio. So if you were just to sort of do that as analysis, you'd have a multi-quarter opportunity. But we do a lot of outreach. It's sort of hard to project and predict how a client will respond. We've been pretty happy with their response today. But if you just did a pure calculation, it's a multiple of what we did in this first quarter.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So it could take you through 2012 into 2013?", "William Henry Rogers", "Well, yes. I just want to be careful about sort of going through and saying we'd have this level of HARP all the way through 2012 to 2013, because we just sort of really have to anticipate will the program continue, how does it go and what client responses are. But as I said earlier, it has more running room than we thought initially, and the response has been very good and uniquely in our market there are a lot of -- unfortunately, a lot of opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "My first question is regard to the NII outlook again. I just want to get your thoughts about future loan growth and the pace of the growing areas. And can they kind of offset the runoff, and can loan growth offset -- or can earning asset growth offset the NIM compression as we look into the second half of the year from an NII perspective?", "Aleem Gillani", "That's a great question, Ken. When you look at the loan growth that we got over the last couple of years, I think it was very good and probably somewhat surprising in the context of the lack of economic growth that we saw throughout the country. So I think you can see over the last couple of years, we probably outperformed the average bank in terms of loan growth. We've built solid client-facing businesses. I think we're pretty close to our clients. We understand what their needs are. And if there is any type of economic recovery that's anything above sort of the anemic 1%, 2% GDP growth, we'll be there to capitalize on that. As you heard from our previous answer to Betsy, we've certainly got a store of liquidity available to support that loan growth. So we expect and we hope that in this part of the country where our footprint is, if there's any type of economic growth, we'll be able to leverage that and we'll be able to leverage that more positively than you've seen in the past.", "William Henry Rogers", "And maybe I'll add to that, just on the loan growth side. Our production numbers are good, so we're continuing to see positive increases in production. I talked about the consumer side being up 24% over last year. First quarter is always lower than the fourth quarter, but production is up. Pipelines in the commercial and large corporate side look good. But to Aleem's point, the real leverage is in utilization. Utilization is basically flat and has continued to be flat multi-quarter. Given sort of our concentration in this business, the nature of the type of commitments we make, the loyalty that we have from our client base, any economic recovery where utilization starts to increase, we get, I think, sort of a disproportionate impact of that on the positive side.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. My follow-up question is just related to PPG and the program outlook. You mentioned you're about 2/3 of the way through the annualized run rate. I'm just wondering if you can help us understand where that is showing up underneath it. It looked like salaries were still a little bit high. And how confident do you feel in obtaining, if not exceeding, the $300 million number given how close -- how far through you already are on the realization?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Ken, let me start that off, and Bill may kick me under the table here. I expect that we're going -- I'm very confident we're going to attain that number. And actually, I'm pretty confident we're going to exceed that number. The key with the PPG program is it was a good start to move us toward really thinking like a more efficient company. So the program in and of itself is important. We're very focused on it. We're going to make sure we hit and beat that target and probably earlier than we had anticipated when we kicked the program off. But the program itself is not the be-all and end-all of where we're going. Where we're really headed is to turn this company into a more efficient organization and try and hit that sub-60% efficiency ratio target. So this is a start for us. It's the impetus to get that thought process changed. So we'll hit this, and we'll beat it and we'll keep going. Did that get all your question?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein.", "Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Wondering if we could just dig a little bit more into the credit-related expenses, where you saw a nice sequential decline in the quarter. I know in the back half of '11, particularly on the operating losses, you were a little bit inflated with catch-up charges. Do you anticipate the credit-related expenses declining over the balance of the year? And if so, what do you consider a more normal range?", "Aleem Gillani", "Some of that decline this quarter, Kevin, was as a result of the inflated numbers you saw on the fourth quarter. You'll recall, fourth quarter of every year, there's a seasonal increase in costs, in credit and collections, for example, for taxes and that sort of thing. So some of the decline this quarter was just as a result of reversing that. However, having said that, we're very, very focused on this number. You know we are. And we're going to be continuing to try and push this number lower year-over-year, maybe not quarter-over-quarter but year-over-year from what you see.", "Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Great. And then on the mortgage repurchase provisions. In the K, you've put a range of between 0 and $700 million in terms of remaining accruals. Are you still comfortable with that range? And can we assume now that we're talking about 0 and $525 million?", "Aleem Gillani", "We're still comfortable with the overall range. I don't know that we're going to get an exact dollar-for-dollar match. But I think what you'll see is something that's directionally correct, and that overall range generally will continue to hold.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brian Foran with Nomura.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I guess just following along the lines of the cost-save program when we try to benchmark how much opportunity is left kind of on the face of the income statement. So you talk about getting the core efficiency ratio sub-60% adjusted for all the credit-related items. Can you just give us what you peg that number at in the current quarter, just given there's enough moving parts that I can imagine different people would come up with different numbers?", "Aleem Gillani", "There were a lot of moving parts, Brian. Here's a way to maybe think about it. When you look at Q4 versus Q1, our overall noninterest expenses were down $120 million. One way to think about that is that $120 million was really all the reduction of the fourth quarter accrual for mortgage servicing litigation. So that brings us about flat. Within that flat, Q4 to Q1, there were lots of puts and takes. Generally, here's the high-level numbers of what we saw Q4 to Q1. Employee comp and benefits was up about $170 million, as I said. The pieces that went into that $170 million were the low pension number in the fourth quarter as a result of the curtailment, the reduction in other incentive plans we put in place in the fourth quarter and the Q1 seasonal increase in FICA and employee benefits. So those are, basically, the components of the $170 million increase. And that $170 million was basically offset by reductions in marketing, in operating losses, litigation accruals, in FDIC premium and in those credit and collection costs and other noninterest expenses, like legal and consulting, lower PPG severance, et cetera. So net-net, down $120 million but with a lot of puts and takes. Having said that, most of those puts and takes were really a Q4 noise, not Q1 noise. As I think about Q1, it was a relative -- it was a very clean noiseless quarter, and most of the differences were really Q4 items from last year.", "William Henry Rogers", "And I'll just maybe add a little bit. And I know it's frustrating because we talk in terms of run rate. And we want to see it in every quarter and it just sort of doesn't have that perfect match. But we're confident in the things that we're putting in place that permanently get that run rate down. And you look sort of -- to some examples and maybe the other I'd give you is full-time equivalents were down 300 last quarter and down another 500 this quarter. And that's clearly another leading indicator of where you look at from a -- or what you need to look at from the expense side.", "Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And then just one other follow-up. I mean, I guess the mortgage banking improvement in the revenue trends quarter-over-quarter, as well as -- I'm assuming relative to your expectations, what would be the kind of expense offset we should pencil into that just as we try to figure out that a couple more good quarters from HARP, eventually, that's going to normalize. And I'm assuming, at least some of the, maybe, expense disappointment that investors feel this quarter might come from the mortgage upside, but I'm not sure if that's the case.", "Aleem Gillani", "So some of it clearly does. Incentive expenses will all go up as a result of the increased production. However, keep in mind, there's a little bit of a timing difference between when we recognize income unlock and when we pay incentive expense on close. So some of the revenue from this quarter, the incentive cost for that will actually show up 60 days out or so when we pay that out on close.", "William Henry Rogers", "But the answer overall to your assumption is correct, is that the bulk -- other than sort of normal kind of merit increases, again, offset by sort of total reduction in FTEs, is primarily centered in the things that are driving revenue. So think mortgage, think Investment Banking revenue, the things that we're accruing relative to where we see the opportunity. And on mortgage, part of the offset of that also is just -- I think HARP 2 is a much more efficient loan done through a much more efficient channel. So it, over time, has a different efficiency dynamic and return dynamic than a traditional refinance or certainly a purchase loan.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "First, just on the home equity book. Didn't look like there was any real impact from the kind of new change or the guidance valuation methodology put in place in January. But is there any expected future impact from this or in terms of changes in NPA balances or provisioning?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I guess that depends on whether we're asked to make the changes that, apparently, some of the money centers were asked to do. It looks like from what the announcements we saw over the last week or so, Craig, that money centers were asked to make this change but regional banks generally weren't. But having said that, let me sort of lead you through how we're looking at this now. So we've got a $15 billion home equity book. About 1/3 of that book are actually firsts, not seconds. Of the remainder, about 1/3 of those, we already service the firsts. So we can see what's going on in the first and we have a good sense of what's going on in that book. Of the remainder where there are seconds and we don't service the firsts, we actually do a FICO refresh every quarter. And if the first does go delinquent, you know it has an immediate impact on FICO, and we're able to see that immediate impact and adjust. So our reserving methodology already takes that into account. Where we can see that happen, we built that into our reserving methodology. Therefore, if we are ever requested to put a required -- to put what are currently performing loans into a nonperforming category, we actually don't expect that the income statement impact would be material for us.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So if we think about your home equity book, out of the 2/3 that are seconds, 1/3 of that, you already service the firsts. So effectively, it's the same valuation methodology the money center\u2019s using now. And out of 2/3 of the 2/3, you refresh the FICO so the delta would be modest, if anything.", "Aleem Gillani", "That's exactly right.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up question. In your 10-K, you gave an upper limit to mortgage repurchase provisions of $700 million. Given that you had $175 million this quarter, is the kind of updated upper limit now effectively $525 million?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Craig, as I said earlier, I don't think it's going to be an exact dollar-for-dollar match every quarter. But directionally, we expect when we file our K and we update that range, it'll be directionally correct.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one other follow-up on the HARP stuff. Where are you in terms of the capacity to increase production at this point? And are you actually refi-ing just out of your own servicing portfolio, or are you looking outside?", "Aleem Gillani", "We're primarily within our own portfolio. And as I said earlier, I mean, the runway within our own portfolio is pretty long. And given sort of our capacity and our portfolio, and quite frankly, the desire to serve our clients and we're reaching out very specifically, I don't see that changing short term. I think we've got plenty of runway there. And using our capacity, I think we'll stay with our portfolio here in the short term.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just on utilization. You talked about this being flat for multiple quarters. Are you seeing actually higher commitments? So is it more you just not seeing a ramp-up in utilization on the part of your borrowers?", "Aleem Gillani", "We're continuing to increase commitments. I mean, as we grow our business and add relationships, our commitments are continuing to go up. But we're just not seeing the utilization firm. So if you look multi-quarter over the last 3 or 4 quarters, we sort of have a continual, steady increase in commitments.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Greg Ketron with UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Question on Mortgage. It looks like your application volume's up about 30% over the last quarter. And just a couple of points there that I was looking at. One, it looks like your correspondent volumes picked up, and we know some people have downsized their correspondent business. So I guess one question would be the market share that you sense that you're picking up, and then two would be the production spreads that you're seeing in this current pipeline compared to what we saw in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry in the \u2013 yes, in the fourth quarter that may -- or first quarter that may carry on to the second quarter.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. Greg, I'll take a crack at both those. Correspondent was up, and you know what's going on in the industry. But that being said, our retail was also up and clear focus on our clients and clear focus on HARP. Could correspondent be up more if we didn't have HARP 2.0? Probably, but we're trying to manage that fairly tightly and keep a focus on our clients and on HARP as using up a good portion of our capacity. On the spread standpoint, spreads were better. I mean, we know everybody's talked about that and that's the case. Spreads were better in the first quarter. Would they come in slightly over the second quarter? I would anticipate they would because they were at universally abnormally high in the first quarter, and I don't imagine over time that's sustainable. So they'll come back at -- to a more normalized level over the next couple of quarters.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And one maybe bigger-picture question in terms of loan growth and deposit growth. And you guys are growing the balance sheet in these areas at rates that we haven't seen in a while, and the industry is experiencing a much faster growth rate. But do you sense that you're gaining market share? And if so, the strategy or what are the sources of that -- of the market share gains?", "William Henry Rogers", "Well, you can look at the things you look at. So we talked about, in the fourth quarter, where we looked at FDIC data and from the deposit side and clearly looked at 8 of the 10 largest markets we had. You couldn't come up with the conclusion other than we've gained market share, I think, I mean, from that data. As it relates to loans, you just look at sort of the fed data and sort of industry growth and how we look relative to that. And I\u2019d have to come up with a sort of a similar conclusion that there's some gain in share. Where that comes from specifically? I'd say everywhere. I mean, it starts up -- there's a lot of disruption and things that are going on in our market that we all know about. On the small side, we've had, gosh, I think, 140 bank failures in Georgia and Florida since the beginning of this. So we're seeing reduced competition from that standpoint. So I don't think, Greg, it's any one place. I just think it's just good, raw execution everywhere for us and picking up incrementally every opportunity that we have.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And that's something you feel that's sustainable as we look forward?", "William Henry Rogers", "We've been on a good path. And I think as we continue to not only gain marginal share and probably more important is share of wallet, and I think that's where our big opportunity is, so not only within the market, but even within our own client base, we're really putting a lot of efforts to gain that share through share of wallet. Yes, let me just take a minute to wrap up the call and just make a couple of comments. I hope that you've been able to conclude that momentum and intensity are building here at SunTrust as we continue to progress against our game plan to significantly improve our performance. We've seen evidence of this in our core performance coming out of last year and very positively continue in the first quarter. I believe we've prioritized appropriately. We're focused in areas that can best impact our future performance, and we very much look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Kris Dickson, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Kris Dickson", "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to SunTrust's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us today.", "In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements.

We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance.

In our normal fashion, I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on our performance this quarter and then pass on to Aleem to provide details on the results. The high-level points are shown on Slide 3 of our presentation.", "Core performance continued to steadily improve this quarter. Net income to common shareholders was $270 million, and earnings per share was $0.50, a $0.04 increase over last quarter and a $0.17 increase over last year.", "On the revenue side, total revenue was up $28 million over last quarter, driven by higher noninterest income. Strong Mortgage revenue drove a $64 million or 7% sequential quarter increase in fee income, while our net interest income declined $36 million due to decrease in swap income.", "Mortgage production volume remained high this quarter. To date this year, we've closed almost $16 billion in Mortgage loans, up over 50% from last year, which helped over 62,000 clients buy or refinance a home this year, including many through the HARP program.", "Now moving to expenses. They were stable the last quarter and last year. Included in this quarter's expense was a $13 million noncash charge associated with redemption of a $1.2 billion of trust preferred securities. These were higher-cost fundings, and as such, we moved quickly to redeem them once the capital treatment of that occurred, allowing us to do so.", "We've made significant progress in our efforts to reduce expenses through our PPG program. To date, we've generated annualized savings of $250 million, and we're now well within our sight of $300 million goal for the program.", "Now at the risk of being redundant, I'll reiterate that we're committed to establishing a more efficiently-run organization. The PPG program was the catalyst, but was never intended to be the final goal for us. So what I'm saying here is that when PPG is done, our work is not. The ultimate objective is getting our efficiency ratio under 60%, and we have high intensity around both revenue and expense initiatives to help us achieve that goal.", "Now taking a look at the balance sheet. Targeted loan growth, particularly in C&I, drove a $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and nearly a $10 billion increase over last year. At the same time, we've been actively managing down certain real estate-related loan balances.", "Though average client deposits were stable to last quarter's record level, we continue to see the favorable mix shift this quarter. Average DDA balances were up 3% from the prior quarter and 23% from the prior year, while CD balances declined.", "Credit quality also continued to improve across-the-board. Net charge-offs are 1.14% of average loans, down 17% from the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were down 7%, and early-stage delinquencies declined 7 basis points. Lastly, we generated additional positive capital growth with Tier 1 common ratio estimated at 9.4% at quarter end.", "Now before I wrap up my comments and turn it over to Aleem, I'm going to take a minute to address our resubmitted capital plan under the 2012 CCAR process. As you're aware, we submitted our revised capital plan in mid-June. While the fed is in the process of reviewing our plan, I wanted to share with you in advance that we elected not to request any increase in the current level of the dividend or any other return of capital at this time. We made this decision in light of the fact that this submission only covered capital actions for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013.", "Additionally, we considered the close proximity of the resubmission to the 2013 CCAR process, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, shortly after the time we expect to hear back on this plan. And we think this is the best course of action for the short term, but it's not indicative of our long-term plans to return capital prudently to shareholders.", "As a reminder, in their review of our original plan submission, the fed did not object to the trust preferred redemptions, which, as I noted earlier, have been completed, or to maintaining the quarterly common stock dividend at $0.05 a share. The 2013 CCAR process will begin later this year, will provide us an opportunity to evaluate capital deployment alternatives for next year.", "So overall, we made continued progress this quarter with momentum building in several key areas of our company. Of note was the solid noninterest income growth, mainly driven by strong Mortgage production, though with a pick up in several other fee categories as well. We also saw a continuation of a multi-quarter trend in increased performing loan balances, particularly in our C&I book. So looking ahead, challenges remain with the less-than-ideal operating environment, but I believe SunTrust is well-positioned to capitalize upon our opportunities.", "And with that said, let me turn it over to Aleem.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4. Bill had a lot of the highlights, so I'll be brief here and then we'll delve deeper on subsequent slides.", "As Bill noted earlier, we're pleased to report higher earnings per share this quarter of $0.50, which is a $0.04 increase from the prior quarter and a $0.17 increase from last year. This sequential quarter income growth is attributable to higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision. Revenue grew $28 million, as higher noninterest income more than offset the swap-related decline in net interest income. Provision declined $17 million due to lower net charge-offs and continued improvements in other credit metrics.", "Higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision also drove the growth from the second quarter of last year, where revenue increased by $48 million by a combination of higher net interest income and higher fee income, the latter of which was primarily mortgage-related. Improvements in credit quality were widespread, driving a $92 million decline in the provision, while noninterest expense was essentially unchanged.", "Year-to-date EPS was $0.96. This is more than double the $0.41 reported during the first 6 months of last year. Revenue was higher, up 2% on a reported basis but by a more meaningful 5% net of the usual quarterly adjustment items we detail in the appendix. Other drivers were a lower loan loss provision and the redemption of the capital purchase program preferred shares.", "Let's take a look at each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined by $36 million or 3%, and the net interest margin fell by 10 basis points to 3.39%. Both of these declines were almost entirely due to the previously disclosed reduction in income for maturing commercial loan swaps. Excluding the impact of the swap, net interest income and margin were relatively stable as lower loan yields and a smaller securities portfolio were offset by the benefits of higher loan balances and an improved deposit mix.", "Despite lower swap income, net interest income increased from the prior year by $20 million or 2%. Interest income declined by $49 million as lower asset yield outweighed the favorable impact of higher loan balances. However, this was more than offset by a $69 million decline in interest expense, driven by favorable liability trends, including strong DDA growth, a 17 basis point reduction in deposit rates paid and a 65 basis point decline in long-term debt costs.", "I'll spend a few minutes discussing some of the major drivers of future net interest income and margin. First, on the asset side. With a slightly improving economy, we expect to see continued loan growth, which would be additive to net interest income. Although as you're well aware, most going-on rates are lower than the portfolio's current yield. Our securities balances declined somewhat this quarter, as we didn't see many attractive alternatives in light of the continued decline in yields. But we'll continue to monitor the market, and we'll pick our spots to reinvest. Commercial loan swap income is expected to stay relatively stable through the next year at its current level of about $120 million per quarter, assuming no major changes to LIBOR.", "Turning to the liability side. During the third quarter, we'll begin to benefit from last week's redemption of $1.2 billion in higher-cost trust-preferred securities, which had a weighted average cost of about 7%. Deposit pricing opportunities are obviously becoming limited at this point, given their low absolute rates, but this is something that we do continue to evaluate and manage carefully. We'll also benefit from higher-cost CDs maturing and rolling into lower rate products.", "So all told, there are headwinds and tailwinds. As we look specifically to the third quarter, we expect those headwinds and tailwinds to largely offset one another, such that the net interest margin is relatively stable.", "Look at noninterest income on Slide 6. Second quarter noninterest income was $940 million, a sequential quarter increase of $64 million on a reported basis or $39 million net of the adjustment items we detail in the appendix. Mortgage production income was strong this quarter, as origination volumes and gains on sale remained high.", "During the quarter, we closed over $8.2 billion of loans, which was up 8%. Purchase volume was $3 billion, an increase of over $1 billion. Refinance volume declined modestly, but remained healthy at $5.2 billion. Mortgage production income was $103 million this quarter or $258 million exclusive of the mortgage repurchase provision. Sequential quarter growth and the reported figure was $40 million, $20 million of which was attributable to a lower repurchase provision and $18 million due to a gain in conjunction with the sale of a portfolio containing government-guaranteed mortgages. And I'll discuss both of those in more detail on subsequent slides.", "In addition to the increase in mortgage production, we saw growth in numerous other consumer and commercial fee categories. As a couple of examples, loan commitment fees, recorded in the other charges and fees line item, were strong, and card fees grew due to increased client usage. Relative to the prior year, noninterest income was up $28 million on a reported basis and $59 million or 7% on an adjusted basis.", "The largest driver of the adjusted fee growth was a $99 million increase in mortgage production, with core mortgage production income up $164 million, partially offset by a $65 million increase in the repurchase provision. Trading income was also a driver of the year-over-year growth due to improved market conditions. On the flip side, card fees declined due to the implementation of caps on debit interchange income. We also saw a decline in investment banking income on lower syndicated finance volume.", "Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of this quarter's trends in mortgage repurchases. Mortgage repurchase demands, shown in the top-left box, were $489 million this quarter. That's an increase of about $40 million from last quarter, but within our range of expectations and well below the elevated levels we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Demands continue to be concentrated in the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for roughly 90% of all demand activity over the past several years, as well as this quarter. While demand levels may remain elevated in the coming quarters, consistent with what we've expressed for several quarters now, the underlying trends in demands and full file requests continue to suggest to us that the agencies are making progress in working through these higher-loss content vintages. For example, full file request volume has moderated somewhat and continue to transition toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure.", "Pending population, shown in the top-right portion of this slide, increased to $652 million, up roughly $90 million from the prior quarter. This was the result of the increase in new demands, as well as a slower rate of demand resolution. We're taking a deliberate approach to the demand review process, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate, yet cure or moderate losses wherever possible.", "Mortgage repurchase reserve, shown at the bottom left of the page, increased to $434 million, up $51 million from the first quarter. The increase relates primarily to the higher level of the pending population. Said differently, the reserve increase is in part due to the higher level of demands and, in part, to a reduction in charge-offs, which is merely a function of loss recognition timing.", "Similar to prior quarters, some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed at the bottom right of this page, and we've also provided some additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages in the appendix.", "Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain generally unchanged from what we've shared with you in recent quarters. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if recent patterns and full file requests continue as anticipated, we expect to see a reduced income statement impact towards the end of this year.", "Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. Expenses were essentially stable compared to both the prior quarter and prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, employee compensation and benefits declined by $35 million due to the seasonal reduction in benefits. This decline was offset by growth in a handful of other categories. Bill mentioned earlier the $13 million noncash charge that we incurred related to the redemption of trust preferred securities.", "Additionally, operating losses increased $9 million due to specific mortgage-related losses and legal accruals. FDIC premiums increased $8 million. This line item was a bit lower than normal in the first quarter, and the Q2 level is expected to be a more normal run rate. In credit-related expenses, which we detailed for you, as usual, in the appendix, increased by $7 million.", "I will point out that this quarter, we refined our methodology for recognizing tax payments on delinquent loans, which resulted in an approximate $10 million increase in credit and collection expenses. As a result of this change, we should not experience the seasonal fourth quarter spike in this line item that we've seen in prior years.", "Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $11 million, driven by lower FDIC premiums, credit-related expenses and marketing costs. These declines were partially offset by a modest increase in compensation and higher outside processing costs.", "Before we turn to the balance sheet starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize this quarter's income statement by noting that we drove continued improvement in our core earnings this quarter. Obviously, our low -- our absolute level of profitability is still well below our profit-generation capability. But overall, we were pleased to note continued progression toward a more normalized level of earnings.", "Average performing loans increased again this quarter, up sequentially by a little over $1 billion or about 1%. Growth was driven by commercial loans, specifically C&I, which was up $1.3 billion.", "Within our Wholesale businesses, growth continued to be concentrated in larger corporate clients and to be well diversified. Specific industry verticals within our Corporate Investment Bank that drove the bulk of this quarter's growth were healthcare, diversified, financial services and media.", "We also booked some modest growth in our Diversified Commercial Banking business, driven by auto dealers and not-for-profit clients. While we saw a continued runoff of legacy assets in our commercial real estate book, the pace of decline moderated again this quarter.", "The residential portfolio was relatively stable this quarter. Within it, we grew non-guaranteed loans by about $700 million, driven by high FICO jumbo loans. The guaranteed portfolio was down approximately $600 million, largely due to the sale of $0.5 billion in loans this quarter.", "Relative to the prior year, performing loans grew almost $10 billion or 9%, with the growth coming entirely from our targeted categories, namely C&I, guaranteed mortgages and consumer loans. C&I led the way, up $5.6 billion or 12%, driven by large corporate and middle market borrowers. Consumer loans increased almost $4 billion or 24%, with growth across all loan categories, most notably student loans.", "And government-guaranteed mortgages were up $1.5 billion or about 33%. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in certain portfolios, including CRE, construction and home equity, which were managed down by a combined $2.3 billion.", "The continued impact of this derisking is evident on Slide 10. Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $14 billion or 60% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter.", "Higher-risk balances were managed down by over $2 billion or 18% from the prior year, with the decline split relatively evenly between the 3 major categories. This can be seen at the bottom of the page. The overall decline and the higher risk balances over the past few years has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans. This combination has helped to significantly improve the risk profile of the company in a relatively short period of time.", "Additionally, the increases in government-guaranteed balances also served as a bridge to a time of organic loan growth. Recent quarters' higher-risk loan balances have declined at a slower pace in light of the smaller size of this portfolio and its improving risk characteristics.", "Additionally, we've seen a pickup in organic loan demand. As such, and as part of our continued active management of the balance sheet, we elected to sell about $0.5 billion of government-guaranteed mortgages this quarter, and this resulted in an $18 million gain.", "Let's turn to Slide 11 for a review of credit trends. Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 8 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans. Non-guaranteed mortgage delinquency rates declined by 23 basis points, and home equity improved by 11 basis points.", "Nonperforming loans declined sequentially by almost $200 million or 7%. Improvements were evident across the portfolio, most notably in commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction. Nonperforming assets declined by over $300 million or 11%, driven by the decline in nonperforming loans, as well as reductions in other real estate owned and the completion of the sale of the nonperforming mortgage loans that we commenced last quarter. Year-over-year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or more than 30%. All loan categories showed improvement, with the highest declines coming from commercial construction, CRE and C&I.", "Net charge-offs declined by $72 million or 17% sequentially, and the net charge-off ratio fell by 24 basis points to 1.14%. Non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and commercial real estate were the biggest drivers of the improvement. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by $155 million, or about 30%, with meaningful improvements seen across most of the portfolios.", "The allowance for loan and lease losses was $2.3 billion at quarter end or 1.86% of loans. In light of the continued favorable trends in credit quality, the allowance declined this quarter, albeit at a more modest pace than recent quarters. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the allowance calculation, the ratio stood at 2.07%.", "Overall, we were pleased with our trends in credit metrics, and the improvements exceeded our expectations, particularly in net charge-offs. As we look forward, a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends with improvements primarily driven by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are currently nearing more normal credit metric levels. Looking specifically at the third quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable net charge-offs.", "Let's take a look at deposit performance. Average deposit balances were stable with their record first quarter level of approximately $126 billion. A favorable shift in deposit mix continued as DDA and savings increased while higher-cost time deposits declined. Compared to last year, client deposits were up $4 billion or 3%. Lower-cost deposits drove the increase, with DDA up almost $7 billion or 23%. Conversely, time deposits were down almost $3 billion or 14%. This favorable mix shift has contributed to our year-over-year net interest income growth.", "Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common increased for the eighth consecutive quarter, up sequentially by approximately $300 million, primarily from increased retained earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.4%, up another 7 basis points from last quarter's 9.33%.", "While not shown on this slide, I'll mention the capital impact of our decision to call the $1.2 billion of higher-cost trust-preferred securities. The redemption of these securities resulted in a reduction of our Basel I Tier 1 ratio of about 90 basis points, and that impact is already reflected in our second quarter capital ratio estimates. As you're aware, this will not impact our fully phased-in Basel III Tier 1 ratio as trust preferreds are not Tier 1 qualifying instruments.", "As it relates to our recent Basel III notice of proposed rulemaking, we continue to evaluate the potential impact to our capital ratios. Under this proposal, we expect to see some increase in risk-weighted assets and a corresponding decrease in capital ratios, primarily due to the ranges of risk weightings for residential mortgages and home equity. If implemented, as stated in the recent NPR, our resulting capital ratios should still comfortably exceed all proposed regulatory requirements.", "Bottom part of this slide shows our tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share. Both were up this quarter due to increases in retained earnings and other comprehensive income. Tangible common equity ratio increased by 17 basis points to 8.15%, while our tangible book value per share climbed about 2% to end the quarter just above $26.", "Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense program. As you can see, we made continued progress against the $300 million expense savings goal for the PPG program. To date, we've reached $250 million in annualized savings.", "As you know, this program is comprised of numerous expense savings initiatives broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, Consumer Bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. This quarter, we garnered savings in each of these categories. And on the slide, you can see the activities that were the primary drivers of the savings.", "In our strategic supply management initiatives, we achieved additional savings through further contract renegotiations. Additionally, we have successfully managed down our own spending on items we consider discretionary, items such as travel, temp labor, print and wireless service. Our teammates are finding ways everyday to cut out expenses for things that once seemed like a necessity. There's a high level of commitment here throughout the company, and this is something every teammate can do to improve efficiency and meet our goals.", "In the Consumer Bank efficiencies category, we've achieved savings primarily due to 2 key initiatives. First, we revamped our branch staffing model to better align market needs with staff, from both a capabilities and a volume perspective. We're achieving greater efficiencies by differentiating staffing by client segment served and market opportunity. Furthermore, we've changed our incentive compensation structure for certain types of positions, and this is now yielding real dollar savings.", "Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings, though the chief component of our savings this quarter came from tighter spans and layers with further reductions in FTEs. We also made additional progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, making significant reductions in the number of paper statements that we now process.", "Though we are rapidly approaching our goal of $300 million in savings, as Bill mentioned earlier, this, by no means, should imply that we are done with our work here. PPG was the beginning of a process of transformation of SunTrust. We will continue to leverage the strong momentum we have generated to drive toward our ultimate goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit and mortgage-related expenses. PPG program is only the start of our efficiency improvement efforts.", "That wraps up my comments for today. So I'll call -- I'll turn the call back over to Bill.", "William Henry Rogers", "Okay. Thanks, Aleem. And before we move into Q&A, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some of the progress we've been making in our lines of business. These results punctuate the core momentum we're building.", "I'll start by noting that the efficiency ratio is down at each of the lines of business relative to last quarter and last year. Of course, their absolute levels are too high, but each business has specific plans that aimed at driving continued improvements.", "In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth line of business, we generated solid DDA growth of 11%, and loan production volume was up a healthy 19% during the first half of the year. From a revenue perspective -- I mean, regulatory headwinds continued to challenge noninterest income in this business. However, you'll notice that expenses were down 7% from the second quarter of last year, due in large part to reductions in staffing driven by our PPG initiatives, which Aleem highlighted.", "Another encouraging statistic is that client loyalty continued to increase in our retail business this quarter, solidifying our position as an industry-leading bank and our footprint for this metric. Also of note here is our credit card business. Our relaunch of this business is in its early stages, but it's going well thus far, with new account sales more than 4x the levels generated in the second quarter of last year.", "We've been delivering strong results in our Wholesale business. Year-to-date net income was nearly double what it was a year ago. We saw a record net income and revenue in Corporate, Investment Banking, and it generated the lion's share of the 8% Wholesale loan growth over last year. DDA balances were up over 20%, driven by our Diversified Commercial Banking business.", "We're also beginning to generate some core commercial real estate growth. Like credit card, we're in the early stages here, but we're pleased with our progress and believe commercial real estate loan balances are nearing an inflection point where we'll start to see some growth in this portfolio in coming quarters.", "We're also seeing improving trends in our Mortgage line of business. Year-to-date, Mortgage production volume was up $5.5 billion or over 50%, and core Mortgage production income was $320 million higher. The overall profitability of our Mortgage business continues to be negatively impacted by legacy issues and still operating a net loss position this quarter, but the trends are improving. Given the current rate environment and some overall improvements in the housing market, coupled with the HARP pipeline, we expect to have near-term Mortgage production revenue to remain strong.", "So overall, line of business performance is trending positively, and we're seeing the results more clearly in the company's financial metrics. Our SunTrust team is working hard in delivering better results, and I'd be remiss in not recognizing them and thanking them for their collective effort.", "So with that said, Kris, let me turn it back over to you.", "Kris Dickson", "Candy, we're ready to start the Q&A. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Pancari, Evercore Partners.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Can you give us some more color around your decision to not request deployment as part of the CCAR resubmission? I mean, was it influenced by the Basel III NPR? I know you didn't give us the basis point impact, but that would be helpful as well on Tier 1 common.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. John, it's Bill. I'll take the first crack at that. First of all, it was not influenced by the -- by Basel III. I think sort of in its simplest form, I mean, the resubmission gave us 2 more quarters of better performance. Waiting until 2013 gives us 4 quarters of continued performance, and you've seen we're on the steady trend. That might ought to give some indication of our confidence. So it was more just continuing to wait for the company's performance to improve, both on the income side and the credit metric side, not actually more complicated than that.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So do you have what the basis point impact from the Basel III NPR changes...?", "William Henry Rogers", "I'll let Aleem take a swing at that.", "Aleem Gillani", "John, let me take a crack at that. First of all, I think we -- I've got to say, we were pleased to see the NPR. Having that out I think is going to provide more clarity to the industry as to what the capital -- expected capital ratios are going to look like going forward. Having said that, parts of the NPR, I think, came as a little bit of a surprise. On the numerator side, it came out pretty well, as much as the industry expected. But on the denominator side, some of the changes to RWA, for example, were not expected and aren't, actually, part of the Basel proposal. These are U.S. regulatory proposals. We are, along with the rest of the industry, responding to that proposal now, and I think the industry has a deadline of sometime in September to respond back to that. At that point, the regulators will take a look at all of the response letters and come out with final rules at some point, probably next year. As we try to estimate what we might look like under this proposal, I think you've seen a lot of banks over the last few days estimate that their final numbers are in -- are going to be in that 8% range, using these proposals on our current portfolios and prior to any management mitigation. And I think it'd be fair, as you look at our portfolio, to say we'll come in around that same kind of level as most other banks are estimating.", "Operator", "Next question is from Josh Levin, Citigroup.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "So given how challenging the rate environment is for all the banks, one of your peers yesterday said it was going to close up to 5% of its branches. As you think about the environment, rates and regulatory costs and how you want to drive costs down, are you considering branch closings or some kind of infrastructure reduction in order to save costs?", "William Henry Rogers", "I think I'd put it more in the category of just general efficiencies. And particularly in the Consumer Banking area, I mean, if you look at what we've done, expenses being down 7% there, that's a combination of just being efficient. Clearly, transaction volume in branches are down. I mean, nobody is sort of missing that. I'm a believer in that -- that branch is a sales center, as much as it is a service center. So physically having people there on the sales side is a benefit. Whether we close a few branches or open a few branches, I mean, we'll sort of be netting around that number. We'll look at that as a consideration long term. But the real efficiency just is in what we do within the branches, and you're already starting to see that from us. I mean, I think we're sort of ahead of the game on that front.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Some of your peers have suggested that over the last few weeks, given the macro uncertainty, customers are becoming a bit more reticent about investing in their businesses. Are you hearing that or sensing that from your customers when you're out in the field?", "William Henry Rogers", "It's sort of a tale of 2 cities. I mean, you see what's going on with our loan growth, particularly on the upper-end side. Our pipelines on the commercial side are actually quite strong and ahead of where they were significantly this time last year. But if you're out there, and I'm out there a lot, and you talk to primarily sort of on the small business side, yes, I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the -- all the things that would cause that uncertainty, from fiscal cliff to tax to healthcare to all the things that they're concerned about, and you see it in the cash build-up. But having despite all that, we're still seeing some good loan growth.", "Operator", "Next question is from Chris Mutascio, Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Aleem, if you can walk me through something, I would appreciate it. On Slide 14, you talked about the cost saves that you've realized, about $250 million of the $300 million that you've planned for. But then I go to Slide 26 in the presentation and look at your own adjusted core noninterest expense, and on a year-over-year basis, you're only down $10 million. So I would've expected that quarterly number to be down more like $60 million or 1/4 of the $250 million of savings that you've gotten already. So I guess my question is, where are the cost saves coming?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, Chris, let me help you a little bit with that. There have been cost saves pretty well across-the-board. There've been cost saves, for example, in compensation. There've been cost saves in areas -- discretionary expenses. And as you go down our income statement, those cost saves have showed up pretty well all the way down the line, however, some of those have been offset by cost increases in some other areas. For example, our -- we've got some consulting costs for now that have come in as a result of the mortgage foreclosure review that were not originally anticipated. So you'll see some of those in there. And you'll see some compensation increases as a result of increased revenue. And so just as a result of revenue-related compensation increases, we've got some increases there. And so that's why, overall, you see a netting, but that netting is -- I would consider that to be a really good trade, in that we're paying people commissions on revenue they're generating, while at the same time, we're reducing core costs.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. I mean, if you put some -- this is Bill. If you put some numbers around that, just think of the 2 businesses that are most highly correlated to compensation, in Mortgage and CIB, and over a year-over-year comparison, they're up about $350 million in revenue and about $50 million in comp. Well, I think that's a pretty good trade-off. Similarly, our core revenue is up about 5%, and core expenses are up about 1.5%. So that -- those are driving us towards that lower efficiency ratio. Do we want it to be faster? Are we still frustrated by our level of expenses? Absolutely. It won't be an excuse-making category. But some of these trade-offs, as it relates to revenue and comp, I think, are worth making.", "Operator", "And next question is from Jefferson Harralson, KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to possibly discuss this 60% efficiency ratio goal and what needs to happen to get there. So you assume the rest of PPG assume all of credit and collections. Do you need some -- or some percentage of credit and collections and credit-related expenses? And do you need to have a better margin or a better operating environment or higher rates to get all the way to the 60s?", "William Henry Rogers", "Jefferson, this is Bill. Let me take it really high level, and then we can just let it go down any tributary you want to go down it. And this is the way that I like to think about it, just because it sort of makes it easy and it doesn't make it sort of dependent upon a bunch of exogenous factors. If you normalize a number of facts -- so let's assume sort of a flat revenue environment. Let's assume we actually don't get another penny's worth of revenue. If you normalize for a net charge-off/provision at some basis, so normalize it wherever you want to, but call it 50 to 70 basis points, which is clearly higher than we've trended in the past. If you normalize for FIN 45, mortgage repurchase and just put some number in there, pick a number, but it's -- it would be appreciably smaller than where it is today. Then you normalize for the credit-related expenses, so there, they've run about $800 million, sort of annualized a little higher, now they're running closer to $700 million annualized, and we're starting to see that benefit. It used to be about $200 million. I don't think we'll get to there. So pick a number, just cut it in half as a thought process and then put $300 million in PPG on top of that and you get to, at that point, essentially a 60% efficiency ratio and a 1% plus ROA. So at a really high level, I mean, that sort of what gives us confidence. Now it won't work out that way exactly, and there'll be puts and takes. And the timing will be different, and one quarter will be up, one quarter will be down. But if you think about that in sort of a goal, that's it. Now to the point of PPG, if some of those things don't materialize, if the credit expenses don't come down like that or if the charge-offs don't normalize the way I've described or, in fact, if revenue is down for some reason unforeseen, then the number on the savings will be higher. I mean, that's how I like to think about it, just sort of about a really, really high level. Does that make sense?", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "It does. It does.", "Operator", "And next question is from Paul Miller, FDR.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "On Slide 7 of the mortgage repurchase trends, you -- I love this detail, by the way, guys, best detail out there. There was a particular company yesterday at one of your competitors that said that they felt that repurchase claims would increase by the end of the year from discussions with the GSEs, that they were going to get requests from every loan that has defaulted that they sold to them over the '05-'09 time period. I know you took a big charge-back in the fourth quarter. Was that due to that same type of discussions? Are you getting all your files requested from the GSEs? I'm just wondering, a lot of guys are guiding us to higher numbers towards end of the year, and you're guiding to lower. So have you already been through that process with the GSEs?", "Aleem Gillani", "I'm not sure where others are in their progress with the GSEs. But we feel like last year was our peak, and probably the fourth quarter of last year was our peak, in terms of total demand and provisions. As we look to the next several quarters, the trends that we're seeing are, for example, changes in full file requests and the nature of the full file requests, which we're seeing now. And as you know, those are a precursor to where future demands are moving more toward loans that are earlier stage in delinquency and not in foreclosure. And given that -- given those trends, it looks to us like demands will decline over time. Now there's always going to be some volatility. You never know one quarter to another. But directionally, it does look like, that given where we're seeing in full file requests, demands will actually decline.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So you've been getting full file requests since last year?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. We've been getting full file requests all the way through.", "Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "All the way through?", "Aleem Gillani", "The nature of those full file requests, as they move away from foreclosed loans and toward delinquent loans, is a key indicator for what we're expecting to see in future demands. We -- I think we're improving our dialogue with the agencies all the time. And as we continue to improve communication and dialogue and continue to gain confidence in what we expect to see, we're starting to feel a little bit better about these numbers.", "Operator", "And next question is from Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I'm sure you've seen some other banks try to take an upfront hit to reserve for the mortgage repurchase cost. And I guess I'm just wondering, one, do you just not have enough information to do this, or do you not really believe in kind of kitchen sinking the quarter? Or how should we think about it? Because you've seen others think that it's estimated, well, what the lifetime losses would be at this point.", "William Henry Rogers", "You've just made our CFO perspire a little bit.", "Aleem Gillani", "Matt, I think, yes, you've seen a couple of banks that have provided a lifetime loss, but most haven't. Most banks, including us, have got a reserve that -- which reflects losses that are both probable and estimable. And that line around probable and estimable losses in the reserve, as the industry learns more from the GSEs, probably converges with the line of an estimated lifetime loss. And you might have had a couple of banks this quarter that feel confident enough in their communication and what they're seeing, and there've actually seen those 2 lines cross. I think for the whole industry that's not the case yet. But probably over time, as more and more communication improves with the GSEs, yes, you will see those lines continue to converge and then cross.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I know it's difficult to know sitting here right now, but would you hope that by the end of the year to have enough visibility that you could put this issue behind you as we think about 2013 and beyond? Or is your best guess that, that won't happen?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I'm not sure exactly when it will happen. But, Matt, if your question is, do I hope it will happen? Yes, I hope it will. But I don't know that I can say with complete confidence it will be by the end of this year. Obviously, the sooner, the better.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And your comments about the actual cost itself coming down kind of towards the end of year, by the end of the year, I guess that would imply costs in 3Q similar to 2Q, and then hopefully down the fourth quarter?", "Aleem Gillani", "I don't know that I can give you an exact quarter. But I will say, yes, by the end of this year, they will be down.", "Operator", "Next question is from Ed Najarian, ISI Group.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So I guess my question, my first question is a follow-up on Chris's question about operating costs. When I sort of look at your year-over-year op costs and then I normalize for the TruPS redemption cost this quarter, but then I get about $21 million of lower FDIC-related costs on a year-over-year basis this quarter versus last quarter. And then again, I try to factor in the $250 million of PPG savings. It looks like your internal expense growth rate is running about 5% to 6% annually. Probably that's a little bit higher than what you would call sort of a normalized growth rate x the PPG savings because of the revenue you talked about and because of the strong mortgage quarter, but can you give us a sense of what you think that sort of normal internal growth rate is x expense savings going forward? Would it be 3%, 4%, 5%? How should we think about that?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think the 5% number that you referenced is generally about right. However, remember, that includes the effect of the increased revenue growth also. So looking just at the expense line alone, without looking at the revenue growth and the effect -- the positive effect that's had on the bottom line, might be a little bit one-sided. In terms of what we expect to see as a normalized expense growth number going forward, what we're shooting for is low single digits. And so certainly lower than 5% is what we would expect our core expense growth to be on a normalized basis.", "Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up. When I'm looking at the average balance sheet and I'm looking at your funding costs, specifically sort of aggregated interest-bearing funding costs, in the first quarter, they were 77 basis points. They fell 1 basis point to 76 basis points this quarter, so pretty flat. Now I recognize that you're going to get some benefit from redeeming the TruPS in the third quarter. But other than that TruPS redemption benefit, do you feel like you're starting to run out of room to further drop your funding costs? That's what it would look like just on a -- sort of a one-quarter look basis. Or do you still feel like there are some areas, again, excluding that TruPS benefit, to continue to drive down funding costs?", "Aleem Gillani", "And I'm glad you referenced this was only a one-quarter look. And you're right. We only dropped 1 basis point this quarter, but I don't think that's actually the start of the flattening trend. Now having said that, deposit rates are at absolute low levels. So it's hard for us, or anybody, to grind them down by double digits from here. But we do believe we still have some runway to drop deposit costs further from here, and you may see some of that this quarter. One of the levers we have is maturing CDs. We've got several billion dollars of -- $4 billion of CDs that are going to be maturing between now and the end of the year, and they have the weighted average cost of north of 1%. So you would expect to see those renew at much lower yields between now and the end of the year, and that'll drop our deposit costs, I think, much more than the 1 basis point you saw in Q2.", "Operator", "Next question is from Gerard Cassidy, RBC.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "The question I have is, when you look at your slide, I think it's 25 or so, where you have the detail on the put-back numbers by vintages. The question is the ever 120 days past due that you list there, $21.5 billion, are those outstanding, so we could take it relative to the number you have up above the outstanding UPB at $31.7 billion? Or is that $21.5 billion really reflective of the $120 billion, which is the total sold number?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, that's reflective of the $120 billion.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So the $21.5 billion includes loans that have been paid off, then?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, that's part of the $120 billion that was totally sold.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Do you know how much of the $21.5 billion is in the outstanding UPB bucket?", "William Henry Rogers", "I don't right now. But if you try giving Kris a call later, he may be able to help you.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. And then second, on the cost savings program that you guys announced. One of your competitors yesterday, KeyCorp, announced a cost-savings program, which is a second one for them. They had one in place that ended at the end of 2011. What kind of environment would you have to see where you would announce another similar type of program as the one that's in place now?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, I think, sort of, this goes back to my earlier comments. This isn't so much about a program as it is about a culture and it is about driving to a goal. So I'll continue to talk about what we're doing to drive to a 60% efficiency ratio, and in fairness, I'll probably talk less about programs. As I mentioned in my comments, the program was really the catalyst. I mean, that was to sort of set the initial bar, the starting gun to turn things around. So for us, it's really driving towards that efficiency ratio. I mean, every unit in our company has an efficiency ratio target. They know what they're driving towards. There are lots of corporate initiatives underway that help them get there. But there are lots of just good individual smart thinking and smart management, and it's going to be more of that than the announcement of another program.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Terry McEvoy, Oppenheimer.", "Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I'll move away from expenses. Bill, in the Atlanta Journal last weekend, you said SunTrust is Goldilocks today, or just the right size. I guess my question is, are there certain markets where you need to have a greater presence to get to that Goldilocks position? And in light of the cost-cutting efforts, does it make sense to exit certain markets versus building a scale in investing?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, thanks for reminding me of that reference. My point was right. I might have used a different reference. In -- we've been very careful and planful of having scale and relevance, and I think relevance is the most important comment in all of our markets. There isn't a particular market today that I would say we're not relevant in, that we're looking to have an exit in. Everywhere where we are, we've got an opportunity, and we're big enough, either with branches or commercial lenders or CIB or mortgage or some combination of the businesses that we're engaged in, in a market to be relevant. Now that being said, are we constantly looking at everything and looking at efficiencies, and do we have an opportunity intra-market with leveraging our in stores and traditional branches and loan production ops and all that? Sure, we'll always be looking at that. But the great part about our franchise is the fact that we're in great markets, and we're relevant in those markets. So as a general thesis, no.", "Okay, great. Well, maybe just a quick comment before we wrap up the call, and thank you.", "And though we cannot -- we can't change the operating environment or the pace at which the full recovery happens, but there is plenty that we can do and that we have been doing and will continue to do here at SunTrust. We're building a more effective and efficient company. We're improving our talent base. We're ensuring that our teammates have the tools and training they need to uncover and meet more client needs and deliver the revenue results that we expect. A simple way of putting it is we're building more intensity around everything we do in virtually every corner of our organization.", "So with that being said, again, thank you for joining us today, and please reach out to Investor Relations and Kris with any additional questions that you may have.", "Kris Dickson", "Thank you, everybody.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Kris Dickson, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Kris Dickson", "Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to SunTrust Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call, and thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website at www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause the actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website at www.suntrust.com.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "William Henry Rogers", "Okay. Thanks, Kris. In our normal fashion, I'm going to begin today's call with a brief overview of the quarter. After passing it to Aleem, I'll wrap up with an update on our expense saving program and provide some recent line of business highlights.", "First, I'll begin by acknowledging there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. We have endeavored in our remarks today and throughout the presentation to provide you clarity on those items and how they impacted the results. Aleem will provide more details momentarily, and I think you'll see that we continued the trend of delivering improved core performance. Further, we're positioned to more favorably coming out of the quarter in large part due to the actions we announced in September. Our overall risk profiles improved, and our balance sheet is strengthened. This is highlighted by lower nonperforming and delinquent loans and a mortgage repurchase reserve that now fully covers estimated remaining losses on the pre-2009 vintage GSE loans. As you know, those are the loans from which the vast majority of demands and losses have been generated, and we're able to accomplish all of this while continuing to grow our capital base this quarter.", "Now turning to the presentation. Slide 3 summarizes some of the key drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share was $1.98 with the actions we announced last month contributing $1.40 per share. The diversity of our revenue streams benefited us this quarter. Mortgage production was again strong and investment banking income also increased, while net interest income and margin were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Expenses were up on a reported basis, but excluding the non-core items, they were stable the last quarter and down from the prior year. As you're aware, this continues to be an area where we have lots of focus as we strive to achieve our ultimate goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. I'm going to talk more about this in context of our PPG program later in the call.", "Taking a look at the balance sheet. Overall loan growth was slower, but growth in targeted categories, particularly C&I, drove a nearly $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and a nearly $10 billion increase over last year. This more than offset certain real estate-related loans that we have been actively managing down.", "Now on the deposit side, the favorable mix continued with average DDA growth of 3% from the prior quarter and 19% from the prior year.", "From a credit perspective, derisking of the balance sheet helped drive a 30% reduction in nonperforming loans over last quarter and a 47% decline from last year.", "And as I mentioned earlier, our capital position continued to increase with our Tier 1 common equity ratio estimated at 9.8%, up 40 basis points from last quarter.", "All in all, we're continuing to demonstrate improved core performance. And that, coupled with proactive actions we took this quarter, positions us well for the future.", "I'm going to turn it over to Aleem, let him walk you through the details and I'll give you more -- and give you more clarity on the quarter's results. Aleem?", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. After several noise-free quarters and consistently improving results, as Bill noted, we had a number of lumpy items that impacted the third quarter. So I'll spend a few minutes grounding you on them before we get to the -- in the operating results.", "If you turn to Slide 4, I'll start with an update on the items we preannounced in September. The acceleration of the agreement regarding our Coca-Cola shares generated $1.9 billion in securities gains, and the charitable contribution of 1 million Coke shares to the SunTrust Foundation resulted in the recognition of $38 million of expense.", "Our third quarter mortgage repurchase provision was $371 million. Consistent with last month's announcement, and as Bill noted earlier, we expect the resulting mortgage repurchase reserve to be sufficient to cover the estimated remaining losses from pre-2009 vintage loans sold to the GSEs.", "During the third quarter, we transferred to held for sale slightly over $0.5 billion of nonperforming mortgage and commercial real estate loans. The total net charge-offs recognized in writing the loans down to disposition value was $172 million. The majority of the loan sales were completed during the third quarter with only about $40 million in net balances remaining to be sold this quarter.", "We also transferred to held for sale $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of delinquent Ginnie Mae loans. In doing so, we wrote these loans down to the expected sales price and the $92 million charge, most of which was associated with the delinquent Ginnie Mae loans, was a reduction to noninterest income. You will recall, the majority of the combined $1.9 billion in student and Ginnie Mae loans we're selling are more than 90 days delinquent. Their disposition reduces our delinquency ratio and makes the size of our government-guaranteed loan portfolio more consistent with our longer-term balance sheet targets. All of the transferred loans were included in loans held for sale at quarter end. To date, in the fourth quarter, we've already sold $1 billion of student loans and we expect to complete the remaining student and Ginnie Mae sales by year end.", "We also transferred approximately $190 million of affordable housing investments to held for sale during the quarter. The $96 million write-down taken upon the transfer was recorded as a noninterest expense, and the resultant carrying value reflects our best estimate of the ultimate disposition price. We expect this sale will be completed in the second quarter of 2013.", "Combined, the preannounced items contributed $753 million in net income or $1.40 per common share to the third quarter results. This was exactly on our prior guidance.", "Shifting to the bottom portion of Slide 4, you see 4 other items, the first of which relates to a credit policy change. During the third quarter, we moved the timing of charge-off recognition for junior lien loans from 180 days to 120 days. Our analysis indicated that when junior lien loans go 120 days past due, they rarely cure and typically roll to 180 days. Accordingly, we altered our policy, which resulted in the accelerated recognition of $65 million in incremental net charge-offs in the quarter. For clarity, this is not related to the policy change other large banks made this quarter regarding the treatment of consumer loans that were not reaffirmed following Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We have not received such guidance from our regulator and have not taken any action in response. However, we are monitoring developments. We do estimate that we have approximately $400 million of such loans, about 35% of which are already classified as performing TDRs. We expect to receive coordinated regulatory guidance on this issue and will take any appropriate action at that time.", "I'll cover the final 3 items on the page fairly quickly. I'm pleased to note that our credit spreads tightened considerably in the third quarter. Unfortunately, this also resulted in $41 million in mark-to-market losses on our fair value debt, which reduced noninterest income. Next, we accrued $29 million in severance expense associated with post-PPG efforts to streamline our organization and achieve our efficiency ratio objectives. And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with reassessments and ultimate reduction of our real estate needs.", "Slide 5 provides a summary income statement and the collective impact of the items that I just reviewed are apparent. Third quarter noninterest income was up substantially from prior quarters and the gain from the Coca-Cola transaction more than offset the increased mortgage repurchase provision, the write-down on the student and Ginnie Mae loan sales and the mark-to-market loss on the fair value debt. Provision for credit losses increased this quarter due to the NPL sales and the credit policy change. Expenses were higher due to the affordable write-- affordable housing write-down, the Coke shares donation, severance and the real estate charges.", "Looking at the bottom line, third quarter 2012 earnings per share of $1.98 is up markedly compared to the prior quarters. Obviously, a lot of the favorable variance is driven by the $1.40 per share impact of the September actions. After backing that out, this quarter's EPS of $0.58 continued our favorable core earnings trends, and it compares favorably to the $0.39 from a year ago and the $0.50 from last quarter.", "Subsequent slides provide clearer views of our underlying trends. So let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of net interest income, which was $1.3 billion this quarter and the margin was 3.38%, both of which were down slightly from the prior quarter. Interest income from earning assets declined about $50 million sequentially. This was driven by 3 primary factors: first, we experienced 10 basis points of loan yield compression, mainly driven by mortgage and C&I as new loans that we're originating are coming on the books at lower yields than those that are paying off; second, we saw a 38-basis point decline in our securities yield, which was largely attributable to the elimination of the $15 million quarterly Coke dividend; and lastly, we continue to modestly reduce the size of our bond portfolio in light of the lack of attractive investment alternatives.", "On the liability side, interest expense declined sequentially by $44 million, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was managed down by 14 basis points. This was driven by the reduced funding needs associated with the smaller balance sheet, the previously announced redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities early in the quarter and the maturity of a population of higher-cost CDs, which helped drive the overall cost of time deposits down about 20 basis points.", "Relative to the prior year, net interest income was up modestly, and the margin declined 10 basis points. Key drivers were lower earning asset yields, higher loan balances and reduced interest costs associated with an improved deposit mix, lower deposit rates paid and a reduction in long-term debt.", "As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see a reduction in the net interest margin on the order of mid-single digit basis points, driven by additional reductions in asset yields, which will partially be offset by lower liability costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect a reduction to net interest income as a result of the lower margin, coupled with our smaller balance sheet due to the closed and pending loan sales.", "Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of noninterest income. As we discussed earlier, reported noninterest income was up substantially this quarter due to the favorable net impact associated with the September actions. As usual, we've also provided a view of our adjusted noninterest income, and we detail the adjustments in the Appendix. The $216 million sequential quarter increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, which is booked as a contra-revenue drove the decline in adjusted noninterest income from the second quarter. Otherwise, fee income trends this quarter were solid. Most notable was core mortgage production. Excluding the impact of the repurchase provision, mortgage production income hit a record high this quarter and increased $49 million or almost 20% sequentially. Production volume was high and stable to the second quarter level of about $8 billion, which was split roughly 70-30 between refinancings and purchases.", "Looking ahead, while it is reasonable to assume some volume and margin compression, we do expect overall conditions in the mortgage market to continue to remain favorable in the near term.", "Investment banking was another business that was up sequentially, driven by strong syndication volume. Conversely, the other charges and fee category declined as a result of lower commitment fees, and card fees fell due to a reclassification of card rewards costs. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income declined $111 million, driven by a $254 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Apart from this, adjusted noninterest income increased $143 million or 15%. Similar to the sequential quarter comparisons, strong core mortgage production was the primary driver and higher investment banking revenue also contributed, driven by syndication and bond origination fees. Conversely, card fees declined, primarily due to the impacts of regulatory reform.", "Let's turn to Slide 8 to take a look at mortgage repurchases. For consistency's sake, we've continued to share with you the same layout of this page from prior quarters. But obviously, the important news on the mortgage repurchase issue for us this quarter was contained within our September announcement. Specifically, as a result of additional information we received from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, coupled with our own analysis of the patterns of demands and full file requests, we were able to more precisely estimate the remaining losses on pre-2009 GSE loans, the population of loans that to date have accounted for about 95% of all repurchase losses. As such, we recorded a $371 million provision this quarter, and the resulting mortgage reserve, which you can see on the bottom left of this page, increased to $694 million. Looking forward, we expect this reserve level to decline as the losses are recognized.", "The top left portion of this slide shows that demand has declined to $405 million this quarter, driven primarily by the 2006 to '08 vintages. Demand levels could continue to vary in the coming quarters; however, the trends and full file requests precursors to future demands are improving in 2 ways: first, the absolute number of full file requests is declining. This suggests that, over time, we should begin seeing a decline in the overall level of demands; second, the percentage of full file requests for loans that have never been 120 days past due is increasing, and more recently, delinquent loans tend to have better cure rates. The pending demand population, which is displayed on the top right portion of this page increased to $690 million. This is due to the new demands and a modest extension of resolution time lines. We continue to take a deliberate approach in reviewing repurchase demands, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate yet cure the defects or moderate losses wherever possible. Overall, and in line with what we said in September, the mortgage repurchase trends continue to play out in a manner consistent with our expectations and information we receive from the agencies.", "Let's move on to expenses. Adjusted expenses were essentially stable to the prior quarter. Other real estate costs declined $22 million due to lower losses on disposition, and outside processing fell $9 million. These were offset by increases in employee compensation and FDIC premiums. The $18 million compensation increase was largely due to the accelerated vesting of deferred compensation associated with certain organizational changes and, to a lesser degree, higher contract labor costs. $7 million increase in our FDIC premium is due to quarterly variability in the assessment rate. Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $24 million or 2%, credit-related costs declined driven by a combined $38 million reduction in other real estate and collection services expenses. FDIC premiums also fell by $13 million. Partially offsetting these reductions was an employee compensation and benefits increase of $30 million. This was in part due to the aforementioned accelerated vesting of certain deferred compensation, as well as an overall improvement in business performance.", "As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently expect our adjusted expenses to be flat to down. Cyclically, high costs are expected to continue their overall declining trend and employee compensation is expected to decline. Conversely, certain volume and seasonally driven line items, for example, outside processing and advertising, may increase.", "Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Average performing loans increased by about $900 million or 1%. Growth was driven again this quarter by C&I, which was up $1.1 billion or 2%, and came predominantly from large corporate clients with not-for-profit and auto dealer also contributing. Period-end C&I growth was less robust than in recent quarters as we saw some slowing of loan demand due to borrowers' uncertainties associated with the economic environment and the fiscal cliff. This said, loan pipelines still remain fairly strong. I'll also point out that our corporate investment banking unit has benefited from the increased activity in the bond market via improving bond origination fees during the last couple of quarters. Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by $9.5 billion or 8%. C&I was the largest driver, up $5.7 billion or 12%, with growth across a diverse array of industry verticals. Additionally, guaranteed student loans were up by $2.4 billion and guaranteed mortgages, non-guaranteed mortgages and indirect consumer all increased by around $1 billion. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in home equity, commercial real estate and construction. The effects of this derisking are shown on Slide 11.", "The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by another $0.5 billion this quarter. While we've continued to apply the higher-risk label to this grouping of loans, I'd point out that 95% of this book is accruing. And of that, 98% is current on principal and interest. The non-accruing high-risk loans have been appropriately reserved for and the accruing book looks a lot like the rest of our portfolio. For example, the weighted average refreshed FICO scores of the higher-risk mortgage and home equity books are well above 700. Due to the improved performance of the higher-risk book and its smaller absolute size, you can expect to hear less about this portfolio in future quarters.", "You see in the bottom part of this page that the government-guaranteed portfolio declined by $2.3 billion this quarter. This is largely due to the transfers to held for sale of $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of Ginnie Mae loans. In the fourth quarter, we also expect to transfer to held for sale another approximately $600 million of student loans. This $600 million was included in the loan sale guidance that we gave in September, but did not meet the held for sale accounting criteria at quarter end. We do not expect the gain or loss associated with the fourth quarter transfer to be material.", "Let's take a look at Slide 12 for a review of credit trends. Overall, the credit story is again an improving one this quarter. Early-stage delinquency ratios were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Consumer loans saw normal seasonal increases, which were partially offset by declines in home equity delinquencies. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, consumer and commercial delinquency ratios were 58 and 18 basis points, respectively, which are at relatively low levels. As such, and as is the case with most of our credit metrics, we would expect residential loans to drive future improvements as residential delinquencies are still somewhat elevated by historical standards at just above 1%.", "Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans were down by over $700 million from the prior quarter. A 30% sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans was largely due to the $544 million sale of the mortgage and CRE NPLs. However, excluding these sales, NPLs still declined by about $185 million or over 7%. This decline came despite our adding to NPL, for regulatory guidance, $81 million in junior lien loans that are current on their payments but subordinate to a delinquent risk mortgage. At quarter end, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.42%, down from 1.97% last quarter and 2.76% a year ago. This brought our allowance to NPL ratio up to 130%, a rise of 36 percentage points from the second quarter.", "Net charge-offs this quarter were $511 million as compared to $350 million last quarter. Included in this quarter's figure is the $172 million in net charge-offs associated with the NPL sales and the $65 million from the junior lien credit policy change. Backing these 2 figures out, net charge-offs were $274 million, down $76 million sequentially. Core net charge-offs have trended favorably for some time and we expect that overall trend to continue in the coming quarters. We could see some increase in the fourth quarter from this $274 million level though as a function of some normal seasonality and the fact that our recoveries were about $30 million higher this quarter than what we've experienced recently.", "The allowance for loan and lease losses ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, down about $60 million from the prior quarter, due to the improving core credit quality trends. Despite the modest dollar decline in the allowance this quarter, the allowance ratio remained essentially unchanged at 1.84% on a stated basis or just above 2% when excluding government-guaranteed loans from the calculation.", "Taking a step back, when you take a look at what we have done to improve the risk profile of the organization over the last little while, the last 2 slides make that really evident. We've been aggressively and intentionally reducing our higher-risk book for several years. Those balances are down by $14.6 billion or more than 60% over the past few years, so our derisking is largely complete. Nonperforming loans have been on a similar trajectory, down by $3.8 billion or almost 70% since their peak in 2009. And we took actions to further accelerate this decline this quarter as well as reduce our 90-day plus delinquency ratio. Overall, we have made meaningful and substantial strides that have resulted in a much improved risk profile for SunTrust.", "Let's next take a look at our deposit performance. Average deposit balances declined modestly from the prior quarter and the favorable shift in deposit mix continued. Noninterest-bearing deposits were up $1.3 billion or 3%. This was essentially offset by a $1.2 billion or 7% reduction in time deposits as we had an above average amount of CD maturities during the third quarter. We also saw a modest decline in money market balances as we're being deliberate about pricing discipline and have let certain promotional rates expire. Relative to the prior year, deposits are up $2.4 billion or about 2%. Lower-cost accounts are the driver of the growth, led by almost $6 billion or 19% DDA growth. Conversely, higher-cost time deposits are down by $3.4 billion or 17%.", "Slide 14 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased by approximately $400 million. Recall that the September actions were essentially neutral to our regulatory capital level, so this quarter's increase is primarily driven by core earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.8%, up a healthy 40 basis points from last quarter. Our estimate for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, assuming that all the components of the Federal Reserve's recent notice of proposed rulemaking are implemented in their current form, held relatively stable at 7.9%.", "As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio increased by 16 basis points sequentially due to a reduction in the asset base, and tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $25.72, down 1% from the prior quarter as the modest tangible book value dilution associated with the September actions was largely offset by this quarter's core earnings.", "With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover the last few slides.", "William Henry Rogers", "Okay, and I'll move to Slide 15. And during the third quarter, we achieved our PPG expense program target well ahead of schedule, realizing a little over $75 million in quarterly savings or obviously $300 million on an annualized run rate. The collective efforts that got us here so quickly should not be minimized. A lot was accomplished in a relatively short period of time, and that's a result of our teammates' intensity around delivering results. But that being said, it's not lost on me or anyone at SunTrust that we still have work to do. The PPG program served as a catalyst towards achieving our ultimate goal of significantly improving the overall efficiency of the organization. It's been successful in not only garnering meaningful savings, but also in galvanizing our team in pursuit of our sub-60 efficiency ratio goal.", "So now that we've hit our PPG target, what kind of updates can you expect from here? Well, we're not going to roll out a new program with a new name nor will we publicly track our progress beyond the $300 million goal. But I will tell you that we're not finished in our efforts to improve our efficiency. As a matter of fact, we're just getting started. And going forward, I want you to measure us by the same metric that we're holding ourselves accountable, our efficiency ratio. We've incorporated this metric into our incentive compensation plans. We've built a lot of intensity throughout the bank, around improving both the revenue and expense components of the calculation. So PPG was instrumental in getting us on the track and we'll leverage that momentum as we go forward.", "Now moving to the next slide, and before we move into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made from a line-of-business perspective.", "In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we've had another quarter of solid loan production growth with year-to-date volume 15% ahead of last year. Favorable deposit trends also continued as we generated year-over-year DDA growth of 14%. And though from a revenue perspective, this business continues to be challenged due to regulatory headwinds, we have reduced expenses here by 3% from last year. Clients are increasingly utilizing self-service channels, which, as just one example, has enabled us to make changes to our staffing model to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Our Wholesale business continues to deliver strong results with year-to-date net income nearly double what it was a year ago. Significant growth in capital markets fees, coupled with a higher net interest income, drove Wholesale revenue gains of 14% over the third quarter of last year. Loans were up 8% and client deposits increased 5%. Furthermore, our Corporate Investment Banking business surpassed last quarter's revenue and net income levels, marking yet another quarter of record performance. While the Mortgage business reported a net loss, primarily due to the increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve and the mortgage NPL sale, core trends continued to markedly improve. Year-to-date mortgage production volume was $24 billion, up nearly $8 billion or 48% from last year and core mortgage origination income was $460 million higher, more than 130% increase from last year. The elevated levels of refinance activity have certainly been beneficial to the business while we're also continuing to devote resources to purchase activity, a core bread-and-butter business for us, and one that we think will again be the primary driver of mortgage revenue when the refi volume eventually tapers off. Additionally, we're also focused on building out channels and driving volume with better channel selection to maximize ROI and the longer-term return profile for this business.", "So overall, this marked another quarter of positively trending core line of business performance. The diversity of our business mix has and will continue to benefit us as we go forward, and I'm pleased with the heightened intensity level at which our leaders and teammates are operating, focused on meeting our clients' needs and driving higher levels of return for our shareholders.", "So Kris, let me turn it back over to you, and we'll take some questions.", "Kris Dickson", "Thanks, Bill. Wendy, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Pancari with Evercore Partners.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Wonder if you can give us more color on your -- possibly your 2013 margin outlook given your securities yields and loan yields you're seeing some downside reinvestment risk there, but relatively more resilient than we thought this quarter. So can you just give a little more color in terms of your outlook beyond the fourth quarter?", "William Henry Rogers", "Sure, John. Well, as you know, the big issue, obviously, is that the new loans coming on are coming on at lower going-on yields than the roll-off and securities continue to pay down. We're being very careful with the way in which we reinvest our securities book. Obviously, we're not really getting paid given the flat yield curve that take a lot of duration risk. And you saw that impact a little bit in the size of our securities book coming down a little bit this quarter. But I think what you'll see for the whole industry, as you look out, if we stay in this lower for longer environment through next year, I think you'll see the whole industry start to decrease margins probably in the, sort of, a few basis points per quarter every quarter just continuing to grind down.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So that guidance you have for the fourth quarter, is that fair to assume that, that's the pace of compression to expect going through '13, or could that accelerate at all just as your funding cost leverage gradually abates?", "Aleem Gillani", "It may accelerate, it may decelerate, too. I don't know that it's a consistent every-quarter decline. There is some variability quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we did receive the benefit of a number of our higher-cost CDs rolling off and that's why our margin declined only 1 basis point overall. So I think you look for some volatility with some quarters declining less and some quarters declining more. But if you look out at the trend overall, I'd look for it to be generally on the order of a few basis points a quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So when you think about the expense base, now you have all of PPG in the run rate, I'm seeing a core efficiency ratio of somewhere in the mid-60s. So can you just talk a little bit more about how you plan on closing the gap to get below 60%? I know you highlighted that you're just getting started and clearly it's a big focus internally, but can you talk about some of the levers that you still have on the expense side, particularly if the revenue picture remains weak? And from there, if you would assess the driver of reaching the targeted levels, will we need to see more on the revenue side or the expense side from here to get there?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, so to start with, I think you've got it figured out. Obviously, this quarter's efficiency ratio is a little lower. We were very clear internally that it wasn't mission accomplished. If you think about our core expense base, say, over the last 6 quarters, it's been fairly stable, so call it sort of $1.5 billion sort of core expense base. But the revenue sort of has gone from about $2.2 billion to about $2.4 billion. So you could say one side of the coin was we'd expect to see more expense savings at this particular juncture. But we've had a couple of our businesses, mortgages and -- mortgage and CIB has been sort of 2 of the examples that we're going to invest in right now because we see good revenue opportunities. So think about it sort of from that context. So what's left, I mean what are the opportunities? I mean, the list is pretty significant. We have a lot more to do in the consumer rationalization of our business spans and layers, incentive efficiencies. You saw some of the charges we took for real estate, so we still have some other real estate opportunities. Core process, consolidation, shared services. I mean, the list is actually fairly extensive. And while I said PPG was the start, I mean I meant that. I mean, it really sort of got the ball rolling down the hill. I would call that maybe some of the more low-lying fruit. Now we're going to get a little higher in the tree. But there are significant opportunities. Is it more expense or is it more revenue? A lot of that'll depend on where the market takes us. If refinance activity continues like we think it will in Mortgage, it'll be a little slower to get down to that efficiency ratio. We continue to do what we've been able to do on the CIB side. Similarly, it'll take a little bit longer. So I think it's -- and we've been very clear about saying it's the efficiency ratio versus just expense or just revenue initiatives. And I'm confident that we're on the path. I can't commit to the exact time line, but I'm confident we're on the path. And if you look into our line of businesses, start looking at the efficiency improvements within those and I think they're pretty good leading indicators of where we're going as a total company.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then if I could just ask one follow-up as a follow-up to John's question. When you think about -- you obviously said the NIMs coming down a couple of basis points a quarter, but when you think about the trajectory for NII for 4Q and beyond, how should we think about, just given Aleem's comments on asset yield spreads and reinvestment yields, should we expect that NII is going to come down at a similar pace, or do you think we can actually see enough growth to offset some of the compression?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think for next year, Ryan, I would think about NII for the full year likely to be lower than the full year 2012. Basically, we've got the changes from the foregone dividend and Coca-Cola and the loan sales. In Q2, recall we had a step-down in loan swap income. So full year I would think of as being lower next year than this year. There's some positives and negatives there. On the positive side, we are continuing to manage down our non-deposit maturity rates. Obviously, in the compressed yield environment on liabilities, there's a decreasing opportunity there, but we do have more CDs maturing. We have about $7 billion of CDs maturing during the next 5 quarters, between now and the end of next year. And as those renew, they will renew at lower yields. And against that, we're fighting against the challenging asset yield compression environment. And as a reminder, we will have another step-down as a result of swaps rolling off in Q2 next year. So year-over-year, I would think of NII coming down overall, but we know we still have some levers to pull and we're working on those.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wanted to talk a little bit about mortgage repurchase, reps and warranties. Could you give us a sense as to how you think your expenses are going to be running over the next several quarters? I think, in September you said $5 million to $10 million a quarter. Just wondering if that's still a good number or not.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, I think it is. I think we said $10 million a quarter in September and we think that $10 million is still a reasonable number. Small range around that, probably sort of plus or minus $5 million. But I think that's a good center for the overall number.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And does that represent -- does that include the increases in repurchase requests that came through in the quarter? Obviously, they were up in the quarter.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, the demands were actually down in the quarter, Q3 versus Q2. And I think they're down to the lowest level we've now seen in the last several quarters. But yes, it includes everything that we've seen so far and it includes the reserve that we need for new mortgages that we're putting on.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Right. The pending repurchase requests were up, though?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, the pending repurchase requests were up, but that's partly as a result of us being very deliberate around looking at every single file and making sure that we take the time necessary to try to cure every issue rather than acceding to a demand.", "William Henry Rogers", "I think another way of saying it is really everything that we represented in terms of taking this reserve in September is as we thought it was or better, and particularly as it relates to full file requests, which is sort of that leading indicator, they're probably even better than we thought they'd be. In other words, lower.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can you just remind us what the swap impact on the NIM and the net interest income dollars will be? I guess, it's 1Q to 2Q where there's the step-down that you referenced?", "Aleem Gillani", "There is another step-down in Q2, Matt. I think we've got about $1 billion notional of swaps rolling off. And so that's about $10 million or $15 million per quarter in NII at that time.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just separately, if we look at your credit-related costs, they were down both year-over-year and linked quarter and that's actually better than what we've seen at a number of other banks that have had Q2 increases. And just maybe wondering why there's some divergence maybe between you and the industry, and it sounds like those costs will continue to come down from here.", "Aleem Gillani", "We do expect those costs to continue to come down a little bit, Matt. I think, maybe to be fair to the rest of the industry, they've been a little slower in coming down here. So I think this quarter, we're catching up a little bit. And you'll recall that in September, we had guided some of those costs down by about $20 million per quarter for the end of the year and we achieved $15 million of that $20 million this quarter. So perhaps a little bit faster than we had anticipated then, but we do continue to expect those costs to continue to come down.", "William Henry Rogers", "And as, Matt, we've said, they'll continue to trend down quarter-to-quarter. It's hard to tell exactly what's going to happen, but I think it's safe to say that the trend will continue. The slope of this quarter may have been unusually high.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So the $20 million per quarter decline that you had signaled related to the balance sheet repositioning, is most of that in the run rate in the third quarter, so we should take this run rate and take out $5 million to get to the minus $20 million then whatever else we'd assume for the rest of the pool, is that the way to think about it?", "William Henry Rogers", "That's generally correct. There's obviously going to be some volatility. We're not going to be able to forecast these costs within $5 million on a quarterly basis, but that's generally correct. We expected to hit $20 million by year end. We achieved a lot of that very quickly. But after we hit the $20 million, I would continue to expect those costs to move down next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I want to ask you about the loan demand and that how one hand is talking about the slowing loan demand. On the other, you're talking about how the pipeline is strong. Can you talk about the kind of what you're seeing there to -- for those comments to both jive together?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes, Jefferson, and it is a bit of a dichotomy of different views. But what we're seeing is some slowdown and I think that's not been inconsistent with sort of HA [ph] data on pricing. But our pipelines are actually very good and they are as large or not larger than they've been in prior quarters. The pull-through rate is just slower. And we could all speculate as to why that might be. I think there clearly is some pent-up demand. When I'm out and about and talking to business owners and other CEOs, what I hear is we're going to wait. So we're encouraged by the fact that the pipeline's up. We're encouraged by the fact that we're having increased higher-level dialogue with our clients, but the pull-through rate almost has -- was slower this quarter. No doubt about it.", "Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "All right. So if you think about the 2% average loan growth this quarter, you think that should generally pick up or slow down or remain the same in the future?", "William Henry Rogers", "It's hard to speculate because we're sort of dealing with a bit of a new phenomenon here in that, normally, we could look at pipelines. We could ascribe a pull-through rate of some consistency against those and be able to project that with a lot more consistency. Today, there's a little bit more of an unknown. So while I'm optimistic overall in the sense that we're -- the pipelines are big and the activity and the dialogue, I'm a little hesitant to predict exactly what's going to happen in the next quarter or 2.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow on the environmental expense question real quick. So 2 of the most important lines within the operating losses and the credit and collection, they were slightly higher quarter-to-quarter and taking your point that it's hard to think about quarter-to-quarter, I just wanted to ask a more qualitative question. What does it take for those 2 lines to start -- I know you're expecting that those 2 subcategories are going to improve, but how long is the lag versus other credit improvement for operating losses and credit and collections, specifically, to really start moving down? Is there a trigger point where they just start to accelerate or is this a multi multiyear drag for them to meaningfully reduce?", "William Henry Rogers", "Well, Ken, I certainly hope it's not a multiyear drag. I don't know that there's a trigger point that I could point you to, but I think there are sort of several things that you could look at, the improvements that we've made over the last couple of years, particularly some of the actions that we took this quarter also. The sale of some of our NPL loans, the sale of the Ginnie Maes, that should help also reduce some of those credit and collection costs going forward. Those are very labor-intensive loans to attempt to collect and work on over time. So I think -- we would think of that as a little bit of a trigger point. And in operating losses, there are a lot of numbers built into there -- built into that, that includes operational losses, that includes broad losses, it includes items we've got in there to build up litigation reserves. There are a lot of different numbers in there and I would look for that line to also start to come down relatively quickly as we start to think about 2013 now. And in fairness, it's not all these numbers and it's other numbers as well. But I've been pretty clear in stating that we're going to be conservative in taking some of these costs down. I mean, this was a very expensive system to build. We're really, really good at it. And so some of these hard costs and tracking this down, we're going to probably lag a little bit. And I think that's the prudent way to do it. We don't want the trucks ahead of the gas line, so to speak. So we're going to be probably a little bit conservative in bringing these down. And think about it, a lot of the costs are related to this. They just happened in the third quarter. So we'll start seeing some of that run rate come through in the fourth quarter and moving forward.", "Aleem Gillani", "I think, Ken, if you look at the run rate year-over-year, I think last year our run rate was something like $800 million. This year, our run rate is considerably below that. And I would expect next year, our run rate will decline further.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. And then my second question, Aleem, just wondering if you can help us understand how the earning asset trends should look from here because period end was, what, $152.5 million versus $153.8 million average. The timing of all the moving parts in the fourth quarter is a little tricky to understand. Then you have some underlying growth. I just wondered if you can give us kind of -- maybe even just a range of how you expect the earning asset base to trend in the fourth quarter?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think with the sales that we announced, you think about that as being about $3 billion coming out of earning assets. So start with that lower level. And I think the answer, Ken, is going to be sort of very pipeline and economy dependent in the very short term. If we can get the economy out of this malaise, you would expect to see earning assets start to climb now from that lower level that we see. But in the very short term, the next quarter or 2, while we are -- while we do have some fairly strong pipeline, it does feel like a lot of clients are being very cautious about adding new debt levels to their balance sheet and it's a bit of a challenge out there. It's a bit of a fight every day as we look to try and service our clients and grow assets that we have from here. I would look for growth. I would look for a higher balance sheet. But just to remember to start from that lower number after the sale this quarter.", "Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So you're saying that the $3 billion pretty much is the right average to take out of this quarter's number?", "Aleem Gillani", "I think on average, that's fine. Some of those sales already came out, as I said, early this quarter, some will come out a little bit later in the quarter. But on average, that should be about right.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess more of a conceptual question related to the mortgage business that's obviously doing very, very well right now, but one of the questions that I often get from investors is how confident you all are that you can take costs out of the Mortgage business once that business begins to normalize at some point next year, and how that might affect your thinking on the efficiency ratio.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, I'll take a shot. The expenses related to the Mortgage business sort of don't follow an exact quarter-to-quarter. As I said in my comments, not only sort of what we use, what I'd call the traditional methods, so as you see that decline, you see normal expenses come down and they tend to lag a quarter or 2 depending on how much of the volume is purchased and how much is refinanced. So obviously, it'll lag more for refinanced and less for purchased. But what we're doing is a fairly significant sort of redesign of the channels in the business as we're going through this. One of the real silver linings behind HARP is where it really has afforded us the opportunity to build out our consumer direct channel. And that channel, as a percent of our business a year ago, was pretty small. It's about 10% of our business now and it is a much more efficient part of the structure. So not only sort of do you have the traditional tools, we're also going through a pretty, as I said, a redesign of the channel mix. So I'm actually fairly confident when we come out of this, we'll come out of this with a higher-margin business relative to how we entered this from the changes that we're making now.", "William Henry Rogers", "Hey, Matt, I'd also add one more point and that is I'd also remind you that over the last little while, we've spent several tens of millions of dollars around the consent order, consulting costs around the independent workload review. And as you look out to next year, I would expect all of those costs to abate, and that'll also provide a nice lift to the overall performance of the Mortgage business.", "Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess just for my follow-up, just a quick question for Aleem. Aleem, what percentage of the mortgage originations this quarter related to HARP?", "Aleem Gillani", "In total, if you look at our total origination, Matt, it was about sort of 70-30 refi versus purchase. And of the refi, about 30% of the total refi was HARP. So if you work that through, about 20% of our total business this quarter was HARP.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "When you guys gave us the estimates on the core expenses of about $1.5 billion for the quarter, what would your estimate be of the associated environmental cost or OREO cost in that number in this quarter? How would that compare to a more normalized number when we get out of the mess on credit?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think, Matt -- Gerard, if you take a look at that expense slide that we got, 28, in the deck, yes, you get a sense of what the environmental costs have been within that number. And as we said earlier, that run rate is coming down pretty nicely from where it was last year and where it peaked. And I would expect that to continue to come down. If you think about a really normalized number, I mean, back in the day, that line item for us had a run rate of about $200 million annually. I don't think that we'll ever get back to that kind of a number, but it might be reasonable to assume that, that kind of a number from $200 million might double. But even when it doubles, it's 1/2 of the $800 million we ran at last year.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. The second question was you guys indicated that $400 million of the so-called Chapter 7 type loans that the OCC regulated banks have had to identify this quarter and put into nonperforming, how much of the $400 million -- you mentioned what's performing TDR in your release, but how much of the $400 million has already been reserved for? And if you are required to put the entire $400 million on nonperforming, what type of provision would you have to take to build up that reserve?", "Aleem Gillani", "I'm not sure I could give you an answer to that one yet. This guidance came out right at the end of the quarter and we were not subject to it, so we're currently doing the analysis to see what the total looks like. But at a higher level, I think given that these are performing loans, you would expect that the reserve against them would be very minimal to nonexistent. And the idea that we would take them and put them into nonperforming may or may not have an impact on provisions. We're still waiting for coordinated guidance across from all the agencies. And obviously, when we hear that, we will take action immediately.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Greg Ketron with UBS.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Aleem, a question on mortgage repurchase. If I -- I think I heard this right. You had mentioned that you did see a uptick in requests on performing loans. And if so, how that might affect -- is that included already in the reserve that you've set up or would that change your thinking or approach on the mortgage repurchase reserve?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, Greg. Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear on that. It's not an uptick on the request in performing loans. It's a percent of change. So that, overall, the demands were down. But out of that total decreasing number, the percentage on loans that have never been 120 is going up. So they're less delinquent and they're more recent, and therefore, contain a lower loss content than the demands on previous loans that we were getting. Does that make more sense?", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, yes. I just was thinking in terms of how that might impact or if there is any impact to the reserve that you've established today.", "Aleem Gillani", "Any impact is positive as these have lower loss content and that was already included in the provision that we took in the quarter. So I think the reserve that we have got now should be sufficient to cover everything that we're required to cover.", "Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then maybe a bigger picture question for you, Bill. We've seen a number of housing data points be very positive, particularly in the Southeast in terms of home prices, housing starts, you name it, it's all been a pretty steady stream of good data. How does that impact SunTrust from a bigger picture standpoint in terms of demand, maybe seeing Florida -- you've had a tremendous backlog in Florida, maybe seeing that speed up. And does that ultimately help lower these credit costs -- if this trajectory continues, does that ultimately help lower the credit costs faster?", "William Henry Rogers", "I think actually the biggest tie to housing value increase and what it does for us is increasing consumer confidence. I honestly think that's sort of the biggest tie if you can think about sort of where people are coming from, this being their largest asset. When that starts to change, they look at their, sort of as a general comment, they're more deleveraged than they were before. I think this just tries to unlock some of the consumer confidence. We're still more tied to employment than housing values, but that's also seeing some positive trajectory. I mean, take -- use Florida as an example. While still above the national average, the improvement in Florida and unemployment's gone from 10.6 to 8.7. So the largest probably percent of improvement, coupled with housing values, I mean I think it's really a consumer confidence game in terms of the opportunity for us. And we feel it.", "Let me just make a quick comment before we wrap up the call today. We've made significant progress in more favorably positioning the bank through -- for the future. That's through specific actions we've taken during the quarter, but really more broadly, through the benefits of some of our strategic operating decisions. We are building a more effective and efficient company, not only through expense savings, but also in the way that we're approaching revenue generation. A significant opportunity exists to leverage the loyalty that we've built, and our team has the tools and training they need to uncover more client needs and further deepen those relationships. And that's not to say that the path ahead is not without its challenges. But there is a high level of intensity across the organization around translating opportunity into results. And I believe we're focusing that energy in areas that can best impact bottom line performance. So with that said, thank you for joining us today and please reach out to our Investor Relations team with any other questions you may have.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I would now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thank you, Jill. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.

So I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter before turning the call over to Aleem for more details on our results. I'll then wrap up with a review of our segment performance and a 2013 total year recap.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.77 on net income of $413 million. Excluding the significant items that impacted the third quarter, earnings per share grew 16% on a sequential quarter basis. We generated modest revenue growth as net interest income increased slightly from the prior quarter due to loan growth and adjusted noninterest income improved in part due to increases in mortgage servicing and trading income.", "Expenses increased $53 million sequentially after adjusting for the significant third quarter items. This was primarily the result of higher employee compensation and benefits expense due to an abnormally low third quarter in which we explicitly reduced incentive compensation. In the fourth quarter, it was accrued at a more normal level. Operating losses on an adjusted basis were also higher this quarter over last. Expenses, however, were down 9% from the fourth quarter of last year as a result of our continued expense management focus, coupled with declines in cyclical costs.", "Average performing loans continued on a positive trend, increasing $3.1 billion to 3% over last quarter with growth across several loan portfolios. And average client deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter with the continuation of the favorable mix shift. Credit quality continued to improve with nonperforming loans and net charge-offs hitting new 6-year lows. Nonperforming loans declined 6% from last quarter and 37% from last year. And this quarter's net charge-off ratio improved to 40 basis points. Lastly, our capital position remained solid with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel I basis and 9.6% on a Basel III basis.", "So now let me turn it over to Aleem for more details.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. Before I begin my review of this quarter, let me remind you that our third quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.33 due to the closure of several legacy mortgage and related matters. In addition, our third quarter of 2012 EPS was positively impacted by $1.40 due to the actions we announced in September of that year. Both of these actions skew sequential quarter and annual comparisons. Therefore, I will focus on core trends where applicable.", "As Bill said, earnings per share this quarter was $0.77, which was $0.16 -- 16% higher than adjusted EPS in the previous quarter and 18% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. The sequential quarter increase was due to increased revenue and a beneficial effective tax rate, which more than offset higher adjusted noninterest expense.", "The effective tax rate this quarter was caused by certain discrete year-end items. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, earnings improved due to lower loan-loss provision and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower mortgage production income and net interest income. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $2.74. This growth was driven by lower loan-loss provision and lower noninterest expense, which more than offset declines in mortgage-related revenues and net interest income. We'll review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5.", "Net interest income and the net interest margin were generally stable relative to the prior quarter. The net interest margin improved 1 basis point as higher securities yields and slightly lower deposit rates offset a 4 basis point decline in loan yields. Securities yields increased 18 basis points due to slower premium amortization on mortgage-backed securities given the increase in market interest rates. Higher securities yields were the driver of net interest margin being modestly higher than our previous guidance. Net interest income increased $7 million sequentially, primarily due to solid loan growth offsetting the decline in loan yields.", "Relative to the fourth quarter of 2012, net interest income was $29 million lower and the net interest margin declined 16 basis points. The primary drivers of both were lower loan yields and a reduction in commercial loan swap income, which were partially offset by lower deposit rates and a favorable shift in the deposit mix. Net interest income benefited from higher average earning assets. Looking forward, and assuming current rate expectations do occur, we expect the net interest margin to decline for the full year 2014 compared to the full year 2013, albeit at a lower rate relative to the decline we experienced this year.", "The primary driver of this decline will be a further compression in loan yields due to the continued low short-term interest rate environment, partially offset by the benefits of a steepening curve. With regard to net interest income, we would anticipate year-over-year improvements, assuming loan growth continues. However, with respect to the first quarter, there are 2 fewer days, which all things being equal, has the impact of reducing net interest income by $10 million to $15 million.", "Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased $64 million from the previous quarter due to the lease financing impairment we recognized in Q3 in addition to higher mortgage servicing and trading income. Excluding the impact of the repurchase settlements in the previous quarter, mortgage production income declined sequentially from $53 million to $31 million. This was principally driven by a decline in origination fees from $44 million to $23 million as a result of the approximate 50% decline in closed loan volume. Mortgage servicing income, however, increased 26 -- $27 million sequentially, primarily due to lower decay in the MSR asset, which is largely the result of lower refinance activity.", "Trading income also increased by $24 million this quarter, which was driven by improvement in client-related trading revenues, alongside $14 million in combined mark-to-market gains on fair value of debts and the valuation of certain illiquid securities. Client-related trading income rose as improved market conditions increased activity amongst our fixed income product client base.", "Investment banking had another strong quarter, though revenues were slightly lower on a sequential basis as a drop in fixed income origination revenue was partially offset by higher M&A and equity-related fees. Retail investment services continued its positive trend, resulting from fixed annuity sales and managed account growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted noninterest income declined $193 million, primarily due to lower mortgage production income as a result of both lower gain-on-sale margins and lower production volume. This was partially offset by solid improvement in wealth management-related revenues.", "Let's move to expenses on Slide 7. Reported noninterest expense decreased $366 million from the previous quarter, driven entirely by the expenses associated with the third quarter legacy mortgage matters. On an adjusted basis, expenses increased $53 million sequentially. Compensation and benefits expense increased $41 million as a result of the $37 million reduction in incentive compensation in the third quarter. Operating losses also increased $15 million on an adjusted basis due to mortgage-related regulatory and legal expenses incurred this quarter.", "Overall, as we observe on Slide 20 in the Appendix, our cyclical costs were $352 million for the full year, excluding the noted items from third quarter. This represents a significant decline from the $655 million we incurred in 2012. For 2014, we expect modest additional declines in aggregate cyclical costs, though the operating loss component can be volatile as evidenced by the quarterly trends we saw this year. Looking at year-over-year, I'm pleased with our Q4 noninterest expense reduction of 9%, which was driven by widespread reductions in core operating expense categories, as well as the abatement of cyclical costs. As we look to the first quarter, we currently anticipate approximately $50 million in higher 401(k) and FICA expenses and slightly higher medical benefits-related expenses to drive the normal seasonal increase in employee benefits and compensation expenses.", "As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was slightly higher relative to the previous quarter, bringing the year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 65.8%. This represents over 6 percentage points of improvement relative to 2011 and 3.5 percentage points of improvement relative to 2012. We are disappointed that we did not meet our goal of approximately 65% for the full year, and we remain solidly focused on becoming a more efficient operator across all of our businesses. As we look to 2014, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio target is less than 64%. Future progress on the efficiency ratio will be more challenging relative to the achievements over the previous 2 years. However, we remain firmly committed to delivering on our long-term objective of less than 60%.", "Turning to credit quality. Asset quality continued to improve this quarter with the net charge-off ratio declining from 47 basis points to 40 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming loans were also lower, declining 6% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. These improvements in asset quality drove a 7 basis point decline in the allowance for loan and lease-loss ratio. Recent improvements in asset quality continue to be driven by the stronger housing market through lower residential delinquencies, lower loss severities and higher prices upon disposition of foreclosed assets. The loan-loss provision increased $6 million sequentially as the solid loan growth offset the improvements in asset quality. As we look to 2014, we expect further but moderating improvements in asset quality, primarily driven by residential loans. However, as we experienced this quarter, positive loan growth may offset future asset quality improvements, and thus impact sequential changes in the loan-loss provision.", "Turning to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased by $3.1 billion or about 3%, which is the highest sequential quarter loan growth we have delivered since the first quarter 2012. End-of-period performing loans grew $3.6 billion as the result of a strong December. Growth was broad-based across most portfolios, though principally driven by C&I, CRE and nonguaranteed residential mortgage.", "C&I loan growth was driven by the not-for-profit and government business, the commercial dealer group and broad-based growth across most CIB industry verticals. Average CRE loans were up 10% sequentially due to extended relationships with clients in our footprint, growth in our institutional business and success in our REIT platform. Nonguaranteed residential mortgages grew primarily due to the addition of high-quality jumbo mortgages to our portfolio. Lastly, consumer loan balances were also up modestly with growth across most portfolios. Relative to the prior year, average performing loans increased $4.7 billion, driven by targeted growth in our C&I and CRE portfolios. Overall, loan growth was solid this quarter as the investments we had made in many of our businesses continued to bear fruit and the economic indicators in our markets continued to improve.", "Let's take a look at deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially as growth in low-cost deposits, primarily NOW accounts, offset modest declines in higher-cost time deposits. Relative to the prior year, deposits were essentially flat, although the underlying favorable shift in the deposit mix is the more notable event. This favorable shift in deposit mix helped drive down interest-bearing deposit costs by 8 basis points year-over-year.", "Slide 12 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital expanded by approximately $300 million as a result of growth in retained earnings. Our key capital ratios were generally stable as growth in the numerator was offset by the loan growth we delivered this quarter. In addition, tangible book value per share increased 3% due to the growth in total equity.", "Pursuant to our 2013 capital plan, we have now completed our $200 million stock buyback program. Later this quarter, we will be notified of the results of our 2014 CCAR submission. And we will provide you more information on future capital returns at that time.", "With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance and provide a recap of the full year.", "William Henry Rogers", "Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. We saw the continuation of several core operating trends in our business segments this quarter.", "In our consumer banking and private wealth management business, significant net income growth was driven by ongoing credit and expense improvements. Noninterest income declined modestly from the same quarter last year, partially due to a onetime gain related to the student loan sales in the fourth quarter of last year. However, we experienced solid growth of 8% in wealth management-related revenues. Expenses were down 8%, partially the result of a more efficient branch network and staffing model as we reduced our number of branches by 7% over last year.", "We made meaningful progress in our efforts to better align our distribution channels with evolving client preferences. Going forward, we do expect additional net reductions in our branch network. However, the overall rate of decline in 2014 will slow when compared to 2013. Furthermore, provision for credit losses decreased meaningfully as credit quality improved, almost entirely driven by home equity, given the improving housing market.", "We've steadily improved the tangible efficiency ratio in this segment, driving it down approximately 350 basis points in the last year to 67.1%. Average loan balances were flat from last year due to the fourth quarter student loan sales, though we continue to see solid organic loan production, particularly in home equity, consumer, card, consumer direct and auto. Consumer loan production was up 8% year-over-year. Taking a look at 2013 in aggregate, net income was up 88%, driven by solid progress and our expense management efforts, along with our aforementioned credit quality improvements. Furthermore, similar to the quarter-to-quarter results, we generated 8% growth in consumer lending and 5% growth in wealth management-related revenues.", "Let's take a closer look at our wholesale business. Wholesale had a strong quarter, with record net income of $259 million, continuing its positive momentum. Net interest income increased 4% due to solid loan and deposit growth. However, noninterest income declined primarily as a result of a onetime trading-related benefit and record investment banking income in the fourth quarter of 2012. The declines in noninterest income were the primary driver of the increase in the efficiency ratio when compared to the prior year.", "Average loans grew $4.7 billion or 9% with further growth in core CRE, our not-for-profit and government business, our commercial dealer group and our large corporate lending areas, most notably asset securitization, asset-based lending and our energy and health care verticals. Overall, our pipelines continued to be healthy and have demonstrated year-over-year growth. And while wholesale loan yields compressed in the fourth quarter, it was at a slower pace than we've previously been experiencing.", "Wholesale has been a growth driver and should continue to provide solid performance for us in 2014. 2013 marked a record year for investment banking income. And it's important to note that the revenue mix here is increasingly diverse. CRE also continues to grow across our 4 main target areas. Our wholesale business is very well positioned to compete and we have meaningful runway in each of our key lines of business.", "Let's look at mortgage. The net loss in mortgage this quarter was stable through the same quarter last year as revenue declines were offset by lower provision expense as credit quality improved, along with other expense reductions due to the abatement of cyclical cost and our efforts to right-size this business. Taking a closer look at revenue, noninterest income was negatively impacted by the decline in mortgage production volume and gain-on-sale margins. Servicing income also decreased modestly year-over-year, given the lower net hedge performance, and increased sequentially, given the lower decay in the MSR asset.", "So looking ahead, we continue to expect growth in purchase market originations, though it will not offset the significant decline in refinance activity we experienced this past year. Expenses were down 21% compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to make good progress here. You'll recall in the third quarter, we outlined our intent to reduce core expenses by approximately $50 million a quarter from the third quarter core run rate or about 20%. We should begin to see this come fully into the run rate in the second quarter.", "So in summary, we're taking the actions we believe are necessary to return this business to profitability. We'll continue to be responsive to changes in the evolving operating environment and the opportunities within our markets. So before we get into the Q&A though, I'd like to take a step back and look at our corporate performance maybe in aggregate for the year.", "During the course of 2013, SunTrust made meaningful progress in several key areas. This progress is reflected in the 25% growth in adjusted earnings per share over the prior year. Bottom line gains were driven by a notable 12% decline in adjusted noninterest expense, both as a result of better expense management and the decline in cyclical costs. Further significant credit quality improvement with net charge-offs declining 60% and nonperforming loans down 37% drove marked year-over-year reductions in our provision for credit losses.", "From a revenue perspective, we had a considerable mortgage income headwind. Production in servicing income were down significantly as market conditions changed quickly during the year. In addition, net interest expense -- net interest income declined 5% over the past year due to continued low-rate environment. Despite a very challenging year for revenue, we were able to reduce our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio 350 basis points to 65.8%.", "However, as Aleem noted, we fell short of our target of 65% for the year, given the rapid decline in mortgage revenues. We are still managing to a sub 60% efficiency ratio. And as Aleem articulated, we'll continue to make progress towards that long-term goal in 2014 with the expectation that we'll be below 64% for the full year.", "Further, to reduce uncertainty and improve our overall risk profile, it was important to get key legacy mortgage-related matters behind us as quickly as practical. And we're able to do much of that during 2013, allowing us to more firmly focus on the future of the company and the opportunities we see across all of our businesses. The considerable progress we've made thus far to improve the efficiency of our business, reduce our overall risk profile and deliver improved bottom line performance has translated into better returns for our shareholders. The bottom line is that we're building a more effective and efficient company. I believe we have a strong chassis from which we'll be able to generate further momentum as we look to 2014 and beyond.", "So before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank our teammates for all that they've done and continue to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients and our ongoing drive toward delivering improved performance for our shareholders. So teammates, thank you.", "Well, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and we'll start the Q&A.", "Ankur Vyas", "Great. Thank you, Bill. And Jill, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have our first question, it's from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can we start off with the new efficiency goal for 2014? I think it looks better than some of us were expecting. Can you just give us a little bit more clarity in terms of what you're expecting for revenue growth, particularly fee income? And then on the expense side, I know you're going through the review of the $1.5 billion of expenses. Can you give us a sense of what you're including in your efficiency guidance for that?", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure, Ryan. Well, let me take a crack at that. For overall revenue, as we look at 2014, we actually see several opportunities. First of all, on net interest income with the loan growth that we've delivered and with the momentum that we ended the year on, I think that if we continue to be able to deliver that kind of loan growth, I would expect it to more than offset the margin decline over the course of the year. So I'm looking to actually higher net income in -- net interest income in '14 as a result of loan growth. I think in fee income, we've got lots of opportunities in various areas of the company. And you saw some of that show up in Q4 in our consumer and private wealth business and in the improvements that, I think, we can continue to deliver in CIB. So I'm looking for growth in fee income in those areas. In terms of expenses for the year, you look back at what -- where we were and you remember, we used to have a quarterly expense run rate overall that was always in the sort of $1.5 billion, $1.55 billion range. For '13, what we're able to do is get that number down into the $1.3 billion range. And I like that number a lot better. So as I look into '14, I would think that our expense run rate in 2014 is going to continue to start with a sort of a $1.3 billion number on a quarterly run rate basis.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. Thanks for the clarity, Aleem. And if I could just ask one other question, just in terms of credit, your charge-offs are coming down nicely, but resi is still elevated at 75 basis points. I know you recently noted at our conference that losses on the last 4 years' vintages were 2.5 basis points. So can you just give us a sense of over what timeframe do you think you can get losses in that book down to that sort of a level? And just when I think about the reserve from here at 4x annual charge-offs and you made comments about needing to provide for growth, how do we think about the interplay between charge-offs continuing to come down but needing to provide for new loan growth?", "Thomas E. Freeman", "Yes, I'll take it. It's Tom Freeman. So I think if you take a look, our focus right now is we still have half our portfolio, which are older vintages, half our portfolio, which are newer vintages. The older vintages continued to show improvement in their performance over time. I would think that, that improvement will continue over the next couple of years. I think the noted improvement in the home equities is generally when the home equities had defaulted, we took a 100% loss on the home equities. That is abating. And in fact, as housing prices begin to rally, our loss characteristics are significantly better than that. And just to be really clear, an expectation that we're going to have 2.5 basis point loss profile on that portfolio, I would think, is unreasonably optimistic. But I think the balance will continue to show some improvement over the next year, especially in those 2 areas. And that's it.", "Aleem Gillani", "Ryan, if you think about where we were overall, our over the cycle range for charge-offs, what we're expecting is in the 40 to 70 basis point range. We're now down at the very bottom end of that range. Given the quality of portfolio today, I wouldn't be surprised that we dip below the bottom end of that range temporarily, which is a nice place to be. But also given the solid loan growth that is starting to show up now, I wouldn't be surprised if provisions exceed charge-offs as we look forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "This is actually Bryan in for Ken Usdin. In the fourth quarter, the efficiency ratio was 66.8% and you guys talked about some of the first quarter headwinds, like the increased benefits expense and the impact of day count, NII. So it just seems like to go from close to 67% down to 64% for the full year '14 is pretty aggressive. You guys talked about the NII being up and the fees potentially growing. But what specifically outside of mortgage costs can you do on the expense side to bring the expense base down and hit that 64% ratio?", "Aleem Gillani", "Ken, we've got several things that we're working on outside the mortgage costs, but let's not dismiss the mortgage costs immediately. That's going to be significant. I think we talked about last quarter the idea that we're -- as we're rightsizing that business, we'll be able to take $50 million a quarter out of the run rate on the expense base. And that's what we're expecting for the full year. In 1 quarter, I don't think we're going to get to our target in 1 quarter. And it's, as you pointed out, it's a challenging target. We're not making this easy on ourselves or our teammates. But along with mortgage, we've also talked about our overall ops transformation, our focus on core infrastructure, core operations and thinking that we're going to be able to extract efficiencies from that business. And in addition, we're still making changes in our overall footprint and corporate real estate. And I think we'll be able to take dollars out of that space also. Let me give you one quick example. This weekend, we're moving over 100 teammates in our greater Washington area out of 2 separate buildings and 3 separate floors into sort of 1 common space, where they're going to be able to actually work together, become more effective in the way in which we cover both the business and the personal needs of our corporate client base. But alongside with doing that and making our teammates more productive, we're going to be taking $100,000 a month out of their space bill, out of the rent that we're going to be paying, and that starts next month. So there are lots of opportunities like that, that were focusing on along the way, along with continued dialogue with our suppliers and working with them in partnership to bring down our overall external costs.", "William Henry Rogers", "This is Bill. I think it's important, and you noted it. I mean, it will be bumpy. This isn't -- we're going to be on a trend towards this efficiency ratio, and quarter-to-quarter, we'll be bumpy. But I feel confident that we've got the infrastructure in place, the momentum on both the expense and the revenue side. This is a combination of both to get us there by the end of the year, barring anything highly unusual.", "Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And how should we think about the RidgeWorth sale that's expected to close in the third quarter of '14? What sort of revenue give-ups should we be expecting and how much impact should that have on expenses?", "Aleem Gillani", "Actually, right now, we're thinking that we'll close it in the second quarter, not the third quarter. And if you think about sort of the bottom line benefit of RidgeWorth, as we said in the press release when we announced the transaction, RidgeWorth contributed about $25 million to the bottom line during the first 3 quarters of 2012. So that gives you a sense of the run rate overall coming out of RidgeWorth. And it was sort of slightly decretive to the corporate efficiency ratio.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. And I think given our commitment on the efficiency ratio and given this is a second quarter item, it's a smaller transaction total, this is not the driver of our getting to the efficiency ratio. It's just one small element, in fairness.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "The commercial real estate had some nice growth quarter-to-quarter. And obviously, it's still off of a relatively small number. But could you just talk a bit about the opportunity there? I think you signed a deal with a big insurance company to help source some loans. So what's the opportunity, I guess, both on the lending side and then if there's any fee revenues that could be generated from that arrangement?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. I mean, we've been talking now for several quarters that we sort of turned that inflection point in commercial real estate, where now we're really starting to see core growth. And as you said, albeit on a small basis, the growth is actually pretty significant and an appreciable part of our total growth. And it's -- the good news is it's very diverse. It's sort of from our REIT investments, it's from the things we do in geography, in multifamily, in retail, office, industrial, sort of depending on where any one of those individual markets have opportunity in our institutional market. So it's very diverse in terms of our growth. The deal with MetLife is an important part but not the only part. It represents something like 7% of our total portfolio. So it's what I consider to be maybe 1 of the cylinders of an 8-cylinder engine versus the primary cylinder. And fee business is something that we are driving. I think of our commercial real estate business more like a CIB vertical. So just like we've built up the talent and the capability on the loan origination side, similarly we built up the talent and the capability on the fee-generating side. So in the last quarter, we participated in a lot of deals, led a few related to both equity and debt in the commercial real estate side. And 12 months ago, that number would have been 0. So pretty dramatic improvement on both sides.", "Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then just in terms of how big you're willing to let commercial real estate get, it's about $5 billion right now. How should we think about relative to your overall balance sheet? Understanding that some of these deals can be chunky, how big are you willing to let that get?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. It's a good question. And basically what I tell the teams is, \"Keep growing, and I'll tell you when to stop.\" Because right now, I don't think we're going to run up short-term against the limit. And the way that we're growing the business from diversity in both the size, geography, types of business, I'm not worried about the kind of things that you see in terms of concentration. So I think we're going to let it run a little bit here the next couple of years, and then we'll sort of see where we get to from a total portfolio size. The good news is other parts of our business are growing as well. So its percent of the pie will also be determined by how big the pie gets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Back -- sorry to go back to the expenses again here, but on the -- real just quickly on the other expense line, can you just give us a little bit of color there on what drove the number in the quarter? I think it stayed around similar to last quarter's levels, which I thought were also elevated. So I'm just wondering if that other expense item can come down. And then also on the expense side, in terms of your efficiency target, just wondering if it's still fair to assume that half of the improvement in the efficiency ratio over time here should come from the expenses and while half could come from the top line.", "Aleem Gillani", "I think we had a couple of items that went into that other expense line this quarter that might be a little bit lumpy. And one of those was the point that Bill made in his opening remarks and my point about we had operating and legal costs this quarter that were mortgage-related. So we had an item in there that raised that number slightly higher. But if you think about 2014 overall, there are several numbers in there, several items within that line item that we are focused on that we are attempting to bring down and that I'm optimistic we're going to be able to work on over the course of the year to bring the overall cost down.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on the efficiency ratio target, just if you can give us a little bit of color of how much of that could come from expense reduction and then how much would come from revenue.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. I think the chart we did in the investor presentation hopefully gives a good example of that and where it actually comes from by business. So for example, on the mortgage side, 3/4, we sort of did Harvey Balls, and 3/4 of the effort there will be the expense side. So that will be a lot expense-driven relative to revenue. Wholesale, on the other side, will be much more revenue than expense-driven. I mean, it already operates at a fairly good efficiency ratio, and then in the consumer and private wealth, more balanced. On the private wealth side, more on the revenue side. And on the sort of the core retail side, we still will have some expense opportunities and some revenue. So it's a little more balanced than we've been in the past. And you saw some evidence of that, I think, in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first question is a follow-up to Ryan's line of questioning. Aleem, you mentioned that you're going to start with a $1.3 billion handle on expenses for next -- for this year. And I appreciate that there's going to be some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter, particularly with seasonality and the timing of the mortgage cost coming out. So as I think about modeling for 2014, is $5.2 billion a fair sort of starting point as I think about your expense base for this year for the full year?", "Aleem Gillani", "Erika, I think what I said was that I expect the number to start with a $1.3 billion overall for the year. So yes, there might be some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But I think what I expect is that, that number will have a $1.3 billion every quarter, not necessarily as a starting point. And somewhere in that range, I think, is where we'll end up. And of course, it's revenue-based. So if we do get some revenue increases, that will have some expense implications also.", "William Henry Rogers", "I mean, we're really managing to the efficiency ratio. And I think we're going to monitor closely sort of where we are on the revenue side and where we are on the expense side and adjust accordingly when we have the ability.", "Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And just as a follow-up on that, we appreciate the margin and the NII guidance. I'm just wondering, could we look forward to the margin bottoming in 2014? Or is sort of the -- is there additional pressure from 2015 simply from the swap income continuing to roll off?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think that depends on your view of rates overall. If the curve continues to steepen from here or we get the rate rises that we may get as a result of the Fed's easing coming off in '15, that's certainly going to help the margin from thereon. As you know, the way we're structured is we'll benefit much more as a company, given our balance sheet structure, if short rates start to go up. And if the Fed does start to bring short rates up in '15, that will really help us from a net interest income perspective, given the way our balance sheet is structured now. Additionally, your point about the swap income rolling off, Erika, as that happens at the end of '14 and into '15, we will start to get much more asset-sensitive. And if short rates start to move up in '15 as we currently think they might, that will benefit us considerably at that point.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can you guys share with us -- when you look at your Tier 1 common ratio now at about 9.6% and if you say regional banks like your own are required to carry 7%, obviously you're going to want to carry a cushion above that. Philosophically, in the future, because I think return of capital is going to be important for valuations, where do you guys think you want to keep your Tier 1 common ratio if you're required again to have a 7% number plus some cushion?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I guess, first of all, the first question, Gerard, is how big is that cushion. And as you know, we're still -- the industry is still looking for some guidance from the regulators as to what that G-SIB and domestic SIFI cushion is going to be. So if you start with 7%, as you're starting with, to begin with, you add some type of SIFI cushion on top of that, a SIFI requirement on top of that. I'm not sure exactly yet what that's going to be. But looking at where the overall G-SIB requirements are, that kind of number might be on the order of 50 to 75 basis points. And then of course, our board is going to want to make sure that we have a cushion on top of that to make sure that we don't fall south of the regulatory required number. So at the end of the day, if you put all those together, having a number that starts with an 8% overall, I don't think, is unfair. But where we sit within that and what type of additional cushion we're going to have on top of that at this point is still a little bit unclear.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "There hasn't -- it doesn't seem to be much discussion lately of the domestic SIFI number. Obviously, SLR [ph] has taken over. But are you guys still hearing from the regulators that there is going to be a domestic SIFI buffer?", "Aleem Gillani", "At this point, Gerard, I just don't know. Obviously, they've started at the global level with the G-SIBs. But to the extent that they decide there's going to be a domestic SIFI number, given the size of our company, I could envision a day where they say all banks above $50 billion in assets are structurally important.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then philosophically, once you get to the desired levels and you are maybe above what you think is you need, could you guys conceptually -- or assuming the regulators would allow it, would you ever consider giving back 100% of your earnings in a form of obviously dividends and share repurchases?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, the first and best use of our capital, I think, is using it by doing client business. So to the extent that we're able to grow our business and meet more client needs, that will be the first call in our capital. I'm actually pretty happy with this quarter and the way in which we were able to use 0.1% of our overall capital ratio to grow client business and do real loans. So that would be the first call in our business. If we aren't able to get client growth and real growth, then we'll look at other opportunities to deploy that capital. But hopefully, that's not the number one thing we're going to look at.", "Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then my second just follow-up question, on your commercial real estate business, the success that you're having, obviously we know about the residential markets have recovered or are recovering. What do you guys see in the commercial real estate, whether it's office buildings, suburban office or industrial space? In your footprint, is there meaningful improvement in those markets, like we're seeing in residential markets?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. I think it's by market. You would see an individual one of those segments improving, and we'll look at it by market. And we're not limited to just our geography. I mean, this is going to -- this is a business that has a lot of diversity. So if you look within our geography and you look nationally, multifamily has certainly been one of those areas that has responded more quickly. But in certain places, we're already worried about some overheating. And in those areas, we'll not be as aggressive as we'll be in other areas. Office and industrial, probably a little bit ahead. Retail is probably slow, particularly in our markets. I think you have to say existing centers are doing better, so that's good news. But you don't see a lot of new retail yet. I think that will be probably the last one to come back.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners.", "Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Bill and Aleem, I was curious on the issue of loan paydowns and to what extent that could be a positive influencer to loan growth in 2014.", "Aleem Gillani", "Loan paydowns, Chris? Help me understand your question.", "Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division", "Paydowns, payoffs of loans as you look to the portfolio.", "William Henry Rogers", "Real slowing.", "Aleem Gillani", "Slowing? Yes, well, that started to show up in Q4. We started to see that with the increase in rates both our direct clients and then also through the securities portfolio, as paydowns slowed, the effects of that, as you saw in our margin, was actually to reduce the premium amortization in the securities book. And as the duration of our assets extended a little bit, the benefit of that was an increase in yield and an increase in overall income. So as one driver of our overall growth in assets and growth in loans, that was certainly one of them.", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. And I think you see that on the loan side of that most acutely in the home equity portfolio. It's about a $14 billion portfolio for that, that has been attriting pretty consistently, and that's reaching an inflection point. And actually the production of home equity has been good to exceptionally good. We'll start to see some more organic growth as that attrition stops.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "On mortgage volumes, I guess, one of the things I'm scratching my head on is you guys were down by about I think it was 50% linked quarter. The MBA has down 25% or so linked quarter. But if I look at Chase, if I look at BofA, if I look at Wells, they're all down roughly the same as you. I mean, I think the range is 38% to 52%. So I mean, is there some evidence of a big transfer of market share to small banks and nonbanks? Or are we all just working off the wrong market size? And if it's the latter, is there any evidence of -- does it feel like some volume was just pushed from 4Q to 1Q because the holidays and stuff like? Or does it just feel like maybe the market was estimated too big?", "William Henry Rogers", "No. I think let me try to take a shot at this. If you look at us and you saw some of the amount of refinance we had in our portfolio, this is really sort of a refinance backlog in the second quarter. If you look at us in the third quarter, you'd sort of say we were higher. So those questions would have come the other way, so you guys looked like you were higher than everybody else. And now that's sort of run its course. That's sort of run itself through. And so you see that as a comparison then about a little bit higher third quarter to the little bit lower fourth quarter in terms of decrease in production. I think on the market share issue, it's actually the opposite of what you suggested. We're seeing -- we look at that fairly carefully. And in the places where we want to maintain and the places where we want to grow our market share, I feel actually fairly good about that. And in our markets, going forward, we see that purchase market coming back. This is always the hardest on time to talk about it because you're in that first quarter, and it's way down, always down when it's a traditional cyclical market. The second, third quarters can be as high as double of what they are when you start the year. But the traditional purchase market, I think, sort of plays into our brand. We've been a traditional purchase bank. We don't have to reintroduce ourselves to realtors. We don't have to reintroduce ourselves to centers of influence. This is a business that we've done well before and we have maintained to grow our market share.", "Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP", "That's very helpful. On kind of some of the profitability goals, clearly the focus right now is getting to where you want to be on efficiency. If I'm reading the proxy right, which is a big if, it seems like a 1% ROA is a pretty important goal in 2015 for some of the incentive plans. And I wonder if you could just talk about as you look beyond this efficiency push, is it going to be more of an ROA focus from kind of 2015 and beyond? Is 1% kind of what you're thinking of as a normal level or just a stepping stone? And I guess, within that, does the 1% in your view require a change in the environment, better growth, higher rates? Or is 1% an ROA that you think you can get to over time even if we stay in this very low-rate, sluggish environment?", "William Henry Rogers", "Yes. I mean, I think you read the proxy correctly. And the -- we talk a lot about the efficiency ratio, but I don't want you to think that's sort of the exclusive North Star. I mean, we are managing the company to be great stewards of the assets. And you've seen, as we talk about the efficiency ratio, you've also seen the improvement in the ROA, not the least of which was this quarter, sort of significant improvement in ROA. And that's been pretty consistent across this pattern. So while I put that hard stake in the efficiency ratio, I can assure you that it is consistent, I believe, with also growing the ROA of the business in the way that we're accomplishing the efficiency ratio target. So I think we have a business that over several years can be a north of 1% ROA business. And clearly, that line was put in the sand. I don't think it's totally rate-dependent. But certainly, rates over that period would expedite the ability to get to that goal.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Aleem, I want to talk to you a little about your repositioning of the balance sheet, allowing the swaps to run off. Can you give us a feel for the magnitude of the increase in asset sensitivity you're trying to accomplish and kind of what are the parameters that would make you want to stop doing -- create more of a balanced approach if you thought the rate increase was going to be later?", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, that's a great question. Let me just step back and look back a little bit. The way we got here is that over the last few years coming into this, we've been more liability-sensitive. And as short-term rates were declining, as rates were declining overall, being liability-sensitive, looking back, looks like it was the right thing to do. Over the last 18 months or so, I'd characterize our position really as being more generally neutral. We've turned from being liability-sensitive to slightly liability-sensitive to being essentially neutral to now being slightly asset-sensitive but within a neutral band. So we're preparing for a move in rates, but I don't think it's going to occur immediately. We saw the curve steepen, and we saw long-term rates go up, but we really haven't seen short-term rates go up at all. And I don't expect, Marty, that short-term rates are going to move up in 2014 at all. So we're not preparing ourselves to get significantly asset-sensitive this year. If it happens, that's great. We're slightly positioned and we will benefit from that. But I'm actually not expecting that in '14. So what we're doing is we're turning the balance sheet slightly and over time to prepare for a secular change. And if in 2015 the Fed acts and starts to move up short-term rates, we'll be prepared for that when that happens. And the big benefit, I think, will come both in the rate move and in the way we're structured in '15. But I wouldn't expect to see much of a change in our overall structure in '14 or much of a change in short-term rates either.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And Bill, as we're seeing the loan growth starting to kind of pick up, the side effect of that is what we're seeing in investment banking revenues and the fee income. So as the economy takes hold, we are looking at a different competitive environment. So I just thought if you could talk a little bit about how you think the benefit as you're hitting each year's sequential records in investment banking because it's kind of volatile and lumpy, so it's hard to kind of depend on it. But over time, you should see the benefit of being able to play a bigger part in that market.", "William Henry Rogers", "I feel like you've asked and answered the question. But I'll take a swing because I think your supposition is exactly right. And it's predicated, as you know, about our businesses that we're building an investment banking business, not separate from our franchise but attached to our franchise. So the asset growth is very much tied into the fee growth. And although it's lumpy, if you look at the last 3 quarters, investment banking revenue was above $90 million for 3 quarters. I can remember not too many years ago, that was the annual production in that business. So tied into the ROA question earlier is these things are linked. We really -- we look at every asset we put on the books and we look at its fee opportunity. And certainly, in the commercial and up category, it's tied in to the investment banking opportunity as a big part of that discussion and dialogue.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And how would you just characterize the change in the competitive environment that gives you this opportunity?", "William Henry Rogers", "Well, I mean, it's very competitive. So I don't want to pull any punches on the competitiveness of the environment. I think just from our perspective, the skill and the capability and the talent that we've been building over the last 5 years is just starting to pay dividends. So it's selective, it's opportunistic and, I think, unique to some of the skill and the capabilities that we've built over the last several years.", "Ankur Vyas", "All right. This concludes our call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today.

At this time, all lines have been placed on listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. (Operator Instructions) This call is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations' section of the website.", "I know some of you had some trouble accessing the IR portion of our website this morning; we're looking to resolve it as soon as possible. In the meantime, however, you could access the deck and the press release which has been filed as an 8-K with the SEC.", "With me today, among other members of our Executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP in our press release and on our website at www.suntrust.com.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Rogers Jr.", "Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone. In typical fashion, I will begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for details on the results. I'll then spend some time reviewing our performance at the business segment level.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.73 on net income to common of $393 million. This represents a 16% increase from the first quarter of last year. We had solid performance in several areas including strong loan growth, effective expense management, and further improved asset quality.", "Revenue was seasonally lower relative to prior quarter and down versus the prior year due to the marked decline in mortgage refinance activity that began last summer.", "Looking at the component parts, net interest income and margin were down slightly relative to the fourth quarter and non-interest income was seasonally lower.", "A more telling story I think emerges when you look at the year-over-year results. We generated solid growth across most of our non-interest income categories, notably in investment banking and wealth management, where we've made incremental investments to help drive growth. The exception is the decline in refinance activity which impacted our mortgage production income.", "Expenses were relatively stable to the fourth quarter with reductions in most categories offsetting the seasonal increase in personnel expense. This was the combined result of our concerted effort toward driving efficiency improvements as well as further contraction in our cyclical costs.", "Average performing loans increased 2% sequentially driven by targeted growth within our C&I, commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. Average client deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter with the favorable mix shift continuing.", "Credit quality continues to improve; non-performing loans were down 5% from the prior quarter and 37% from last year; the net charge-off ratio declined five basis points from the prior quarter to 35 basis points. Lastly, our capital position remains solid with Tier-1 common estimated to be 9.9% on a Basel I basis and 9.7% for Basel III.", "As you're aware, the capital plan we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process was not objected to by the Federal Reserve. This included increasing the return of capital to our shareholders in the form of a higher quarterly stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.20 per share and the repurchase of up to $450 million worth of our stock during the upcoming four quarters. We're obviously pleased that our capital position and improved earnings enabled these actions.", "We generated solid momentum in our businesses, but some of it is masked by broader industry headwinds including the persistently low rate environment and a rapid decline in home refinance activity.", "However, our markets are exhibiting favorable macroeconomic trends and housing continues to improve. Furthermore, we're continuing to make targeted investments in our businesses to drive growth as we move beyond the challenging revenue environment.", "So, let me turn it over to Aleem.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share this quarter were $0.73, which was 16% higher than EPS in the prior year and $0.04 lower compared to the prior quarter.", "The sequential quarter decrease was driven by lower revenue primarily due to the lower day count negatively impact net interest income and the normal non-interest income seasonality given lower transaction volumes in certain fee categories in the first quarter.", "The year-over-year 16% increase was driven by reductions in provision and credit-related expenses, which were partially offset by a significant drop in mortgage production income. In addition, the lower effective tax rate this quarter, which was favorably impacted by certain discrete items, also contributed to the year-over-year EPS increase.", "Let's review the underlying trends in more detail starting on slide five. Both net interest income and the net interest margin declined slightly compared to the prior quarter. Net interest margin was down one basis point due to continued loan yield compression. And net interest income declined $8 million primarily as a consequence of having two fewer days in the first quarter.", "Compared to the first quarter of 2013, net interest income and net interest margin were both negatively impacted by declining loan yields and lower commercial loan swap income, partially offset by higher securities yields and lower deposit costs. In addition, net interest income benefited from the 7% average performing loan growth experienced over the past year.", "Looking forward, we would expect the net interest margin to decline further throughout 2014, primarily due to compression in loan yields and lower commercial loan swap income. We continue to expect full year 2014 net interest margin to decline compared to 2013 albeit at a modestly slower pace than the 2013 versus 2012 decline.", "You will recall that as our commercial loan swaps mature, we become more asset sensitive, which is a conscious design of our balance sheet management strategy over the medium term.", "Moving on to slide six, adjusted non-interest income was lower by $18 million, primarily driven by normal seasonal fee income trends between the fourth and first quarter. Service charges for deposits declined $10 million sequentially, primarily due to seasonality and fewer business days in the first quarter, as well as lower incidence rates.", "Investment banking income had a strong quarter though revenues were down modestly from the high level of deal activity that occurred in the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, investment banking revenues were up $20 million due to growth across a number of product areas. Trading income was down $8 million sequentially, though entirely driven by a $13 million increase in mark-to-market losses on our fair value debt.", "Excluding the impact of fair value items, core trading income was essentially flat. Mortgage servicing income increased $16 million relative to the prior quarter, due to lower decay in the MSR asset, which was the result of lower refinance activity and positive net hedge performance.", "Mortgage production income increased $12 million sequentially due to a lower mortgage repurchase provision and higher fair value gains, which were partially offset by lower origination fees. Gain on sale was generally stable as slightly higher margins offset slightly lower LOC volume.", "Retail investment services continued its positive trend, resulting from our ongoing focus on meeting more clients' wealth and investment needs. However, other non-interest income declined $17 million sequentially as a result of gains realized on certain asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income fell $86 million, primarily due to lower mortgage production income which resulted from both lower gain on sale margins and lower production volume.", "Excluding mortgage production income we had solid year-over-year growth in noninterest income due to increases in investment banking, wealth management and mortgage servicing.", "Let's move to expenses on slide seven. Reported non-interest expense was generally stable compared to the prior quarter and prior year. Personnel expense increased $77 million sequentially, primarily driven by the anticipated seasonal increase in benefits expense and FICA-related costs.", "Cyclical costs improved, both sequentially and compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower expenses associated with legacy mortgage and legal matters, and continued improvements in the overall asset quality of our loan portfolio.", "We would not anticipate further improvements in cyclical costs for first quarter levels, particularly given the current low levels of OREO and credit services cost. Other expense categories generally experienced modest reductions when compared to the prior quarter.", "We incurred a $36 million charge this quarter related to the impairment of certain legacy affordable housing assets. This charge has no impact to our core affordable housing and community development business, which continues to grow and invest within the communities we serve.", "In addition, this quarter, we adopted new accounting guidance, ASU 2014-01 that resulted in the amortization of certain affordable housing investments moving from the non-interest expense line to the tax line. This adoption has no impact to bottom line net income or earnings per share, and prior periods have been restated accordingly.", "As you can see on slide eight, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved slightly relative to the fourth quarter as the reduction in adjusted expenses more than offset the modest revenue decline.", "We continue to target an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of less than 64% for 2014, and this quarter's performance is supportive of that goal. Our long term efficiency ratio target continues to be below 60%.", "Turning to credit quality on slide nine. Asset quality continued to improve this quarter with the net charge-off ratio declining from 40 basis points to 35 basis points. Non-performing loans were also lower, improving by 5% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Both the declines in net charge-offs and non-performing loans were driven by improvements in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolio.", "The improvement in asset quality also drove slight declines in the allowance and the allowance for loan and lease loss ratio. The loan loss provision was generally stable, as improvements in asset quality were offset by loan growth in the quarter.", "Going forward, we would expect continued, but modest improvements in non-performing loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. We also would expect net charge-offs in the residential portfolio to drift modestly lower in the near-term. However, commercial and consumer net charge-offs are already at or below normal levels.", "In addition, as we have experienced in the past two quarters, positive loan growth may offset future asset quality improvement and does impact sequential changes in the loan-loss provision.", "Turning to balance sheet trends on slide 10. Average performing loans increased by $2.9 billion or about 2%. Growth was broad-based across most portfolios, but principally driven by C&I, CRE and Consumer. C&I loan growth was driven by the commercial auto dealer growth, the corporate banking expansion initiatives we began last year and broad-based growth across most CIB industry verticals. Average CRE loans were up 11% sequentially due to growth in our institutional business, success in our REIT platform and the portfolio acquisition.", "Lastly, average consumer loans were also up modestly, given growth in our indirect auto, credit card and LightStream businesses, which were partially offset by a slight decline in our home equity portfolio.", "Relative to the prior year, average performing loans increased $8.2 billion or 7%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. We're doing our part to support our clients and grow the economy.", "Overall, loan growth was solid this quarter as we continue to execute across targeted growth initiatives and the economic indicators in our markets continue to improve.", "Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter and the first quarter of 2013, as growth in low-cost deposits was partially offset by a lower amount of high cost time deposits. This continued favorable shift in deposit mix helped move interest-bearing deposit costs down by one and six basis points respectively, compared to the prior quarter and prior year.", "Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Tier 1 common equity expanded by approximately $300 million as a result of growth in retained earnings. Our key capital ratios increased slightly as the growth in retained earnings more than offset our loan growth.", "In addition, tangible book value per share increased 3% from the prior quarter, also due to growth in retained earnings.", "As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2014 CCAR process. Capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $450 million over the coming year and increases our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.20, subject to Board approval.", "With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Okay. Thanks, Aleem. The core operating momentum generated in each of our business segments helped drive the overall solid corporate results we discussed this morning. I'll start with consumer banking and private wealth management business, where net income was up 14% over last year. Strong retail investment income growth more than offset decline from service charges.", "In addition, provision for credit losses decreased meaningfully as credit quality improved, driven by home equity given the improved housing market. Further, consumer loan production was up 17% over last year, which helped offset legacy asset runoff.", "We made a lot of progress in this business over the last several quarters. We've significantly increased our investment in digital to meet our client needs, and this has helped us to create a more efficient branch network and staffing model.", "Going forward, you can expect continued rationalization with additional net reductions in our branch network; however, at a slower rate than what we accomplished over the past couple of years, particularly given the importance of a branch and client acquisition and account opening.", "We're also making investments to grow revenue in this business. For example, we've made investments most notably in talent in our wealth management related businesses to help us meet more of our client needs, wealth and investment needs.", "We've seen good early returns here with wealth management related non-interest income in this segment up 10% year-over-year. Low interest rates and consumer fee environment continue to place challenges on revenue growth; however, we feel good about the long-term overall momentum we're generating in this business.", "Now, let's take our closer look at a wholesale. Our wholesale business is affected by seasonality when comparing the current quarter to the fourth, specifically, our investment banking business. The strong operating trends are evident when you look at results compared to last year.", "Pre-tax income excluding the $36 million affordable housing impairment was up 10% year-over-year. Non-interest income grew 5% over the prior year, primarily driven by investment banking wherein we had strong growth in our syndications, M&A advisory and equity related businesses.", "Net interest income increased 4% due to robust loan and deposit growth. Now this growth was partially offset by continuing declines in loan yields.", "The pace of wholesale loan growth continued as average loans grew $2.6 billion or 5% from last quarter. Loan growth was broad-based led by further growth in CRE and our commercial dealer group along with our large corporate lending areas, most notably our energy and financial technology verticals.", "Overall, our pipelines continue to be healthy giving us confidence on wholesale loan growth prospects in 2014. Competition, however, remains high, which may lead to ongoing pricing pressure for us and the industry.", "We continue to make investments in the business to better meet an array of our clients' needs and augment our capabilities. A recent example is our acquisition of an advisory company to the energy business, where we will now be able to complement our existing corporate finance capabilities with their underlying assets expertise.", "Looking at the remainder of 2014, we are optimistic about the prospects of our Wholesale business, as we improved share and better leverage the full platform of our product capabilities for more of our client base.", "Now, let's take a look at mortgage. In October of last year, we outlined our intent to reduce core expenses by approximately $50 million a quarter or 20% by the second quarter of this year. We're pleased to report that we've achieved this objective one quarter early and doing so help drive the bottom line performance of our Mortgage business into the black.", "Taking a closer look at revenue, non-interest income was up sequentially with both servicing income and production income expanding. Origination volume was down, but that was offset by a lower mortgage repurchase provision, our fair value gains and increased servicing income.", "All-in, gain on sale margins were generally stable compared to prior quarter. And as I said on the expense side, we were successful on our cost-saving efforts and that along with lower cyclical cost drove a 27% sequential decline in expenses.", "Provision declines continued given the ongoing improvement in the credit quality of the residential mortgage portfolio, which also helped drive improved performance in this business.", "Returning the Mortgage segment to profitability was a step in the right direction, but we know we have more to do to generate sustained profitability. On a near term basis, we anticipate an increase in production volume as we enter the spring/summer selling season, and inventory in some of our markets is tight and that could delay some of the recovery.", "So, net-net, we are positive about the direction we are taking our businesses and their ability to generate profitable growth, particularly as the operating environment for the industry improves and we are able to more fully realize the returns on the targeted investments that we've been making.", "So, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you to begin the Q&A.", "Ankur Vyas", "Great. Thanks, Bill. Jane, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions)", "Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Morning, Ryan.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning, Ryan.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "When I think about the expense base, it clearly came in better than I think a lot of us would have expected. So, when we look out, how much of the $77 million of the incentive comp was seasonal, i.e. how much that to you expect to leave the run rate in 2Q?", "As you think about just the trajectory of the expense base over the remainder of the year, I know you guys are doing 1.5 billion review with the back office, do you think expenses should continue to trend lower? Should we see a downward bias from here?", "Aleem Gillani", "Ryan, it's Aleem. Why don't I start that off with the first piece? The $77 million increase wasn't all the incentive comp, that was total comp. And the majority of that, when you look at salaries, salaries were the same quarter-over-quarter. A good portion of that actually resulted from employee benefits.", "For example, our FICA taxes went up by $35 million this quarter and that's typically just a Q1 event, and rolls back after that. So I would expect a good portion of that $77 million to roll back into the bottom line starting in Q2.", "However, when we think about our total performance, we actually don't think about dollar expenses alone, we think about them in the context of our overall efficiency ratio. And if we do get revenue growth, I wouldn't be surprised to see some expense increase come along with our revenue growth.", "But as you know, we are focused very much on that efficiency ratio. Our adjusted number, as you saw, was 64.9% in the first quarter. For us to get to our target of under 64% this year, we are going to have to continue to fight to bring that down. So in the context of our overall efficiency, I would think about our expenses declining as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of the year.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And just in terms of getting to below the 64%, as you think about the components of that, will more of that need to come from the revenue side relative to the expense from here? I guess, related to that Bill, I know it is still early days in terms of thinking out to next year.", "But clearly, there is a big falloff from the commercial loan swap income as we think into next year. Can we continue to see efficiency improvement in light of the revenue headwind that you'll have next year?", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Yeah, let me sort of start with this year, maybe sort of embellish a little bit on what Aleem was saying is and focus again continuing to be on that efficiency ratio and the components of revenue expense. I think we outlined sort of in each of our business, as you probably have a little bit of a different focus.", "Now, for example, in Wholesale, we're just trying to generalize, you know, about three quarters of our focus is on revenue and about a quarter is on the expense side, and mortgage would sort of be the counter opposite of that and the consumer and private wealth would sort of be more equally balanced.", "So, in each of our businesses and everything that we're doing, we're trying to reach that right balance of making the investments, recognizing that revenues going to have to be a bigger part of this going forward, but also recognizing that we still have some expense opportunities. And you see that manifest itself, for example, in the Mortgage side of this quarter.", "Looking out to next year, what I would say is, we're not backing off our guidance to getting to below 60% efficiency ratio. That will obviously be dictated by time, but I am very confident that we'll have an environment that we can achieve that.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Hi, Matt.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Just following up on the revenue question, as we think about net interest income dollars from here, should we expect them to grow? I know you mentioned the NIM will continue to be under pressure, but what about the net interest income dollars?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think we've been able to show a little bit of that over the last couple of quarters, Matt, as our net interest income dollars have been sort of generally stable despite a declining NIM overall.", "So, we've been able to get some good loan growth over the last few quarters. We're seeing slightly improved confidence amongst our clients. We're able to do more client business over the last few quarters.", "So if that continues and we continue to get that loan growth, then yes, I am looking to see net interest income dollars start to grow with loan growth more than offsetting the effect of declining NIM.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "And, Matt, right now as it relates to sort of a future loan growth, I mean, your crystal ball is short by nature, but our pipelines continue to be healthy, I mean they are up 10% of where they were last year. Our unfunded availability is up by more than that. So, some of the leading indicators as it relates to loan growth continue to be good.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just separately as we think about the cyclical costs or the environmental expenses, you said they wouldn't come down from this level, but obviously the roughly $170 million annualizes well below your $325 million target? Can we stay relatively close to these levels or how should we think about the trajectory of those environmental costs?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think overall when you look at the composition of these costs, some of these costs are made up of things like their credit services and OREO. Credit services is down because mortgage production is down. That's the biggest component of that piece.", "So that will follow where mortgage production goes. OREO overall is down about as low as it can be. I think it was pretty close to zero for the year last year. So, over time, you would expect that that's going to drift up a little bit, but collection services will probably drift down a little bit.", "So, when I look at the composition of that number, and you are right, we had additional -- we had guided some time ago to a number that would be below $325 million annualized, we're now about half of that number on an annualized basis. I don't see it going much lower than here, Matt.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. But it sounds like ex-higher mortgage production, which should lead to higher revenue if that occurs, if we take out the credit services piece, the other two might net itself out?", "Aleem Gillani", "Those two components I think will net themselves out. There is the fourth component to that piece, of course, which is operating losses and operating losses are lumpy and somewhat out of our control. So, excluding those exogenous shocks, I think then your premise is correct.", "Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That was helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies", "Guys, I want to just follow-up on the path of net interest income and asset sensitivity to your points about -- obviously we know about this step down next year. So, can you talk us through, first of all, as we get through next year, does the path continue to run down through the year on the slide you show the average?", "And then how do we know when you are at that point where you are comfortable with the magnitude of how asset sensitive the balance sheet ends up post that runoff?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think our comfort with our level of asset sensitivity, ken, will depend a little bit on the interest rate environment or primarily on the interest rate environment at that time. We had set up a structure for asset sensitivity that allowed us to become more asset sensitive as we thought that time was going to be right for the economy to start to grow once again.", "Looking at that general structure, I still think we sort of generally have that right and we are becoming more asset sensitive just about the right time when most people expect rates are going to start to go up.", "So, we'll adjust that over time as we have continued to do, but as we adjust it and we'll be adjusting it based on what we think the economy looks like and the path of rates looks like at that time. Does that make sense?", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies", "Yeah. And then to the second question, just about your goal that you would set out for next year and Bill to your point earlier about potentially reaching 60% efficiency ratio next year. Again, just to elaborate if you could just about the balance of needing to see revenue growth versus needing to see cost reduction in terms of you are seeing out that far out, what gives you the confidence? What pieces give you the confidence that you can see unfolding?", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "I want to make sure that I didn't say 60% next year. So that's our long-term goal and my confidence still remains that we've got right plans in place and infrastructure and management focus and business and environment that we can get there. But the length of time and when we get there is going to be economic dependent and somewhat interest rate dependent.", "As I have said before, we're highlighting the focus in each of our businesses related to sort of overall expense focus and overall revenue focus and it's just got to continue to be a balance. And hopefully, we have articulated the fact that we've got a lot of intensity and investment on the revenue side and we have got good momentum on there. But very similarly continued focus on the expense side and, again, hopefully highlighted by this quarter.", "When we started this endeavor on the expense side, our quarterly expense run rate was about $1 billion -- a little over $1.5 billion, and now we are sort of hovering at a number that's a little bit below $1.4 billion. So we are getting sort of a permanent structure and I would expect that net of revenue investments that will continue to track down.", "Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities", "Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get a little more detail in terms of your thinking about future commercial real estate growth that was as you mentioned augmented little bit by an acquisition in the quarter, but even excluding that it looked relatively strong.", "Just trying to get a better sense as to where you're seeing strength and potentially what markets or what products might be areas that you think are getting a little overheated?", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Yes, I mean the good news is that it's pretty broad-based. So that's a good news and we had a chance to really think through our commercial real estate strategy going forward, the focus was to have a very diversified portfolio not only from a product set, but also from a geographic set. So that was -- that's what we said out and we're seeing that.", "So while we've seen some office expansion as an example, that's one of the opportunities that's been in larger cities with sort of good underlying prospects, we've seen growth in the REIT side, we've seen growth in the institutional side and we're starting to see, within our own markets, which is positive. We're starting to see some of that recovery in virtually all categories multifamily, industrial, little less office, retail, clearly, on the bottom of that food group in terms of recovery. So it's pretty broad-based.", "In terms of what's soft, we look at that from a, let's call it, a heat-map perspective. So while we may be investing in multifamily in some of our markets, and other of our markets, we wouldn't be. Office sort of very similar, industrial very similar, and as I mentioned earlier, probably the one that's lagging probably more universally is retail and we'll be cautious about that coming out of the cycle.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities", "Sure. Understood. Then Aleem, I guess, a question for you on the mortgage expenses. Obviously, you met your $50 million cost reduction target a bit early, but if I look at the numbers in terms of the Mortgage business unit, it looks like core expenses there were down about 21% quarter-over-quarter.", "Sorry, costs were down 27%. Originations were down little over 20%. But on a year-over-year basis, originations were down about 65% with costs down 30%. I guess my point is or my question is, are there further opportunities for rightsizing the fixed cost in that business? Or do you think you are pretty much where you need to be?", "Aleem Gillani", "That's a good question, Matt, thank you. We've actually, I think, taken -- obviously the variable costs have been coming out over time with a little bit of a lag, and you've been seeing that. As you know, we've been working hard to take fixed costs out of the system also. We've taken a lot of those out, but I think we still have some additional opportunities to take out fixed costs out of the system.", "Although from here at this level, obviously, there is less opportunity for us to take more out. We do have some plans. We do have some other things that we're working on, and over the course of the remainder of this year, we'll be trying to take out fixed cost little by little out of that system.", "Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Murray with ISI. Your line is open.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Just ask you a hypothetical. If -- let's say for argument sake, revenue stayed flat sequentially next quarter, could the expense run rate go below $1.3 billion?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, that's a tough question. We've been thinking about our expense rate, Keith, in the context of a number that starts with a $1.3 billion, somewhere between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. As Bill said a minute ago, if you look at 2011, 2012, we are running about $1.550 billion, we are now about $1.350 billion.", "So we've taken $200 million a quarter out of our run rate and we think we've taken about as much out as we can, that's not to say we can't find individual opportunities from here and we are going to be continuing to do that. I would be thinking about if revenues stay exactly where they are that our expense base would still start with a $1.3 billion. Now perhaps it would be lower in that range, but it would start with a $1.3 billion.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Remember, maybe sort of -- you gave a quarter hypothetical, I mean remember we are sort of in a seasonally low as it relates to a lot of our businesses. So, remember investment banking for the first quarter was seasonally low, so we'd expect that to be better in the second quarter.", "Mortgage clearly is seasonally low, we'd expect the spring season to sort of get up and going and expect some increases there. And then low day count on the Consumer side which won't be the same thing in the quarter.", "But I would say sort of broadly and the reason we are talking so much about the efficiency ratio and if we see revenues staying flat for a really, really long period of time then we are going to continue to drive down on the expense side. I mean we're just would not throwing in the towel on this long-term objective in our business model of getting to sub-60% efficiency ratio.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Fair enough. And then, it looks like your fees to average loan service for others jumped a bit this quarter. Just curious what drove that and how high can that fee go?", "Aleem Gillani", "Fees, you mean in the mortgage side?", "Keith Murray - ISI", "In the mortgage business, yeah, it looked like you went to 21 bps from 14 bps.", "Aleem Gillani", "I wouldn't expect that to go much higher from here.", "Keith Murray - ISI", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And good morning everyone.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Good morning.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Just had a follow-up question around the strong commercial real estate loan growth you've been generating. And I wanted to take a step back and think about what type of ROEs you are generating now really relative to the peak of 2009, 2010, also to the value of sort of pre-crisis 2007. How do you think about that? And maybe even comment on differences in funding costs, NIE and credit cost expectations?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Craig, let me start that off. Overall, when I think about our ROEs and -- well, perhaps I should start with ROAs in that business. ROAs overall I think are a little bit lower than we would like them to be now. And that's a function of all of the liquidity and all of the competition that exists for that business.", "And when I talk about ROAs, I'm talking about that in the context of just the loan -- just on balance sheet business. What we're trying to do is supplement ROEs overall by doing other business with those clients and trying to make those relationships not just lending relationships, but doing some of the other business that they need and having SunTrust become one of their financial services suppliers across a broad variety of products.", "So, I think we're starting out in that business as we are growing, with lower ROAs than I would like from pure lending. But we're working to supplement the overall ROEs with additional business.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "And maybe if you sort of drew a comparison to the past of that is we didn't have a capital markets capability in CRE in the past. So, I like to think about this business as basically thinking about it like an industry vertical within our corporate investment banking businesses.", "And we have a lot of investment that we have made on both the debt and equity side in addition to investments we have made on the treasury management side. So, our ability to generate ROA and ROE in addition to the loan product, we just have the capability now that we just didn't have before. So, it's sort of a fundamentally different business.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. And just a follow-up here. With your portfolio loan yield now in the Siri book of 2.93%, I'm just wondering what was the loan yield on the new business generated in the first quarter. And if you have any commentary around LTVs or terms, that would be helpful too.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Well, I think when we look at loan yields overall, we sort of segregate that business-by-business. So, when you are looking at the wholesale business, in the wholesale business new loans that were coming on within CIB and up at sort of the top end of our client base are coming on with a two handle. And then down into the commercial and business banking space, those loans that are coming on are coming on now with a 3 handle.", "And then if you look at the LTVs to the portfolios where that's most relevant, sort of the consumer portfolio and the commercial real estate portfolio, when you think about them, on the consumer side, I mean, the credit quality continues to be really good. The LTVs are pretty consistently positive, so we haven't seen significant really any deterioration on the consumer side.", "And then on the commercial real estate side, Aleem's comment was right, I mean we're frustrated by some of the pricing that's out there, but the structure stayed okay. And similarly, we haven't seen sort of massive change in LTV in that portfolio.", "Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse", "All right, great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks very much. So, a quick follow-up on the LTVs for CRE is up. Should we assume you're running at about like 65% to 70%?", "Thomas E. Freeman", "It depends on the -- its Tom Freeman, it depends on the individual products set. In the institutional area, I think it's better than that. In the individual project finance, probably in the 70% range is about right in construction loan probably a little higher than that.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And better means like lower, right?", "Thomas E. Freeman", "It does to me.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "I just want to make sure. Okay. And then just my other question was on the LCR, we've heard from a couple of other institutions this quarter around what they are kind of triangulating to and how long it's going to take to get there?", "Just wondering if you can give us a sense to where you are today and what kind of cushion you think you need to run with and how long it takes to get there. And does it have any indication for NIM or asset sensitivity as you transition towards where you need to be?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I wish I knew exactly where we did need to be, we are waiting on those final rules. But we're moving now. We're already transitioning rather than waiting for the final rules to come out. We'll have -- we'll be above where we need to be by year end. I'd say, we're not quite today where we need to be, but by the time the rules come out and by the time they become effective December 31 this year, we'll be running at above 80%.", "We're determining what kind of cushion we need to have and that probably we'll need to be running at about a 10% cushion above that number. So I wouldn't be surprised to see us and the industry have some kind of cushion, and I would be thinking about that in the context of 10% or so soon after year-end.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Where ever you are today relative to the 80% to 90% that you are expecting to be at is embedded in the NIM guidance that you gave us and the asset sensitivity?", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Yes, it is.", "Aleem Gillani", "It's embedded in NIM guidance and in NII guidance. There is going to be a NIM cost, there will be an NII cost to do this, but we've incorporated that within the guidance we've already given.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. You may ask your question.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Morning Mike.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Just trying to figure out which trend I should be extrapolating here, if I look at the quarter-over-quarter trend, fourth quarter to first quarter, the efficiency ratio improved from 66% to 65%, you got the mortgage savings, the efficiency improved even while absorbing the seasonal comp increase, you beat consensus, that all looks good.", "If I look at the year-over-year trends, it doesn't look so good and that's where the -- it looks like the efficiency ratio got worse in aggregate, and in wholesale and consumer the comp ratio went higher, revenues to employee went lower. So which trend is more important, the quarterly trend or the year-over-year trend?", "And what gives you confidence that you'll meet your efficiency target of 64% or less this year when it was higher in the first quarter than that? And maybe if you could just give us some detail, how much fixed cost savings do you have left and give us any ballpark, how much you investing for revenue growth? Any other concrete ins and outs would be helpful.", "Aleem Gillani", "Mike, I think that was about seven questions, but let me see if I can take a crack at that. I think you've done well in describing a complex business. We're a good-sized company, it's a complex business in a complex area and trying to extrapolate out of a single quarter or even a single year may not give you a really good indication of where the company is headed if you try and do a straight line extrapolation.", "But maybe you think about it in this context, if you are thinking about the efficiency ratio, where are we headed and how can we get there. Over the last couple of years, as we've said earlier, we've been very focused on expense management.", "Taking $200 million of quarter out of our expense base clearly has been sort of the right thing to do and it has moved us toward this path of improved efficiency overall. From here where we need to get to is perhaps a more balanced approach, and as we think about the remainder of the year and into next year, we'll continue to focus on expense cuts.", "We do have some additional fixed cost that we're looking at now and that I think we'll be able to take out of the system over the course of the next year or two. But that alone isn't going to be enough.", "We are also focused on revenue growth and revenue growth across a wide variety of businesses. We're looking at revenue growth in our consumer and private wealth business and we've got several initiatives there.", "Bill has talked some about the revenue growth that we're expecting in our wholesale business and with the overall improvement in the economy and stabilization in housing prices, perhaps we're going to be able to start to see some more revenue growth from here in the purchase market in mortgage rather than relying as much as we have in the past on the refund market.", "So with all of those things coming into place, we do think that for the rest of this year, we are going to continue to be able to improve our efficiency ratio and keep grinding that down to hit our target for this year.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Yeah Mike, Bill. Maybe the easiest way to say it is this quarter's efficiency ratio was ahead of where we thought we would be internally on our path to 64%, so maybe sort of given all the puts and takes that we know and that we put in into that forecast. We talked a little bit about Wholesale Banking and some of the investments that we're making and some of the revenue per FTE.", "As you well know, we're continuing to invest in that business. We feel good about it. Part of that revenue to FTE, our expansion has to do with some of the expansion we're doing in our national Corporate Banking expansion with offices in Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco.", "And as you know, that takes a while to build up and you've got the investment ahead of that, but similar to what I said about the efficiency ratio, it's also ahead of where we thought we'd be. So we're seeing a good progress there.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Then just one follow-up. I heard during the call saying that some of the improvement is economic dependent, interest rate dependent, macro dependent. So even though you're ahead of where you thought you'd be in Wholesale and the efficiency overall, if the economy or interest rates, the macro environment doesn't pan out as you expect now, do you still think you can get below the 64% ratio?", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Yeah, I think just on the short-term basis on the 64%, I mean we're not projecting massive increase in rates, GDP jumping to 5% or whatever. We're assuming that that's the environment that we're in. That we're in a 2% to 3% GDP.", "We're in a low rate environment and we don't see a material short-term change. Most of those comments I think related to the overall long-term goal of getting to 60%. I think that's where it's a bit more macro dependent, whereas this year is a bit more micro dependent.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. You may ask your question.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Good morning. First question just in response to what we're talking about inefficiency ratio you showed on that page. I don't think the first quarter of '13 was adjusted for the positive accrual you had in incentives last year. You did take out the affordable housing in this quarter of this year, but I don't think the expense that you had a benefit from in last year was adjusted in that lower efficiency ratio?", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, you are 100% correct. You are exactly right, and you see that on the efficiency ratio page, you also see that later when you look at the Wholesale Bank page and the expense base there where that number was adjusted down one-time at the first quarter of '13. You are 100% correct. Thank you.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "So, I think when you adjust that then you would see the efficiency improving year-over-year as well as sequentially?", "Aleem Gillani", "That's the -- just the Bill's comments that when we look at Q1 this year, we feel pretty good, we're I think slightly ahead of our plan for the year and we think we're on a really good trajectory for the remainder of this year to achieve our target.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Other thing Aleem, if you can just take couple of minutes, the swap income reduction is a big issue for everybody kind of thinking into next year. I just thought, if we could compartmentalize that a little bit better, so if you say we're going to lose $67 million going for $102 million down to $35 million, just for mathematic and just kind of thought process, what if you replaced those swaps today. How much of the $67 million could you actually replace at the current rate today, at current market?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Marty, I probably wouldn't want to replace those swaps with other swaps, because the whole plan of swaps is actually designed to make us more asset sensitive in the future, which is exactly where we'd like to be.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Right. I'm not saying you'd want to actually do that. I was just trying to compartmentalize the $67 million into two pieces. One is one that it's really related to you becoming more asset sensitive, well that's a decision that you give out, because you are making that decision.", "And then the second part is, how much more asset sensitive are you becoming, giving up that $67 million or 100 basis points. So we give up this, we are getting this, that's what I'm trying to build that trade off.", "Aleem Gillani", "Okay, right. So, if you think -- let's think about it this way. We ended the quarter with asset sensitivity rate of about 2.3%, so if we get a 100 basis point increase in rates now, 2.3% of sort of $5 billion odd in net interest income per year will get us about $115 million a year back. And then as the swaps roll off, as we become more asset sensitive, then you to think about that in context of every billion dollars that rolls off in the swaps.", "If you go back and look at our K, we've shown you what the roll off schedule looks like for swaps over the next couple of years. Every billion dollars gets us about 0.2% more asset sensitive. So, by the time we get to 2015 and 2016, all things being equal, you could see a path where we are twice as asset sensitive than as we are today.", "Marty - Guggenheim", "So, in that sense, you'd be giving up out $67 million to benefit by, let's say, $120 million, about twice -- almost twice as much?", "Aleem Gillani", "Something like that.", "Marty Mosby - Guggenheim", "Okay. All right. Thanks.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yeah, if we get to 100 basis point parallel increase.", "Ankur Vyas ", "We have time for one more question. Jane?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Morning, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Just on the granularity a little bit here on the expenses. The other expenses were particularly low in the quarter, even adjusting for the low income housing credit adjustment, and also, the processing itself were significantly lower than we had thought. So I just want to see if you can give us an idea of the run rate to expect in those areas.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think we're looking at sort of general an overall run rate across the board. One of the reasons expenses might be down in one area is we've got an increase in another area. So, rather than focusing on the line by line issue, John, if you think about the total number from here on to the rest of the year, I do think that we are in generally the right band for expenses. And I would expect that if we don't get revenue increases, we'd see the overall expense base stay around this level, sort of low 1.3%.", "But as Bill said a few minutes ago, we are looking to get some revenue growth between now and the end of the year. And our challenge and what we are going to be working on doing for the remainder of the year is taking that revenue growth in, but still managing the expense base tightly in order to keep the efficiency ratio still moving downward.", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "And there is just a lot of good efficiency things within that other expense category. And it will fluctuate up and down, but core we are more -- we are doing things more efficiently that show up there.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Okay. So given that and given your comments that you're tracking ahead of your 64% target at this point, no -- is there no decision at this point to potentially lower that target?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think for '14 we have set the target. And -- let's be clear, it's not an easy target. This is we are working hard to get there. We are going to continue to work hard to get there this year, but that's a target for this year. And once we achieve it, we are going to be setting ourselves a higher bar for next year and you already know what our medium term target is, which is substantially more difficult than where we are now.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then lastly just one other thing on the swap income, I know you just gave good color about that you probably wouldn't replace the additional swaps. But any other activities either in the bond book or elsewhere outside of natural asset sensitivity that you could do to offset or to replace that foregone income?", "Bill Rogers, Jr.", "Well, we have been taking actions. In the first quarter we did take some actions in our on balance sheet portfolio, and we also did take some actions actually in the swap book in our off balance sheet portfolio. If you look at the total of those books now we're running at about an overall duration between those books at a little bit over three years.", "And I feel actually feel pretty comfortable with that kind of a number, I wouldn't want to be extending that out much more from here, thinking about where rates are very likely to go over the next couple of years.", "So our overall focus to grow income is going to be less in the on and off balance sheet securities portfolios and it's going to be much more in doing client business and growing both low and fee income with clients.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Ankur Vyas", "All right. Jane, this concludes our call. Thanks to everyone for joining us today.

(NYSE:STI) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 21, 2014  8:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Ankur Vyas - Director of Investor Relations", "Bill Rogers - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Aleem Gillani - Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "Steve Moss - Evercore", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Jason Harbes - Well Fargo", "Operator", "Welcome to the SunTrust Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed within the Investor Relations section of our website, www.suntrust.com.", "With me today, among other members of our Executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, www.suntrust.com.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks, Ankur. So usual, I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for details on the consolidated results. I'll then wrap up my comments by reviewing our performance at the business segment level.", "Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.72 on net income to common on 387 million. Earnings per share were negatively impacted by certain non-core items this quarter, primarily the resolution of the HAMP investigation, which was partially offset by the sale of RidgeWorth, our asset management subsidiary. We'll discuss both of these items in further detail later in the presentation. And where appropriate, we'll discuss our financial results on an adjusted basis to make sure the underlying core story is more clear.", "The net impact of these items was a negative $0.09. And excluding them, earnings per share were $0.81 or net income to common of $436 million. This represented 19% growth in EPS compared to the second quarter of 2013 and was also 11% higher than the previous quarter. Our results this quarter reflected solid performance across a number of key areas, including continued broad-based loan growth, good deposit growth, increased non-interest income and strong asset quality performance.", "Adjusted revenue increased 3% over the prior quarter and was relatively unchanged from prior year. Looking at the component parts, net interest income was relatively flat as the benefit of loan growth was offset by a decline in loan yields. Adjusted non-interest income increased $66 million relative to the prior quarter with solid growth across a number of fee income categories, most notably in investment banking. Compared to the prior year, adjusted non-interest income was relatively unchanged as higher investment banking and retail investment income negated the decline in mortgage related income.", "Adjusted expenses were slightly higher than the first quarter as the seasonal decline in personnel expenses was offset by modest increases in certain cost categories and higher operating losses. Compared to the prior year, adjusted expenses were down 4% due to a decline in cyclical cost and our continued focus on overall disciplined expense management.", "Maybe more importantly, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined 130 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points compared to the prior year. The sequential process reflected the solid revenue momentum we generated this quarter, which is we've said before will become an increasingly important component of achieving our efficiency ratio goals. Our performance this quarter brings our year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 64.2%. And while this keeps us on track to achieve our better than 64% goal for the full year, it certainly does not reduce our focus on executing the revenue and expense initiatives throughout the company.", "Average performing loans increased 2% sequentially, driven by growth in our C&I, commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. In particular, I'm pleased with the breadth of our loan growth as it's across many industry verticals, lines of businesses and geographies. This is the result of our concerted efforts to better diversify our business mix. Average client deposits were also up 2% compared to the prior quarter with a favorable mixed shift towards lower-cost deposits continuing.", "Our credit quality performance continues to be on a positive trend. Non-performing loans declined 3% from the prior quarter and 21% from last year, while the net charge-off ratio remained steady at 35 basis points. We also completed some modest balance sheet management actions this quarter in order to reduce risk, improve the liquidity and increase long-term returns. Aleem will cover the details of these actions later in the presentation. Finally, our capital position remains solid with tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on both the Basil I and Basil III basis.", "Our recap, we achieved core operating momentum across each of our businesses, while maintaining strong fundamentals in the form of our asset quality and capital position. Completing the sale of RidgeWorth and resolving key legacy mortgage matters allows us to more firmly focus our efforts on expanding and deepening our client relationships and improving the profitability of our company.", "I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before we delve into our normal review of operating performance, I'll quickly review the significant items that impacted this quarter's results.", "First, we completed the sale of RidgeWorth, which resulted in a $105 million pre-tax gains, which is modestly higher than the amount we advised when we announced the transaction. Second, we reached a definitive agreement with the government to resolve claims related to SunTrust Mortgage's administration of HAMP, which resulted in a $204 million pre-tax charge. And lastly, we recorded a $25 million net benefit related to the progression of certain previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters.", "Excluding the impact of these three items, which in aggregate were negative $0.09 per share, earnings per share were $0.81, which as Bill said was 19% higher than the prior year and 11% higher than Q1 of this year. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in investment banking income, higher mortgage servicing income given lower refinance activity, and improved asset quality, which benefited both the provision expense and our adjusted cyclical costs. These positive trends more than offset an $81 million decline in mortgage production income.", "The sequential quarter earnings increase was driven by broad-based growth across most non-interest income categories and a decline in the provision expense due to improved asset quality, which more than offset a return to a more normal effective tax rate this quarter.", "We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was generally stable relative to the prior quarter as solid loan growth was balanced by loan yield compression. Net interest margin declined 8 basis points, primarily due to a 7 basis point decline in loan yields. The decline in loan yields was most notable in our C&I book, though we also felt this in our non-guaranteed residential mortgage and indirect auto portfolios. The drivers of our loan yield compression are a mix shift as wholesale banking is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the portfolio and continued competition in our markets and businesses.", "While loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower, this is an isolated view that does not capture non-interest income and deposit revenue. Our focus is on meeting the full suite of our clients' needs and maintaining a disciplined view of entire relationship returns.", "Securities yields declined 10 basis points sequentially due to a combination of lower reinvestment yields and higher premium amortization in the quarter as MBS cash flows increased. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, net interest income was also relatively flat as the aforementioned combination of loan growth and loan yield compression neutralized each other. Net interest margin declined 14 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower loan yields, though modestly offset by lower deposit costs and higher securities yields.", "Looking forward, we would expect full year 2014 net interest margin to decline compared to 2013, albeit at a slightly lower pace than the decline from 2012 to 2013, which was 16 basis points. This is primarily due to continued compression in loan yields and lower commercial loan swap income. You will recall that as our commercial loan swaps mature over the next few years, we become more asset sensitive, which is a conscious design of our balance sheet management strategy over the medium term.", "Moving to Slide 6, adjusted non-interest income increased $66 million from the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth across most fee income categories. Investment banking was the notable driver of growth, up $31 million sequentially, with strong client-driven momentum across most products and businesses. Mortgage production income increased $9 million sequentially or 21% as closed loan production increased 31% and gain on sale margins declined slightly.", "Mortgage servicing income declined $9 million sequentially due to higher decay of the MSR asset, a result of increased prepayment speeds during the quarter. Retail investment services continued its positive trends, resulting from our ongoing focus on meeting more clients' wealth and investment needs. Trust and investment management income declined $14 million sequentially, driven entirely by the loss of RidgeWorth's revenue stream during June. For the five months ended May 31st, RidgeWorth contributed approximately $20 million to SunTrust's pre-tax income.", "Service charges for deposits increased $5 million sequentially, primarily driven by normal seasonal patterns between the first and second quarters. Card fees were also up $6 million or 8% as our clients are increasingly seeing the value proposition of the SunTrust card offering.", "Other non-interest income excluding the sale of RidgeWorth increased $27 million sequentially, primarily driven by a $19 million gain from the sale of government guaranteed mortgage loans, the details of which I will cover on Slide 10. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income was flat, as growth in mortgage servicing, investment banking and retail investment services counteracted the lower mortgage production income.", "Let's now move on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted non-interest expense increased $17 million relative to the prior quarter and declined $49 million relative to the prior year. Personnel expense declined $37 million sequentially, primarily driven by the anticipated seasonal decrease in 401(k) and FICA related costs. This decline was offset by $11 million in higher outside processing and software costs and $5 million in marketing expenses, both of which are typically lower in the first quarter. In addition, other non-interest expense, excluding the $36 million legacy affordable housing impairment in the first quarter, increased $24 million driven by higher legal and consulting fees alongside of certain discrete asset write-downs.", "Lastly, adjusted cyclical costs increased $21 million sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in operating losses, which as we have stated in the past can be variable. Excluding operating losses, we would not expect significant variability in cyclical costs going forward. Compared to the prior year, adjusted non-interest expense declined $49 million, which was primarily driven by lower cyclical costs and our continued focus on expense management, partially offset by higher personnel expenses which is primarily the result of targeted hiring and revenue producing positions.", "As you can see on Slide 8 and as Bill mentioned, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved 63.6% from 64.9% in the prior quarter as the revenue growth we delivered in the quarter was greater than the modest increase in adjusted expenses. This brings our year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 64.2%. We will need to continue to execute on our revenue and expense plans to achieve our less than 64% target for the full year 2014. Our long-term efficiency ratio target continues to be below 60%.", "Turning to credit quality on Slide 9, asset quality metrics remained favorable this quarter, though sequential quarter improvements continued to moderate. Non-performing loans declined 3% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued improvements in the residential loan portfolio. The net charge-off ratio remained at 35 basis points. We sold $149 million of accruing TDRs this quarter that further enhance our asset quality position.", "The financial impact of the TDR sale included $10 million in net charge-offs, a $16 million reduction in the allowance and therefore a $6 million reduction to the lower mass provision. While the TDR sale will not materially change our reported asset quality metrics, it will have a modest positive benefit on certain rating agencies and regulatory calculations. Improvements in asset quality and the TDR sale were the drivers of a $37 million sequential decline in the allowance, a 3 basis point reduction in the allowance ratio and a $29 million decline in the provision for credit losses.", "Going forward, we would expect continued, but modest improvements in non-performing loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. We would also expect net charge-offs in the residential portfolio to drift modestly lower in the near term. However, commercial and consumer net charge-offs are already at or below normal levels and will at some point revert to the mean. Over the near term, we would expect the allowance to remain generally stable as any asset quality improvements may be counterbalanced by loan growth. And as a result, the loan loss provision should roughly approximate net charge-offs. However, as you know, the ultimate level of reserves will be determined based on our rigorous review processes.", "Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10, average performing loans increased $2.3 billion or 2%. Growth was driven by the C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios and partially offset by a slight decline in the residential portfolio. C&I loan growth was broad based and driven by the commercial auto dealer group alongside increases across most CIB industry verticals. CRE loans were up 8% sequentially due to growth in our institutional business, success in our REIT platform and a portfolio acquisition. Consumer loans were also up modestly, given growth in our consumer direct, indirect auto and credit card portfolios.", "Average residential loans declined approximately $600 million, driven by legacy asset run-off and the impact of targeted balance sheet management actions. We sold $325 million of government-guaranteed mortgages this quarter, which resulted in the aforementioned $19 million gain reported in other income. We also sold $149 million of accruing TDRs, which I previously discussed. In addition, we transferred $2.1 billion of government-guaranteed mortgages to loans held for sale in anticipation of selling those loans during the third quarter.", "We currently plan on reinvesting the proceeds of the government-guaranteed mortgage loan sales into high-quality liquid securities that are compliant with the forthcoming LCR requirements. We expect the resulting balance sheet profile to be revenue-neutral and LCR-positive. Pro forma for these actions we expect to be substantially compliant with the proposed LCR rules issued last year.", "Relative to the prior year, average performing loans increased $9.8 billion or 8%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. We continue to do our part to support our clients and to help grow [ph] the income.", "Turning now to deposit performance, average client deposits were up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 3% compared to the second quarter of 2013 as solid growth in low-cost deposits was partially offset by timed deposit run-off, in particular maturities of our higher-cost CDs. This continued favorable shift in deposit mix helped move interest-bearing deposit costs down by 2 basis points and 6 basis points respectively compared to the prior quarter and prior year.", "Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Tier 1 common equity expanded by approximately $300 million as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the estimated Basil III common equity tier 1 ratio stayed stable at 9.7%. Tangible book value per share increased 3% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year due to the growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI.", "During the period, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.20 per our previously approved capital plan. In addition, we repurchased $83 million in common stock, which was modestly lower than originally planned, given guidance the industry received from the Federal Reserve in the second quarter. This guidance limits a bank holding company's ability to make capital distributions to the extent, but its capital issuances including employee share-based compensation are less than the amount indicated in its submitted capital plan.", "Given this new guidance and our forecast for employee-related share-based compensation, our gross four quarter buyback program will be approximately $50 million lower than the $450 million maximum in our original capital plan. The net share dilution impact from this change is immaterial.", "With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover the business segment performance.", "Bill Rogers", "Okay. Thanks, Aleem. The core operating momentum generated in each of our business segments helped drive the overall solid quarter corporate results we've discussed this morning. And our consumer banking and private wealth management business net income was up 7% compared to the prior quarter and prior year. The momentum in this business is improving in both non-interest income and from lending activity.", "I'm pleased with the growth in retail investment income as it's evidence of the partnership between our Premier Banker's branch managers and financial advisors all centered around better serving the savings and investment needs of our branch-based clients. Card fees are also up due to higher purchase volume related to clients' increased utilization of our credit card product. Our focus in these areas is particularly important, given the pressures on more traditional consumer banking related fee income sources.", "Consumer loan production was strong this quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven mainly by growth in our credit card and LightStream businesses. This growth however continues to be muted by run-off in our home equity portfolio. Provision for credit losses declined both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by continued improvement in the asset quality of our home equity portfolio.", "Expenses were up 6% in this segment compared to the prior year, driven primarily by targeted investments in revenue-generation positions, particularly in the wealth and investment side of the business in addition to some smaller discrete charges incurred in the current quarter, all of which are focused on improving the long-term efficiency ratio.", "We continue to make progress in this segment. Our investments in technology and people combined with early efficiency initiatives and continued credit improvement are tracking positively against the impact of low rate environment.", "Now let's take a closer look at our wholesale business. Our wholesale business posted a very strong quarter with net income up 7% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. In particular, we delivered a record performance in investment banking fees, which was the primary driver of the notable non-interest income growth during the quarter. Our performance here is reflective of consistent investments we've made in CIB over the past few years. The recent success can be attributed to expanding product capabilities as M&A and equity related revenues in particular were more accretive to our overall capital markets product performance. We're also doing a better job of serving our corporate and commercial banking clients' capital markets needs, which is evidence of our improving client reach.", "Net interest income increased 6% year-over-year due to good loan growth and deposit growth. The continuing declines in loan yields counterbalanced some of this growth. Wholesale loan growth momentum continued as average loans grew 4% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Loan growth was broad based led by CRE, commercial auto dealer, corporate banking expansion activities and CIB's asset securitization and energy practice groups. Deposit growth was also solid with increases across each line of business.", "Our pipeline has also increased this quarter, which is normally a good predictor of wholesale loan growth prospects that are for the remainder of the year. Competition however remains tough, which may lead to ongoing pricing pressure. Our focus will remain on serving our clients, financing the growth needs, while ensuring we earn an appropriate overall relationship return. We continue to invest in our wholesale business to broaden our client base and better serve their needs. We've opened offices outside our traditional regional markets and are pleased with our progress thus far in our ability to attract talent and business. More broadly, we're optimistic about the growth and profitability outlook of this segment.", "Now moving on to mortgage, as we previously disclosed, we resolved certain key legacy mortgage matters this quarter. First, we announced definitive agreements with the government to resolve FHA related origination matters alongside the national mortgage servicing settlement. Secondly, as discussed earlier, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding our administration of the HAMP modification program. These agreements resulted in significant cost, but settling them was the right course of action for our shareholders, team mates, communities and clients.", "Excluding the impact of legacy mortgage matters this quarter, mortgage banking net income increased 17% sequentially. Getting this business to a level of sustained profitability is an important goal, and this quarter's performance is another step in that direction.", "Taking a closer look at revenue, non-interest income increased sequentially as higher production income and the gain on sale of guaranteed mortgage loans more than offset the decline in servicing income. Total closed loan volume increased 31% sequentially, driven by increased purchase originations associated with the spring and summer selling season. Adjusted expenses were stable sequentially, a solid accomplishment that reflects the continued focus on our cost saving efforts which neutralized the higher cost typically associated with improved production.", "Provision declines continued given the ongoing improvement in the credit quality of the residential mortgage portfolio. The mortgage market continues to improve, albeit at a lower rate than we and the industry had initially expected at the beginning of the year. The market continues to be supportive by good overall affordability, though inventory level's building activity in the amount of first time home buying continued to dampen broader mortgage origination volumes.", "With the resolution of additional legacy mortgage matters this quarter, we can further sharpen our focus on meeting more of our client needs and generating sustained profitability in the mortgage segment.", "So in summary, this quarter's consolidated performance reflected solid momentum across each of our businesses, particularly on the revenue side. Our markets are exhibiting favorable macroeconomic trends and housing continues to improve. Our clients from consumers to small business to corporate feel increasingly positive about their prospects and we continue to invest in our team mates and businesses to ensure we can light the way to their financial wellbeing.", "Ankur, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thanks. Wendy, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question today is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "Just if I can start on the efficiency ratio, as we think about the back half of the year and into 2015, I guess first for the second half, I know you guys were looking at $1.5 billion worth of expenses. While it doesn't sound like you're going to be giving us formal cost targets there, is there any of that in the current run rate and should we expect to see another step-down in costs from that program? And then second, I know you're probably not ready to give us 2015 guidance at this point, but can you just talk about what you think some of the key levers are going to be for you to make efficiency improvement in 2015 just given the $235 million-or-so fall-off from swap income?", "Bill Rogers", "Most importantly, what we're continuing to focus on is our below-64% efficiency ratio for this year. And I think we made some good progress this quarter. As we highlighted, we're going to start reaching inflection points where we want revenue to be a larger component of that efficiency ratio. Achievement in this quarter was while maybe not the inflection point, maybe good evidence of the starting of an inflection point.", "As it relates to the ops costs that we've talked, sort of $1.5 billion that we're underway, I mean we have roughly 100 different specific projects against all of those opportunities. And they're in the type of areas you'd expect ATM, consolidation of how we process, call centers, lending centers, vendor relationships, check image and branches. The list sort of goes on and on as they're set up to up to 100 different things.", "The reason that we've been careful about assigning a number to that I think is probably evidence in this quarter, because we're going to make sure that we continue to also make the investments long term and our ability to achieve the revenue that we need. So I feel good about where we are on the ops cost. How much of that will actually manifest itself in '14 will really be dependent on sort of how we look at our additional investments on the revenue side.", "Aleem Gillani", "So let me come back to the expense point just for a moment. Part of your question was will we see another step-down. And I think the answer to there is generally no. We saw the big step-down already and that was from 2012 to 2013. And you saw what we did then was take a full 13% out of our expense base between sort of '11 and '12 rate now into the '13 and '14 rate. So the big step-down in costs I think has already happened.", "In the near term, as I look at our overall expense base, we're managing it within that sort of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion level quarterly and that of course is revenue dependent. If revenue stays where it is or falls, you'd see that number come off a little. If revenue moves up considerably, you'd see that expense number probably move up to where the top end of that range. And I think you saw a little bit of that this quarter when revenue is this quarter up about $60 million and expense is up about $20 million. So that kind of a ratio, that's a trade we'd take any day to continue to grow our improvement in efficiency and continue to get the efficiency ratio down. As you heard Bill say, that's what we're really focused on, becoming a more effective, more efficient company and a little bit less orientation toward the exact expense number.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "And if I can ask one follow-up, more longer-term, when we think about your asset sensitivity, I know we've spent a lot of time talking about the impact of the swap roll-off over time. However, when I look at Slide 9, you've done a lot to improve the deposit base and you highlighted that in the prepared remarks. And we've heard peers talking about a pretty wide range in terms of potential outflows. So just can you remind us in your plus-3.2%, what you're assuming for both outflows and deposit betas? I think on my math, you were at about a 60% beta last cycle. However, given some of the improvements that you've made in the base, I would expect that to be lower this time. So any color you can provide there would be helpful.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yeah, of course, it's really difficult to say, because it depends very much on exactly how the rate cycle changes, how rates move, whether it's more long rates or more short rates or whether they go in parallel, what the economy looks like at that time. Having said all of that, when we think about it and we think about the last time around and what could happen this time, it seems to me that we're going to see deposit betas mostly for the industry in that sort of 40% to 70%. To your 60% number I think is dead on. But I would also say that given the enormous amount of liquidity there is in the system that deposits rates probably lag somewhat as overall rates go up, that there's probably no need for deposit rates to move up quickly as overall rates move up. And so I think this time could be a little bit different as we think about what betas look like, just because there is so much more liquidity overall in the system this time.", "Bill Rogers", "And, Ryan, I think you're accurate to point out all the change in the construct of our deposit base as well. I mean on deposits now are less than 15% of our total deposit base. So there has been a lot of change. And as you can imagine, deposit betas is a rich discussion that we have maybe daily in the company.", "Operator", "The next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.", "Steve Moss - Evercore", "This is Steve Moss for John. Regarding loan growth here, you guys sounded a bit more optimistic in terms of the overall balance sheet trends. Should we look for a pickup here with regard to loan growth? And then the second part, I did notice that the commercial real estate loan growth did slow. Wondering if you could give some color on those dynamics?", "Bill Rogers", "I mean this was a very good loan growth quarter. We indicated that we're optimistic about pipeline and things that we see. But I want to be careful about sort of taking this quarter and extrapolating it long term, because it was a very, very particularly good quarter. As it relates to CRE, it's going to just be bumpy on the way up. It's up 42% sort of year-over-year. So any one individual quarter, based on something we might do off a smaller base, is going to be a little bumpy. So I still feel very good about CRE. I feel very good about the track we're on, quality of the assets that we're adding and the long-term opportunity. I haven't changed my view on that a bit related to this quarter.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "My first question is just about net interest income. It looks like, Aleem, to your point about the core compression, you're kind of running in place on a core NII basis if I take out the hedge benefit. And noting your slide with the updated data, can you talk us through whether or not it's reasonable to expect core net interest income to grow from here? And with the loan growth, can you see any acceleration in core growth or will the core NIM compression keep you kind of just running flat for now?", "Aleem Gillani", "I think you almost gave up the answer right in your question. Obviously NII is overall very loan growth dependent. As we look at loan growth and as we look at a continued grind downward in NIM, we are expecting and we hope to be able to deliver NII that does continue to grow year-over-year. The full year this year, we're expecting and we hope we will be able to sell more than last year. But as you said in your question, it is loan growth dependent. Our frontline team mates have been able to deliver a very steady nice loan growth to us so far this year. And if we can continue that, we are looking to see NII continue to move up and offset that decline in margins.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Is it fair to say that that's a trend that you could expect next year, because I know it's early to give explicit guidance on next year? But the swap roll-off looking to be about $240 million or so next year, do you think you can also produce NII dollars growth on a reported basis as you get into '15 as well?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, that's what we're going to be working hard to do. Obviously, again very economy dependent. But if the economy does continue to grow the way we expect and we're able to meet more client needs across more of our footprint in all of our segments, then that's what we're going to be targeting.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Just my follow-up on that will just be then on the NIM on the core, you mentioned all-in NIM being down a little bit less than this year. But do you see the core NIM stabilizing any time soon from that loan yield compression or is there just until rates go up a kind of continued drip in the NIM?", "Bill Rogers", "Ken, that's a really good question. I think there is a continued drip in the NIM for now. But if you assume that rates don't fall anymore from where they are today, I do think NIMs will start to stabilize in 2015. They will grind down between now and then. But assuming overall rates don't fall anymore between now and then, I think we will see stabilization next year.", "Aleem Gillani", "We always tend to delink NII and non-interest income, and I think they need to be better linked. I mean you can see the focus that we've had on building out our fee capability, probably CIB and investment banking or the most notable examples of that, but they're linked. So we see good growth in C&I loan growth. It's under a lot of margin pressure. But you can also say we're driving a lot more fee income off that loan base. Our average fee is up about 30% year-over-year. So our effectiveness and sort of moving from that right side to that left side and being more impactful for what we can do for clients, those two things are linked. I think it's important to maybe think about them together.", "Operator", "The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "Your capital is obviously very strong. And when you came through the CCAR, I think your capital was reduced by less than 200 basis points during that process. What's your guys' view on what's a comfortable tier 1 common ratio that you want to get to once we finally get through these CCARs and everybody knows what to expect in a year or two?", "Bill Rogers", "I think over time we're getting more and more clarity on this as the regulatory view and the industry view converges. I'll tell you I don't think we have perfect clarity today, but I'm feeling better about where we are today relative to where we were a couple of years ago. If I think about where I think we'll end up, you've got to start with the regulatory numbers, you have to start with 7. Add on a sort of potential SIFI buffer, whatever you think that will be. And then we'll have our own internal board that buffer on top of that, of course because we never want to go through the SIFI buffer. So you put all those together and it's a number that starts with an 8 and that's a little bit more clarity than I'd say we had a couple of years ago.", "I don't think I can tell you today whether it's a low-8 or a high-8, but I think it starts with an 8. And then it depends on how the stress test change over time. I think we're getting more and more visibility into the CCAR process, the nature of those tests and the effect that those tests are going to have on the industry overall and on us. But having said all that, it's 9-somewhere today. So over the medium term, whatever the medium term is, I would be looking for a stability in the short term and a decline in the medium term toward some number that starts with an 8-somewhere.", "Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets", "You guys mentioned on the call about the margin coming down a bit due to a greater presence of the wholesale portfolio getting larger. What's causing the C&I loans in your average yield table where the yield in the C&I loans was down a fair amount? Is it just competition or what's causing the yield compression in the C&I loan portion of the loan book?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, overall, there're two points that you referenced, Gerard. One is that our overall portfolio mix is changing. You'll recall that going into the financial crisis, we were very much oriented toward residential mortgage, but perhaps overly concentrated in that product line. And over the last several years, we've been working hard to optimize the mix within our balance sheet, become more diversified.", "One of the effects of becoming more diversified and reducing the sort of future risking as in volatility of our earnings is that as wholesale grows as a component of our overall mix, wholesale yields are a little bit lower than retail and consumer yields. But that's one of the things that's bringing margin down a little bit. The other thing is just the sheer amount of competition in the C&I space overall. And as overall margins decline in that space, that's affecting us too.", "One thing you might want to look at that might help you is if you look for example that BBB bond spreads and look at how they've changed over time, you'll see that quarter-over-quarter, BBB bond spreads dropped 18 basis points Q1 to Q2. That's kind of the space in which a lot of regional banks play in when it comes to meeting corporate client needs. So that's one of the things that's affecting us.", "Operator", "The next question is from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "Can I go back and talk about the RPL to TDR sales? You said in the prepared remarks that you sold about $149 million. Did you take a loss on that? I can't find it in the documents. Did you take a loss or a gain on that sale?", "Aleem Gillani", "Maybe here is the way to think about that, Paul. We took a charge of $10 million on that sale. However we already had $16 million in reserves that were specifically identified to that portfolio. So the net effect of everything was actually a $6 million reduction in our provision expense for this quarter.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "You have about close to $2.6 billion of this stuff sitting on your balance sheet still, because right now we're hearing that the pricing for RPLs is very competitive. Is there plans to sell some more of that down?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, we've got a pretty good experience this quarter. The net effect of that sale was $6 million reduction in our provision expense and an improvement in some of our credit agency and regulatory metrics. So pricing is good. We're set well. We've got a good experience. We don't have immediate plans to sell any more right now. But what we learned the last quarter I think was helpful as we think about our overall balance sheet profile as we look into next year.", "Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets", "I know there's different prices for stuff that's been current for 24 months versus current for 12 months and stuff like that. I was just interested in what type of stuff you sold?", "Bill Rogers", "I'm sure Ankur and team would be happy to talk with you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Could you elaborate more on Robinson Humphrey? You said you had record investment banking fees. It looks like the revenues grew twice the pace of the five big banks. Just give some color on maybe the mix. You mentioned equities and mergers if you can mention the net income, ROE. It seems like it's over half of wholesale. So more disclosure would certainly be appreciated. And then lastly, you mentioned your capital ratio should start with an 8, whereas the largest investment banking players have capital ratios that start with at least a 9. So are you looking to maybe price more competitively?", "Aleem Gillani", "The 9 might work well for the large investment banks, sort of the Wall Street banks. That's really not us. We're a main street bank and the business that we do in our corporate investment banking set of businesses is really very much aimed at meeting client needs. So given the size of our business and given how vanilla it is relative to some of the more complex businesses that you might be used to covering, the overall capital ratio for us in the context of mix against the rest of our portfolio, the consumer business, the private wealth business, the mortgage businesswe think makes much more sense for us to be in the 8 level rather than the 9 level.", "Bill Rogers", "And then, Mike, I'll also talk about the fees side of the business. And as you know, this is an area that we've been investing in starting with the acquisition of the institutional business of Robinson Humphrey, but making sort of continued and steady investments in virtually all parts of that business. The bulk of that, let's call it, 60% to 70% would be in the syndication high-yield bond origination, investment-grade bond origination, tax exempt bond origination, so to think about as the traditional debt part of the business and that's just continued to track up sort of consistently every quarter rationalized for every quarter.", "And then what we talk about is just more kick in on the M&A part of the business, more kick in on the equity part of the business. So instead of an eight-cylinder engine hitting on six cylinders hard, all eight cylinders are now starting to pump pretty aggressively. Relative to the others, I mean you sort of think about one of the big differences is think about the trading component. So our trading business is very issuer-driven and it was down about 6%. Others were down obviously multiples of that in the larger course. So that might explain a little bit of the difference.", "And again, ours is just reflective of continued investment, continued slogging it out, adding good talent, high receptivity from our clients. I think they have been very receptive to a middle market investment banking business with capital.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "And I assume this is what you mean when you say grow revenues per every dollar of expense to improve your efficiency ratio. I think I missed your guidance for 2015 or maybe you didn't give it. So 2015 efficiency ratio, it was 63.6% in the second quarter. Where do you think that will be in 2015?", "Aleem Gillani", "Mike, we haven't actually given guidance yet for 2015. We'll do so as we get closer around the end of the year.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Is it safe to assume that it would be below 64% since that's your target for 2014 or will the run-off of swap revenues push that back higher?", "Aleem Gillani", "Mike, we want to get better every year. We intend to become a more efficient company every year with a long-term target of below 60%. So directionally, it's safe to assume it will be down.", "Operator", "Our final question today is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.", "Jason Harbes - Well Fargo", "Actually it's Jason Harbes from Matt's team. So just want to follow-up on loan growth. I mean it looks like your loan growth was best-in-class this quarter, but you sounded a little bit less optimistic looking into the second half. Just kind of wondering is that a function of the transfer of the guaranteed mortgages or are you seeing any signs of softening across any of your markets?", "Bill Rogers", "Let me be clear. I didn't mean to be less optimistic. I just want to be careful about annualizing the quarter too many times. Based on what we see with pipelines, what we see from our clients, utilization rates are being slightly up. Our availability being up as well as growth being up, I don't have the reason to be other than optimistic about where we are from a loan growth standpoint.", "Aleem Gillani", "Jason, I appreciate you pointing out the $2 billion sale. Obviously that will affect our total loans. But as I said earlier, that $2 billion moves into securities and you expect the lower effect on the revenue to be immaterial.", "Jason Harbes - Well Fargo", "I guess my follow-up would be are you seeing any more or greater strength in the Florida market versus some of your other markets, any other noteworthy differences? I think in the past, Bill, you've talked about the Florida market being higher beta and the economy down there does seem to be outperforming. So just curious if you can give us any update there.", "Bill Rogers", "I'd say universally, we feel better about what's going on in the Florida market. Housing is certainly stronger virtually across every market and some markets very, very good. Our commercial activity in Florida is also good. Some of our top performing commercial units are in Florida. Our consumer business, like I've said before, never really had the fall-off, but it continues to be sort of consistent with the rest of the company. All the data we see on Florida and the time I spent there is positive. Tourism industry is sort of going gang busters. Net in migration back in to the state at a pretty high clip. Very good business environment, you've seen some corporate headquarters move to Florida. So I think we're actually seeing the other side of that beta right now.", "Ankur Vyas", "All right. Thanks, everyone. Wendy, this concludes our call. Thanks to everyone for joining the call today.

(NYSE:STI) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2014  9:00 AM ET", "Executives", "", "Ankur Vyas - Director, IR", "Bill Rogers - Chairman & CEO", "Aleem Gillani - CFO", "Analysts", "", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "Operator", "", "Welcome to the SunTrust Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "", "Thanks, Christine. Good morning, and welcome to our third-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during the call. The press release, presentation, and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, investors.suntrust.com.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Rogers", "", "Thanks, Ankur. As usual, I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Aleem for details on the results. So, following Aleem\u2019s comments, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks by reviewing our performance at the business segment level.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06 on net income to common of $563 million. However, as previously disclosed, we recognized $130 million discrete tax benefit, which we returned to shareholders through a one-time share buyback. Excluding this gain, earnings per share were $0.81 on net income to common of $433 million.", "Our adjusted results were in line with the previous quarter and up 23% from last year, reflecting solid loan and deposit growth, further efficiency improvements, and continued strong asset quality performance, all of which helped mitigate the impact of the persistent low rate environment.", "Our adjusted revenue was up 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% from last quarter. The sequential decline was primarily a result of our investment banking business rolling off record results in the second quarter and the loss of some investment management income due to the sale of RidgeWorth.", "Net interest income was generally stable relative to both periods as solid loan growth mitigated spread compression. With regard to non-interest income, as we said before, several of our fee-oriented businesses are subject to some seasonality. With that in mind, I believe our year-to-date fee income performance tells a more accurate story of how we\u2019ve been able to leverage our investment to these businesses to drive more consistent execution and deepen client relationships.", "Our non-interest income, excluding the impact from RidgeWorth and mortgage-related revenues, was up 7% year-to-date with meaningful improvement in investment banking, retail investment services and traditional private wealth. These positive trends combined with higher mortgage service and income helped offset the 60% year-to-date decline in core mortgage production related fees.", "Expenses declined relative to both periods, previous quarter and the prior year, and notably, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 61.9% for the quarter. That brings our year-to-date ratio to 63.5% and keeps us on clear track to deliver on our 2014 sub-64% efficiency ratio commitment.", "Our performance this quarter demonstrates our continued focus on efficiency improvement, and importantly, our steady progress towards our long-term target is evidence of our methodical transformation to a more efficiency conscious culture across the company.", "So, looking at the balance sheet, period-end loan balances increased 2% sequentially led by growth in C&I, traditional CRE, and our consumer direct portfolio. However, average performing loans were flat as a result of the $2 billion guaranteed residential mortgage loan sale this quarter.", "Average client deposits grew 1% relative to last quarter with favorable mix shift continuing. We\u2019ve built positive and broad-based momentum across our lending platforms and are focused on ensuring our deposit growth keeps pace.", "Our credit quality performance continues to be strong, and in the quarter we were able to further improve the overall asset quality of the balance sheet through targeted non-performing asset reductions. As a result, NPLs declined 15% sequentially and net charge-offs ticked up slightly to 39 basis points.", "Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from last quarter with Tier 1 Common estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III basis.", "So with that as a quick overview, I\u2019ll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more detail on the results.", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. We\u2019re glad you are able to join us at our slightly later start time this morning, and we are pleased to be able to accommodate those of you who needed to watch Thursday Night Football last night.", "Earnings per share this quarter were $1.06, and included in that result is a $0.25 benefit that we recognized upon the completion of a tax authority exempt. Excluding the impact of this benefit, adjusted earnings per share were $0.81, which was in line with the previous quarter and 23% higher than the third quarter of last year. ", "The year-over-year increase was driven by 3% adjusted revenue growth as a result of higher mortgage servicing income, a gain on sale of mortgage loans, which I will discuss later, and slightly higher net interest income. A 3% reduction in adjusted expenses also contributed to the year-over-year improvement as we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives and benefited from lower cyclical costs. These positive trends more than offset the $45 million year-over-year decline in trust and investment management income resulting from the sale of RidgeWorth.", "Sequentially, earnings per share were flat as the decline in non-interest income and modestly higher provision expense were offset by a 5% reduction in adjusted expenses. Lastly, adjusted year-to-date earnings are up 19% compared to the previous year. A solid balance sheet and fee income growth, lower expenses, and improved asset quality have more than offset the $205 million reduction in core mortgage production income and 14 basis point net interest margin compression during that same time frame.", "We\u2019ll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on slide 5. Net interest income was generally stable relative to the prior quarter and prior year as loan growth negated loan yield compression. Net interest margin declined 8 basis points sequentially primarily due to a 7 basis point decline in loan yields. The decline in loan yields was most notable in our C&I book though we also felt this to a lesser degree in our commercial real estate and indirect auto portfolios.", "The drivers of our loan yield compression are mix shift as wholesale is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the portfolio, and continued competition in our markets and businesses. While loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower, C&I business often brings with it additional non-interest income and deposit revenue. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients\u2019 needs and maintain a disciplined focus on entire relationship returns.", "Securities yields declined 9 basis points sequentially, primarily due to higher prepayments as MBS cash flows increased into our investment portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was relatively flat as solid 6% earning asset growth neutralized the 16 basis points of margin compression.", "Overall, the net interest margin has declined in 2014 more than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. As commercial loan growth has been stronger than expected and yields continue to compress. Looking forward, we expect fourth quarter net interest margins to decline approximately 3 to 6 basis points from the current level primarily driven by lower commercial loan swap income.", "We have been and will continue to carefully manage our overall balance sheet duration and utilization in light of the continued low interest rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rate.", "Moving on to slide 6, adjusted non-interest income declined $72 million from the prior quarter driven primarily by lower investment banking income and the loss of investment management income from RidgeWorth.", "Investment banking declined due to the strong performance in the prior quarter, seasonally lower client activity this quarter, and transaction timing. Year-to-date investment banking income is up 14% with syndicated finance, M&A, and equity offerings being the primary drivers of growth.", "Trust and investment management income was down $23 million sequentially, however, RidgeWorth represented $31 million of the decline. And our core private wealth business grew $8 million.", "Mortgage production income was down $7 million quarter-over-quarter as gain on sale margins declined slightly. Closed loan production increased 11% while applications declined 4%, reflecting the return to more normal seasonal patterns in the mortgage business.", "Retail investment services and card fees continue to be on a positive track as the result of our ongoing focus on meeting more clients\u2019 needs. In addition, service charges for deposits increased $9 million, partially driven by seasonal trends.", "Other non-interest income, excluding the gain on sale of RidgeWorth, declined $13 million as a $41 million gain related to the $2 billion sale of government guaranteed mortgages was negated by a $49 million impairment of a leasing portfolio due to market-driven declines in residual values of certain assets.", "Lastly, we incurred $9 million of net securities losses in the quarter due to a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio.", "Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income increased $40 million driven by higher mortgage servicing income.", "Finally, to echo Bill\u2019s previous comment, year-to-date non-interest income, ex RidgeWorth and mortgage-related revenues, was up 7% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we are creating in our CIB business, as well as retail investment services, core private wealth, and credit card.", "Moving on to expenses, adjusted non-interest expense declined $71 million or 5% relative to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $33 million sequentially, driven by the sale of RidgeWorth, a reduction in FTEs and lower benefits costs. In addition, other non-interest expense declined by $36 million, in part due to severance and other costs in the prior quarter.", "Adjusted cyclical costs declined $13 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by lower operating losses, which, as you know, can be highly variable. Going forward, we do not anticipate cyclical costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base with the exception of occasional volatility in operating losses.", "Compared to the prior year, adjusted non-interest expense was down $44 million or 3%, driven by lower cyclical costs and broad-based reductions across most expense categories as a result of ongoing efficiency initiatives. These reductions were partially offset by higher personnel expenses due primarily to an incentive accrual reduction booked in the third quarter of last year.", "As you can see on slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.9% from 63.6% in the prior quarter as the $71 million decline in adjusted expenses offset the sequential revenue decline. This brings our year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 63.5%, a full 150 basis points lower than the same period last year despite an approximately $200 million decline in core mortgage production income.", "We are on track to meet our commitment to an efficiency ratio of better than 64% for the full-year 2014, and we continue to make progress toward our long-term target of sub-60%.", "Turning to asset quality on slide 9, our credit quality performance has been strong and we took proactive steps to make even further improvements in the third quarter. Non-performing loans declined 15% sequentially and 27% year-over-year, driven primarily by targeted reductions in the residential loan portfolio. We took a small additional charge-off and moved $53 million of non-performing mortgage loans to held-for-sale status in anticipation of a sale in the fourth quarter.", "Despite the substantial 15% reduction in the non-performing loan portfolio, the net charge-off ratio increased only modestly to 39 basis points, reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio. The improvements in asset quality led to a $35 million decline in the allowance and 6 basis point reduction in the allowance ratio while the provision expense increased $20 million sequentially given the modest increase in net charge-offs.", "Over the near term, we expect further though moderating declines in non-performing loans primarily driven by the residential portfolio. We also expect our loan loss provision expense to be fairly stable over the next few quarters, in line with our results for the past five quarters as continued strong asset quality may offset positive loan growth. However, as you all are well aware, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by future economic conditions and our rigorous quarterly review processing.", "Turning to balance sheet trends on slide 10, period-end loan growth was up 2% sequentially. We view the period-end comparison as a more accurate picture of our core loan growth in the quarter as it removes the impact of the $2 billion loan transferred to held-for-sale last quarter. Growth was driven by the C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, and was partially offset by a slight decline in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios.", "C&I loan growth was broad based and driven by not-for-profit and government clients alongside increases across almost all CIB industry verticals. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in our institutional business, success in our REIT platform and a small portfolio acquisition.", "Consumer loans were also up nicely given growth in our consumer direct, indirect and credit card portfolios. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and believe that it\u2019s consistent with our multi-year effort to optimize the balance sheet and add diversification by growing high-quality commercial and consumer loans.", "During the quarter, we completed the $2 billion government guaranteed residential mortgage loan sale and recorded a corresponding $41 million pre-tax gain. The proceeds of the sale were reinvested into level-one high-quality liquid securities to help us meet the liquidity coverage ratio requirements. As of September 30, our liquidity coverage ratio already surpasses the January 1, 2016 90% requirement. Therefore, we expect any further actions we take regarding the LCR will not be material to our earnings or balance sheet profile.", "On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8.3 billion or 7% driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. This performance is reflective of our execution of certain growth initiatives alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets.", "Turning now to deposit performance, average client deposits were up approximately $2 billion or 1% compared to the prior quarter and 4% compared to the prior year as good growth and low cost deposits was partially offset by time deposit run-off. This continued favorable shift in the deposit mix helped reduce interest-bearing deposit costs by 2 and 6 basis points compared to the prior quarter and prior year, respectively.", "Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $250 million as a result of growth in retained earnings while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remained stable at 9.7%. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 11% compared to the prior year due to growth in retained earnings.", "During the quarter, we purchased $215 million in common stock, which includes the $130 million one-time buyback we completed upon receiving a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. In addition, we anticipate repurchasing approximately $230 million of stock over the next two quarters.", "Lastly, I\u2019d like to highlight the credit rating upgrade we received from Standard & Poor\u2019s this week, which acknowledged the actions we have taken as an organization to substantially improve our asset quality position, increase our capital ratios, and enhance our profitability profile over the last several years.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.", "Bill Rogers", "", "Okay. Thanks, Aleem. On a segment basis, we continue to make progress, balancing expense discipline with the opportunities to continue to invest for future growth. So go to slide 13, in our consumer and private wealth segment this quarter, we saw solid returns on our recent investments and continued to show good revenue momentum both in our wealth management and lending-related businesses.", "Looking at the numbers, net income grew 17% sequentially, but was down 5% year-over-year as a result of higher provision and expenses. The combination of moderating asset quality improvement and incremental balance sheet growth drove the higher provision, and higher expense base reflected increased hiring related to revenue-generating positions in addition to elevated environmental operating losses.", "Relative to both periods, continued revenue momentum was a key driver of our performance as revenues were up 3% sequentially and year-over-year. The growth was balanced between net interest income and fee income, the latter of which saw positive trends in trust and investment management, retail investment services and deposit fees.", "Consumer loan production was up 23% year-over-year led by continued momentum in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect auto portfolios which more than offset the run-off in home equity and guaranteed student loans.", "Our success in consumer direct and credit card in particular demonstrates our focus on driving growth in higher risk-adjusted return businesses. The growth in the consumer direct portfolio has been driven by distinct lending platforms we have developed that are efficient, high-end customer satisfaction and a good credit quality with average FICO scores north of 750.", "Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially reflecting our enhanced focus on meeting more of our clients\u2019 deposit needs. We expect more recent investments in technology such as the digital banking platform and SummitView, our well-received financial planning and account aggregation tools to further improve our deposit gathering capabilities.", "The big picture, we continue to focus on investing in digital, improving our deposit momentum and driving revenue growth opportunities to help offset headwinds associated with the prolonged low rate environment. Expense discipline, however, is also a key contributor to achieving our strategic objectives in this segment and we continue to balance cost reduction opportunities with prudent investments for further growth.", "Our wholesale segment continues to be a key growth engine for the company and although there are a few puts and takes to the numbers this quarter, the core trends remained strong. Looking at the numbers on an adjusted basis, net income was up 5% sequentially and 23% year-over-year driven by continued revenue momentum and strong asset quality.", "Adjusted revenue declined slightly from last quarter but grew 5% relative to the prior year. Net interest income was up relative to both periods driven by loan and deposit growth but this was partially offset by decline in loan yields. Non-interest income, particularly investment banking and trading income, accounted for the sequential decline as this business is subject to quarterly fluctuations based on transaction timings and market conditions.", "On a year-to-date basis, investment banking income was up 14% and trading income was up 12%, reflecting the investments we\u2019ve made in talent and capabilities and our increasing market share. Average loan balances grew 4% from the prior quarter led by broad-based growth throughout wholesale\u2019s client segments, most notably, as Aleem noted, the energy practice group, not-for-profit and government group, and CRE.", "In addition, we benefited from solid growth in our asset securitization and asset-based lending products and our national corporate banking expansion continue to gain traction. Loan yields remain under pressure, constraining our margin in this segment. However, as we\u2019ve said before, we take a holistic view of our client relationships with deposit and fee generation also playing a role in our risk-adjusted returns. And in that light, year-to-date deposits are up 10% and capital market related fee income is up 13%.", "Across the platform, our markets remain competitive but our wholesale value proposition continues to be well received by clients. Where we choose to compete, we continue to win share. Lower loan yields will continue to be a challenge, and we\u2019re working hard to mitigate that impact by being more disciplined about utilization of the balance sheet in addition to continuing to expand our fee income and deposit opportunities, particularly with our commercial clients. So, looking forward, our investment banking backlog and lending pipelines are healthy and we remain bullish on the overall growth and profitability outlook for this segment.", "Our mortgage segment continued to show steady progress quarter-to-quarter. This was the third consecutive quarter of core profitability for this segment with adjusted net income of $18 million, which was down sequentially due to lower production revenue and a gain-on-sale of loans in the prior quarter, along with higher charge-offs associated with the aforementioned targeted reductions in our NPL portfolio. A key driver of our improved profitability in this business has been strong expense discipline evidenced by an 11% sequential and a 34% year-over-year reduction in our core cost base. ", "The revenue environment here remains challenging with industry origination volumes 15% lower than what, I think, we all expected at the beginning of the year and roughly 50% lower than the 10-year average prior to 2014. While the market is supported by good overall affordability, lower inventory levels, building activity and the amount of first-time home-buying continue to dampen total origination volumes. So for our part, we continue to invest and performing mortgage servicing as we both have the capability and capacity to grow this business.", "In the quarter, we added approximately $4 billion to our servicing portfolio through a combination of outright purchases and agency loan production. Looking forward, we expect to settle and transfer approximately $10 billion of additional servicing over the coming couple of quarters.", "In addition, I want to highlight our progress on the efficiency side as the mortgage segment has been a large hurdle in achieving our overall corporate efficiency goals. In the quarter, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved further to just over 70%, which is in stark contrast to previous years where the business was running well north of a 100%. Our steady progress reflects our strategy of carefully managing our expense base, improving our risk profile, particularly until the origination activity begins to normalize. ", "So before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to give a brief mention of our announcement last month regarding the naming of the new ballpark for the Atlanta Braves, which is set to open in 2017. This is part of a mixed use year-round facility that will feature office, residential and retail development and it\u2019s a unique opportunity to improve our brand recognition both regionally and nationally.", "So to summarize the quarter, our performance demonstrated solid momentum across each of our businesses with a mix of revenue momentum in certain areas combined with good expense discipline in others, the net of which was further improvement in our overall efficiency.", "The economies in our markets continue to track positively and we\u2019re committed to investing in our teammates and businesses such that we\u2019re delivering on our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients, our communities, and our shareholders.", "So with that said, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur, for Q&A.", "Ankur Vyas", "", "Great. Christine, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I\u2019d like to ask all the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may ask your question.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "Aleem, I just wonder if you could -- you guys had a great expense result this quarter, certainly helped by RidgeWorth. You had been talking about a 1.3, 1.4 type range. Certainly this number puts you below it from here. And Bill, I heard your point about getting below the 64% for the year, but just relative to that really good expense print and then expectations going forward, are we in a new range or was this an anomaly?", "Bill Rogers", "", "I think it\u2019s a little bit of both, Ken. This is a little bit of an anomaly which sort of demonstrates how we\u2019re working hard to make sure that we really improve the overall efficiency ratio of the company. If you think about quarters where we\u2019ve had revenue growth, you\u2019ve seen some expense growth. In the quarter now where you saw some revenue decline, you saw an expense decline. Now, it won\u2019t always track that way. We can\u2019t guarantee a 100% correlation, but in general, we\u2019re really trying to pull the levers we think are appropriate to match the opportunities that we see in our markets.", "Having said that, I do think that the 1.3 to 1.4 range that I had referenced in the past, I could probably tighten that up a little bit, I\u2019d probably start thinking about that next year as perhaps in the 1.3 to 1.35 range, bring that top-end down a little as the expense efforts that we\u2019ve been working on over the last several years are actually paying off.", "Ken Usdin - Jefferies", "", "Okay, and my follow-up just then, so in the third quarter itself, the seasonal declines off of investment banking, what points would you make that were kind of better than normal I guess would be the question?", "Bill Rogers", "", "If you are talking about investment banking, I would think about the third quarter as being sort of typically a lighter quarter in investment banking anyway, and we did see some transactions move timing from third quarter to fourth quarter. As we think about investment banking now looking at the fourth quarter, we\u2019re feeling pretty good.", "Our pipeline right now was looking pretty strong. I\u2019m not really sure what any actions would result as a result of this week\u2019s market actions, but coming into this week, I think we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how the fourth quarter is going to look for that business.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "", "Just on the topic of loan growth, yours remains pretty good versus peers and I guess I'm looking at the year-over-year and thinking about ex some of the sales you had running maybe around 8%. Some of your peers have talked about pulling back a bit just as pricing has compressed and some areas like leverage lending may not be as appealing as it was before. So just your thoughts on the competitive landscape and do you think you can continue to outgrow the overall industry going forward?", "Bill Rogers", "", "Matt, we\u2019ve seen good opportunities which I think are reflective of a number of things. One is various investments that we\u2019ve made in our business and the capacity that we\u2019ve built ranging from industry verticals to national corporate expansion to CRE. Our markets, regional markets, I think, are performing better. So I think that\u2019s somewhat reflective also of what\u2019s happening.", "We\u2019ve got capacity in areas like CRE where we started from a much smaller base, so we\u2019ve got capacity to grow in that business. I would say similarly to what others have said, as you know, we\u2019re going to be cautious and smart and where we see deals that don\u2019t make sense, we\u2019re certainly backing away from. ", "But we\u2019ve also built a lot of fee-generating capabilities such that on a deal-by-deal basis, we may be able to rate rock a little bit better because we\u2019ve got an ability to put more fees over that opportunity and as you continue to see our improving return, we\u2019re going to want to keep a high focus on that.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay. And then just separately, as we think about the net interest margin beyond the fourth quarter, there were some disclosures in the appendix on the swap income being higher than what you had disclosed I think last quarter. Of course, loan spreads I think are directionally still coming in and rates are an unknown. Just any thoughts on where the NIM might bottom as we look out beyond 4Q?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Yes, Matt. If I think about what 2015 might look like, and given what we\u2019ve seen in the markets so far, it\u2019s a little early to say for all of \u201915, but as a general range, if I think about where 2015 might go on NIM, I\u2019d be thinking about it perhaps full-year NIM on the order of 290 plus or minus with some risks and opportunities on either side of that depending on commercial loan spread compression, how the interest rate environment does overall, what the Fed decides to do, and of course what we do in terms of swaps and I\u2019ll remind you on swaps, all these are are turning floating rate loans into fixed-rate loans. So that\u2019s all they do, and we generate new floating rate loans every quarter.", "So, in the context of the overall macroeconomic environment as we\u2019re thinking about our balance sheet duration, if we have certain duration targets, we\u2019ll be needing to put some swaps on every quarter just to match the new floating rate loans that are coming on.", "So, you\u2019ve seen us take actions in the past several quarters on that book. I wouldn\u2019t really think about that book as being a thing by itself, NII by itself. It really - the swap activities that we have are just in order to use derivative products to manage our overall interest rate risk profile and the duration of our balance sheet and the actions that we\u2019ve taken have helped to grow NII and as long as we continue to get loan growth, we\u2019ll continue to be doing more of that.", "Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank", "", "And the 290 thought for the full year on average, would that include any impact from higher short-term interest rates?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Actually, our forecast right now, Matt, is that we won\u2019t get a short-term rate increase in 2015. We\u2019ve been thinking that for a little while with our anticipated first rate rise coming in early \u201916 and we continue to have that view.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "", "Just as a follow-up to that question, can you maybe run us through the changes that you made to the swap portfolio, how does it change the maturity profile, what does it do to the rate sensitivity and how far does the duration extend beyond 2015?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Yes, Ryan, the new swaps that we\u2019ve put on in the quarter again were done essentially to match what we\u2019re seeing in our commercial loan book and we added a few billion dollars of sort of three and four year swaps. It doesn\u2019t really change the duration profile of the swap book much.", "If you think about our overall swap book, we had a duration there in that three to four year range anyway. So it doesn\u2019t change the profile there, and it had the effect of adding sort of $10 million to $12 million or so per quarter in net interest income starting in 2015, starting in Q1 2015.", "Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs", "", "Got it. And then maybe for Bill, when I think about the progress that you guys have made on the efficiency ratio, so you're below 62% for this quarter. You've added some swaps to reduce some of the NII headwind that you have as you move into next year. So I guess you guys have obviously committed to having continued improvement, but I'm just trying to think about the magnitude. I know there are some puts and takes on a quarterly basis, but can we think about this as a good starting point for 2015 or is there too much seasonality in the business that we should think about more as a year-over-year change?", "Bill Rogers", "", "I think there is too much seasonality to sort of pick one quarter a high or low and say that\u2019s the starting point for future. We\u2019re averaging 63.5% for the year. I\u2019m confident and barring anything crazy and [indiscernible] got you rethinking about anything crazy, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be under 64% for the year, and we\u2019ll, as the end of the year progresses and we start to think about next year, we\u2019ll give more guidance as to the efficiency ratio for 2015 but suffice it to say it will be below 64%. So we\u2019re going to continue to trend down, that\u2019s the commitment we\u2019ve made.", "The speed at which we commit to trend down will be dependent upon a lot of things, not the least of which is interest rate environment and our expectations of an interest rate increase on the short-term side, but the net is we\u2019re going to continue to, on average, trend down.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "Hey, I just wanted to dig in a little bit into the expansion that you've been announcing and executing on recently in the commercial space, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, et cetera. Get a sense as to, A, how you are finding it. I know it's small dollars, but just wanted to get a sense of that, what else is on the docket to expand and how those expansions have been doing relative to plan in terms of revenue growth, et cetera?", "Bill Rogers", "", "I think you accurately pointed sort of small now, but relative to plan we\u2019re tracking ahead of where we were relative to plan. A couple of banks I\u2019ve been really pleased with the quality of the talent that we\u2019ve been able to attract for those offices. So it\u2019s a good confirmation that people like our platform, they like what we\u2019re doing and they want to be a part of it. So that is probably maybe exceeded my expectations and they were really high to start with.", "In terms of the business that we\u2019re attracting, similarly I think we\u2019ve been real pleased with the quality of what we\u2019re putting on. As you said, it will sort of start slower, it will tend to be -- start a little more asset side and then fee income will follow so that will be a sequence, that will be pretty natural in that progress. But everything we\u2019re seeing to-date, I feel good about and we\u2019re tracking ahead of where we thought we were internally both from a talent side, asset growth side, and most importantly, returns side.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "And how are you getting into the new clients? I mean obviously assets first. So maybe you could speak to the pricing versus structure type of debate that's out there.", "Bill Rogers", "", "I think we\u2019re leading with advice, so we\u2019re leading with advice and knowledge, and we\u2019re not leading with pricing and structure. Price and structure is somewhat market dependent, but we\u2019re leading with advice, and so the way we\u2019re getting into clients and attracting new situations is bring in the knowledge base that we\u2019ve developed from our industry verticals, the product capacity that we\u2019ve developed on our platform and adding an additional bank to situations. We\u2019re not always starting on the left side. You\u2019re going to start on the right side and work your way to the left. But it\u2019s really leading with advice and skill versus price and structure.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "Can I just ask one bigger picture follow-up, is energy -- energy industry has been an important driver of CapEx spend in the U.S. obviously and in some of the institutions, loan growth in C&I and/or sometimes in CRE, but I just wanted to get a sense with oil now priced where it is, do you see any potential pullback in that and if so, if there are other industries that you see an opportunity for expansion of things like CapEx?", "Bill Rogers", "", "I mean that\u2019s clearly one that we\u2019re watching. The good news is that energy has been a good part of our growth but it\u2019s not sort of the only part of our growth. This quarter actually was quite good on the energy side, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019re going to watch and be careful about and the pundits are sort of all over the place on how much additional capital will be there, but our portfolio is good so I feel positive about that where we are. Might it have slower growth in the next several quarters relative to last few quarters possibly, but that\u2019s not sort of the only driver for us.", "And the fee income side, I view this as potential. I mean anytime you have little volatility, I think if you are on the advice business, you\u2019ve got more opportunities on the fee side.", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Betsy, I think there is a little geopolitical aspect to this also as center of energy production in the world moves from the Middle East into the U.S., we\u2019re poised well to be able to take advantage of that and we continue to have optimism about the energy sector overall.", "Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay, no, that's helpful. Just interesting, as the breakeven points come down, just wondering if you're seeing any pullback near term on reinvestment, but it sounds like at this stage not. So I appreciate the color.", "Bill Rogers", "", "I think it\u2019s too early to tell right now.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. You may ask your question.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "", "I want to see if you could give us more color on the other expense line in the third quarter, just how we should think about that. It pulled back pretty materially here and I know you had cited some discretionary items that drove that. So, I wanted to get an idea about could that balance or could that line item spring back next quarter just given the volatility of the items involved? Thanks.", "Aleem Gillani", "", "John, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d use the word spring back, but I do think that we had a couple of items in Q2 that make the Q3 number look like it\u2019s dropped off. We did have a couple of discretionary items that showed up in Q2.", "Having said that, I would expect, as I think about next year, assuming revenue stays above where it is that we would see expenses in that sort of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion range. If revenue falls, we\u2019ll be pulling on expense levers to maintain efficiency, and if revenue goes up, then you might us - we might see expenses moving up towards the top end of that range, but as sort of a rough guidance for a range, I would think $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion looks right now for me to be a fair number for quarterly expenses next year.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "", "Okay, all right. And then on that point, can you just give us a little bit of detail on the expected impact to your pension expense for 2015 if rates remain where they are currently?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Our pension expense is actually right now negative because we\u2019re running a fully-funded pension plan. So we happen to be in relatively good shape relative to, I think, the industry and Corporate America overall. I would expect, if yields drop, that you might see that the benefit we get from the plan come off a little and remember that our plan overall was frozen. So, given the frozen plan we\u2019re running, we\u2019re a little bit less sensitive to rates overall than perhaps others you would see.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "", "Okay, all right. And then one last very quick one. I wanted to see if you can give us the amount of loans currently tied up in the MetLife JV that you initiated last year and what are the current yields in that portfolio?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "The total amount of loans that we\u2019ve got is in the sort of $600 million to $700 million range, and I don\u2019t have a yield number off the top of my head, but I would think about that whole structure as being not just yield driven, but also giving us the opportunity to talk with those clients, provide them expertise and start to incorporate those clients into our overall capital markets activities and help them in other parts of their requirements besides just providing funding.", "Bill Rogers", "", "I think just to talk about that as a percent of our portfolio, it\u2019s a small percent of portfolio. This was an important relationship to add diversity both geographic and product to our portfolio. These are very, very high quality, lower ROA absolutely than the balance of our portfolio, but the balance of our portfolio combined with this is tracking to be accretive to our ROA objectives.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. You may ask your question.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "", "So thanks for the color on sort of the tough mortgage revenue environment. However, a few of your peers have started to talk about just in the few days a pickup in refi applications and I was wondering if you could help us get a sense on what the upside to price could be to your production income if rates do stay this low through the end of the year?", "Bill Rogers", "", "Yes, Erika, one robin doesn\u2019t make a spring category. The last two days have been really good. Our locked volume and app volume was up 80% in two days, so very significant. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to continue. I think we\u2019ll have to sort of see things settle out a little bit, but I think you are accurate in pointing out that the risk is to the upside and how significant that upside will be.", "I\u2019m not ready to quantify at this point. So we\u2019ve got a couple of weeks under our belt and we are starting to see some normal activity, but certainly the early couple of days were really positive reads in the way that you\u2019d expect. Will this be refinanced boomlet? I don\u2019t know. Certainly a lot more conversation, we\u2019ll look at our portfolio, we\u2019ll determine how much marketing we want to do and how much spreads you have between what\u2019s in the portfolio and where current rates are, and I think we\u2019ve got good math and good diagnostics around that and we\u2019ll figure it out. But I think the risk is to the upside, but I\u2019m not sort of ready to commit to what that is yet till we get into a little bit more.", "Erika Najarian - Bank of America", "", "And my second question is just a quick follow-up. On slide 19, thank you for providing us the swap schedule. I just wanted to ask a couple of things. One is that I assume that also includes the swaps that were recently put on in terms of your quarterly average four count for 2015 and as we think about how that tracks on a quarterly basis, is it $50 million each quarter or is there sort of more significant drop-offs that we should consider as we think about the quarterly earnings trajectory for next year?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Erika, that number does include all of our actions through the end of the quarter, through the end of the third quarter, and $50 million as a quarterly average is sort of roughly stable. So not exactly, you\u2019ve got a few million swing here between one quarter and the next, but $50 million on average is a good and rough stable number for now.", "Again, I would remind you we\u2019ve taken actions every quarter. If you go back and look at this slide for the last several quarters, you see that number going up consistently quarter after quarter.

You may ask your question.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "", "Hi, going back to efficiency, how much does the run-off of the swap portfolio hurt the efficiency ratio next year? And what I'm trying to get to is, if you take your $1.3 billion, $1.35 billion quarterly expense guidance off of this quarter's revenues of $2 billion, 1.3 billion times divided by 2 billion is a 64% efficiency ratio implied and if you take the higher end of your guidance, 1.35 billion, that's a 66% efficiency ratio based solely on this quarter's revenue. So that guidance implies 64% to 66% based on the quarter, but you said it should be lower than 64% next year. I just want to make sure I understand how you're thinking about this. And one other follow-up, you were at 62% this quarter and you're saying you'll be below 64% next year. So I just don't want to get too excited about the linked-quarter efficiency improvement if your guidance is for it to back up a little bit.", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Thank you, Mike. I appreciate you not getting too excited about one quarter. One quarter really isn\u2019t - any one quarter no matter whether it\u2019s good or bad, really isn\u2019t telling about sort of overall trends. However, you\u2019ll recall at the start of this year in January when we gave guidance on efficiency ratio for this year and we said it would be below 64%, there was a little skepticism out there that we\u2019d be able to achieve that.", "We\u2019ve worked hard. We\u2019ve done what we can on revenues. We\u2019ve done what we can with clients. We\u2019ve done what we can with expenses in order to achieve the number we committed to for this year and right now we think we\u2019re on track to achieve the below-64% for this year. As we get to next year, we\u2019ll set guidance for next year and our trend has been and our objective has been to continue to improve.", "So, as we develop, what we think, a good forecast is for next year, we\u2019ll give you guidance in January as to what we think the efficiency ratio target for us ought to be next year, what we ought to be held accountable to and we\u2019ll try to make that a more efficient target than we have this year and I would look for us to try to continue to improve this over time.", "Mike Mayo - CLSA", "", "We look forward to the fourth-quarter guidance.

The last question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. You may ask your question.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "", "Thank you. Let's go back to that $200 million earnings hit from the swaps as you have already kind of given into the fact that you're adding some swaps here recently with growth. But as you've pushed your horizon for the rise in interest rates and the Fed funds rate not until 2016 and as we've seen in the long end of the curve, it's flattening, so we don't really feel like even when rates go up, you are going to see the long end go up too much. So re-rolling the swaps doesn't seem like a lot of risk if we're talking about such a benign interest rate rise over the next couple of years. So I know when you first talked about rolling them off, you thought rates were going up in \u201815. So is your attitude towards doing those things changing at this point?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d say Marty that our attitude overall is changing. Our ALCO meets regularly and sets for the company what we think are prudent interest rate risk targets and an overall duration for the balance sheet, and within that we try to manage our rate risk within the guidelines set by ALCO to maximize both current income as well as market value of equity of the whole company. So we are looking at this regularly, we are looking at it monthly.", "We\u2019re taking advantage of either big changes in client behavior or changes in market behavior wherever we can and I think you\u2019ve seen us over time demonstrate a little bit of an aptitude toward being able to do this well and as we continue to see opportunities and as our client business continues to grow, we\u2019ll be taking advantage of both of those to manage our rate risk in total, one component of which is this book.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "", "Just one follow-up to that. How much in short-term rate rise do you need in your sense to breakeven to letting the swaps roll off? So is it 50 basis points, 100 basis points, 200 basis points? How much do you need to refill that hole?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "Our overall asset sensitivity, as a company, is 3.9%. So, if we get 100 basis point parallel shift in rates, you\u2019d see our net interest income climb by approximately 4% and that\u2019s going to be about the kind of number that you see as a headwind for us next year.", "Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks", "", "Got you. So the 100 basis points is what you're looking for to make up for what you're losing here?", "Aleem Gillani", "", "At this time.", "Ankur Vyas", "", "All right. Thank you everyone. This concludes our call. Thanks for joining us today, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations department.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thank you, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to SunTrust fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the Company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, investors.suntrust.com.", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "William H. Rogers", "Thanks, Ankur. I'll begin this morning with a high level overview of the quarter, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Aleem to discuss the results in more detail. Following Aleem\u2019s comments, I'll review our performance at the segment level and wrap up with my perspectives on 2014 as a whole.", "Throughout the year we made significant progress on several fronts, continue to expense discipline and further improvement in credit quality, help to offset the impact of the sustained low rate environment on revenues and translated into core earnings growth and lower adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. Our performance in the fourth quarter continued that momentum.", "Reported earnings per share for the quarter were $0.72 on net income of common of $378 million. This quarter\u2019s results included a $145 million legal provision to both resolve and reserve for legacy mortgage matters. We remain focused on resolving these matters in a prudent fashion and this quarter\u2019s accrual was another step in the right direction. Excluding the legal provision adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 up 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year.", "Total revenue was up modestly relative to the prior quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat as it has been in prior quarters with solid loan and deposit growth offset by continued margin compression. Non-interest income was up 2% sequentially driven primarily by higher mortgage related income and good performance in investment banking. Adjusted expenses were generally stable to the prior quarter, however down a full 7% compared to the prior year driven by continued expense reduction efforts, lower cyclical cost and the sale of RidgeWorth.", "Importantly for the full year we reduced our expense base from 2013 as adjusted expenses were down nearly $200 million or 4% year-over-year. Accordingly we met our efficiency ratio goal with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63% for the year well below the target we set at the beginning of the year. Given our out performance in 2014 and the real revenue headwinds we faced in 2015 further progress in the short-term becomes much more challenging. However, we are committed to delivering further efficiency improvement this year albeit modest to stay on track to achieve our primary long-term goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio.", "Moving to the balance sheet average performing loans were up 2% on a sequential basis and 6% year-over-year with continued momentum in C&I, commercial real estate and consumer. Deposit growth improved this quarter up 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the prior year. A portion of this growth is seasonal and temporary in nature, but our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum driven by better execution and enhanced capabilities.", "Our credit quality continue to improve with NPLs down 17% and net charge-offs declining 11 basis points compared to the third quarter both reaching new multi-year lows, while improving economic conditions have played a role in our strong asset quality performance this is also was the result of significant actions we\u2019ve taken over the past several years to both de-risk and diversify our balance sheet and improve the quality of our production. Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on our Basel III basis.", "So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the financials.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. Before I begin my review of this quarter, I\u2019ll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain non-core items the details of which are included in the appendix of our earnings presentations and release. These items can skew both quarterly and annual comparisons and therefore I will primarily focus on adjusted results to make the core trends more clear.", "Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.72 including a $145 million legal provision related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters which reflects increase legal reserves and the final settlement of a specific matter. This legal accrual was recorded as we made further progress on certain matters in the fourth quarter accordingly based on what we know today we would expect our reasonably possible legal losses in excess of reserves to decline by a roughly similar amount.", "Excluding the impact of this provision adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 which were 9% higher than the prior quarter and 14% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher non-interest income, a lower provision for credit losses and a slightly lower effective tax rate. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year earnings growth was driven by a 7% reduction in adjusted expenses, higher mortgage-related revenue and a lower provision expense which together more than offset the loss of income from RidgeWorth.", "For the full year adjusted earnings per share increased 18% compared to 2013 as solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses and improved asset quality more than offset a reduction in mortgage production income and a 17 basis point decline in the net interest margin.", "Let\u2019s review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was stable relative to the prior quarter as solid loan growth offset the effective margin compression. Net interest margin declined 7 basis points due to the decline in commercial loan swap income and lower securities yields which resulted from higher premium amortization as MBS cash flows increased.", "Core C&I loan yields excluding swap income were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. However, we expect further compression in this asset class given the competitive landscape and low interest rate environment. As we have said before loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower however, the C&I business often brings with it additional non-interest income and deposit revenue opportunities. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients\u2019 needs and therefore maintain a disciplined focus on overall returns.", "On a year-over-year basis net interest income was also stable as 8% average earning asset growth offset the 24 basis points of margin compression. Looking at the full year net interest margin declined more than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year as wholesale banking loan growth was stronger than expected and yields continued to compress. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly in 2014 with ten-year rates declining 80 to 90 basis points from already low levels.", "Looking forward, we expect first quarter net interest margin to decline approximately seven to nine basis points from the current level driven primarily by lower commercial loan swap income. In addition, all things being equal, net interest income will decline by approximately $50 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, given lower commercial loan swap income and too fewer days coming up.", "We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment. While also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates.", "Moving on to slide six, adjusted non-interest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher investment banking and mortgage related income. Investment banking income increased $21 million due to higher syndicated finance and M&A revenues. Mortgage production income increased $16 million on improved gain on sale margins and high refinance activity both as a result of lower rates in the quarter.", "Mortgage servicing income increased $8 million sequentially as a result of a larger servicing portfolio and higher seasonal payment activity in the fourth quarter. Trust and investment management income was down $9 million compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by certain seasonal and nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. In addition, service charges for deposits declined $7 million, again largely driven by seasonal trends.", "Lastly, we incurred $5 million of net securities losses in the quarter resulting from a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income decreased $15 million due to the loss of RidgeWorth fee income, partially offset by an increase in mortgage related revenue. Finally, full year non-interest income excluding this gain on sale of RidgeWorth and its associated revenues was up 4% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we\u2019re creating in our CIB business, as well as retail investment services, private wealth and credit card.", "Moving to Slide 7, adjusted non-interest expense which excludes the impact of the legal provision was stable to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $60 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2014, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Outside processing and software costs increased $22 million due to higher utilization of third party services in addition to normal quarterly variability.", "Other non-interest expense increased $26 million due primarily the higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter. Adjusted cyclical costs were stable to the prior quarter and down $32 million relative to the prior year. Going forward we do not anticipate these costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base, with the exception of occasional variability in operating losses.", "Compared to the fourth quarter of last year adjusted non-interest expense was down 7%, driven by a combination of our efficiency efforts lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. For the full year adjusted expenses were down 4% compared to 2013 and a full 14% compared to 2011. As we look to the first quarter we currently anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical increase in 401(k) and 5(k) expenses and also will return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefits costs.", "Bigger picture on an annual basis we do not expect core expenses to decline from the 2014 level given our revenue goals. However our main focus is on the efficiency ratio and thus we will calibrate our expense base against the revenue environment.", "As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.4% from 61.9% in the prior quarter, as we delivered both modest revenue growth and a slight decline in adjusted expenses. Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 63%. 230 basis points lower than 2013 despite the significant headwinds from lower mortgage volumes and declining net interest margin. In 2015 our goal is to slightly improve upon last years 63% adjusted tangible efficiency ratio.", "As Bill noted earlier progress in 2015 will be significantly more difficult than 2014 for a few reasons. First we\u2019re excepting commercial loan swap income to decline by $185 million, which represents a 150 basis point headwind to our efficiency ratio. Second as discussed on the previous slide our core expenses have declined significantly over the past few years and we do not anticipate further declines. And lastly, having achieved a better than projected result in 2014 we are now starting from a lower base than previously expected.", "Irrespective of the short-term trajectory, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60% and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders.", "Turning to credit quality on Slide 9, our asset quality performance continues to be strong, nonperforming loans declined another 17% sequentially. In small part due to a transfer of $38 million of nonperforming loans to help our sales status, but largely due to outflows that continue to exceed inflows. This significant reduction in the nonperforming loan portfolio was achieved in conjunction with the net charge-off ratio declining 11 basis points reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio along side modestly higher recoveries in the fourth quarter.", "Our allowance for credit losses declined to $20 million sequentially that the continued improvement in the overall asset quality more than offset a reserve build in the wholesale banking segment to address uncertainty in the energy sector. While our energy and utilities clients are important to our overall CIB business they represent only 3.5% of our loan portfolio with 70% of the book in the utilities and power, midstream and downstream sectors, which are not as meaningfully impacted the commodity price volatility.", "Total provision expense decreased $19 million sequentially due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by the lower reserve release. Over the near-term we expect further the moderating declines in nonperforming loans primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are unlikely to sustain themselves that these levels over the long-term that we are not expecting a significant increase in 2015 relative to 2014.", "We also expect our loan loss provision expense in 2015 to be fairly stable to 2014. However, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determine by our rigorous quarterly review processes which are informed by trends in our loan portfolio combined with a view on future economic conditions.", "Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10, average performing loan growth was up 2% sequentially driven by continued momentum in our C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, partially offset by continued declines in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. C&I loan growth was broad based and driven by both our corporate and commercial banking clients. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in both our institutional and regional businesses. Consumer loans were also higher due to growth in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect portfolios. During the quarter we sold $800 million of loans and transferred another $1.1 billion of loans to help our sales status.", "The net gain or loss on the sales and transfers was immaterial. Collectively these transactions were part of our strategy to optimize our balance sheet and improve returns and going forward we will continue to opportunistically evaluate loan sales to further this strategy.", "On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8 billion or 6% driven by broad based growth across most portfolios. End-of-period loans increased to the lower rate of $5.6 billion or 4% compared to the prior year as we conducted approximately $4 billion of loan sales in the second half of 2014. Our solid loan production performance reflects our execution of targeted growth incentives alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets.", "Turning to deposit performance, average client deposits were up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year driven by improved and broad based growth across all of our lines of business. While a portion of this growth is seasonal and will decline in the first quarter, the majority of the growth is core and reflects both investments we have made in client-facing platforms such as SummitView and our treasury and payment solutions offering and our overall increased focus on meeting more of our clients deposits needs. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 4 basis points compared to the prior year.", "Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remain relatively stable at 9.7% due to balance sheet growth. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year due primarily the growth in retained earnings.", "During the quarter we issued $500 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock as part of a longer term process to optimize the mix between common and non-common Tier-1 capital. We also repurchased $110 million of common stock. The cumulative actions we\u2019ve taken to improve our risk and earnings profile combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels should help us to further increase capital returns to shareholders. We submitted our 2015 capital plan earlier this month and we\u2019ll have more to report on this matter in March. Lastly, as of year-end our liquidity coverage ratio continues to exceed the January 1, 2016 90% requirement.", "With that I\u2019ll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.", "William H. Rogers", "Great, thanks Aleem. And I\u2019ll draw your attention to Slide 13. In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management we continue to make progress on our core growth initiative while holding a lot on expenses. Looking at the numbers, net income declined 5% sequentially, but was up 13% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven primarily by higher provision expense, due to some moderating asset quality improvement.", "Total revenue was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but was up 3% year-over-year. Net interest income increased relative to both prior periods driven by continued growth in loans and deposits. Non-interest income was down sequentially due to seasonally higher income and certain nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. Year-over-year, non-interest income was up 3%, driven by growth in Wealth Management related income and card fees.", "Average loans were up half a percentage point on a sequential basis with double digit growth and consumer direct partially offset by continued run-off in the home equity portfolio and certain loan sales during the quarter. Average deposits grew 3% sequentially reflecting our increased focus on meeting more of clients deposit needs particular in our affluent, high-net worth businesses.", "Turning to the full year results, net income was up 7% driven by higher revenue and lower provision, partially offset by higher expenses. Total revenue increased 2% driven primarily by 6% growth in Wealth Management related fees which reflects our increased investment in people, tools, technology to better meet our client needs. These investments were the primary drivers of growth and expenses year-over-year.", "The full year results in this business demonstrate good execution of the core strategic initiatives we\u2019ve outlined in the past. Improving Wealth Management related income, enhancing the growth and returns of our consumer lending portfolio and making critical investments in talent and technology. Heading in 2015, we want to continue our core revenue momentum. However, expense discipline will also remain important as we continue to balance cost reduction opportunities with selective investments for growth.", "Turning to Slide 14, in our wholesale business, wholesale banking remains a key growth engine for the company and we continue that momentum in the business for the fourth quarter. While net income declined due to an increased provision expense, revenue increase compared to the prior quarter and prior year. Net interest income was up 5% sequentially and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth.", "Adjusted non-interest income declined 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year due to lower trading income and structured finance related fees. These trends were partially offset by higher investment banking revenue and particularly good performance given the market volatility in the fourth quarter.", "Average loan balances were up 5% when compared to the prior quarter with growth across the entire platform, we\u2019d growth in almost all of our CIB verticals in addition to the momentum and core commercial real estate, national corporate banking and our specialty commercial groups in particular auto dealer and not-for-profit and government.", "Loan yields remained under pressure constraining our margin however as we\u2019ve said before our risk adjusted return hurdles incorporate the entire client relationship which also includes deposits and fee income generation. For the full year client deposits increased 10% and capital markets related fees were up 9%.", "Looking in our full year results adjusted net income increased 10% driven by solid revenue growth and lower provision, fees were up modestly as lower trading and leasing income combined with the exit of a legacy affordable housing partnership were more than offset by 13% growth and investment banking income. Our full year investment banking performance reflects broad-based growth with record, our new record results across debt and equity capital markets and M&A.", "The success of our platform reflects our continued investment and talent to both expand and diversify our capabilities. This year we have been able to leverage our one team approach to better deliver our capital markets capability to not only our larger corporate client base, but also our core commercial banking and commercial real estate clients and that\u2019s a value proposition that\u2019s increasingly well received. Looking forward our pipelines remain healthy and I am confident that the wholesale organization has the momentum to drive further growth in 2015.", "Shifting to mortgage adjusted net income in the mortgage segment increased $38 million on a sequential basis driven by growth and fee income and lower provision. In particular production related income was up $16 million due to higher volume and gain on sale margins as a result of lower interest rates. Servicing related income was up $9 million due to the recent servicing acquisitions and a seasonal increase in payments. Adjusted expenses were up 12% sequentially due in part to the increased plan activity of the quarter.", "For the full year mortgage delivered core profitability driven by 35% reduction in core expenses. Revenue declined modestly as growth and net interest income was more than offset by decline in fee income. Core mortgage production income declined 47% year-over-year however mortgage servicing income more than doubled driven mainly by lower prepayments in the servicing portfolio in 2014. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined from triple digits in 2013 to 74% in 2014.", "Over the past year our core mortgage business demonstrated significant improvement, this progress was driven by a lot of heavy lifting to normalize our cost base and improve our risk profile. Most of that is now complete and optimistic will be able to more firmly focus on the core strategies in place to meet more client needs, drive higher revenue and deliver incremental efficiency improvement.", "Now before we begin the Q&A part of the call, I would like to take a moment to highlight our accomplishments during the year. So coming into 2014 we faced several meaningful revenue headwinds namely the end of the mortgage refi boom and the ongoing impact of prolong low rate environment on net interest margin. However, we remained focus on the commitments we made our stakeholders and we delivered on those goals.", "For our clients we increased investments in people and enhance capabilities to better anticipate and serve their needs. For our teammates we invested more in training and opportunities to improve their own financial well being. For our local communities we continue to support economic growth through purposeful investments, active partnerships and volunteer commitments.", "Our 2014 United Way campaign was the most successful in the company\u2019s history with teammates donating nearly $6.5 million and for our shareholders we delivered strong efficiency performance and a significant improvement in asset quality the result of which was 18% earnings growth and a 10 basis point improvement in ROI. In addition we more than doubled our capital return. Separately we were able to resolve several outstanding legacy mortgage matters and this quarters legal provision expenses in another important step in that process.", "And then finally for all the teammates on this call, I would like to thank them for what they have done and continue to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients and our communities, and in our ongoing drive for delivering improved performance for our shareholders.", "So teammates thank you. And Ankur let me turn that back over to you.", "Ankur Vyas", "Okay, thanks Bill. Brad, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Good morning.", "William H. Rogers", "Good morning, Matt.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi, Matt.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "I was wondering if you could elaborate on the strategy of trying to optimize the balance sheet by some of the loans that you are selling or moving to held-for-sale or just the kind of approach you are taking in terms of the criteria to evaluate the loans.", "Aleem Gillani", "Certainly, Matt. I guess the first criteria is whether these are single service clients or they\u2019re sort of multi-product clients and to the extent that they are single service clients that makes these loans more eligible for loans that we might be willing to sell. The second criteria is financial, we are looking at the overall return on that relationship and on that transaction and for lower ROA loans those are the ones that we would tend to look at first.", "So in the context of our overall strategy which is the optimizing the entire balance sheet, looking at the risk profile of those loans and our balance sheet, think of this as sort of a continuation of the approach we\u2019ve actually taken over the last couple of years that continue to grow in terms of meeting all of our clients needs and also improve the financial performance and returns of the company.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "And then I guess segueing into just net interest income overall you gave pretty explicit guidance for 1Q, but as we think about all the moving pieces including some potential loan sales and obviously lower rates here, how would you think about the trajectory off of the 1Q level for the rest of 2015?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, for net interest income overall as I think about the year, I think we are going to be treading water around that $1.2 billion type number, we continue to add terrific new business, we continue to grow the balance sheet with both new loans and getting deeper with our current clients, but the rate environment just continues to grind down and offset all of the benefits. So I think for a while we are just going to be treading water around that $1.2 billion level.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "I mean just last follow-up, you talked about plans to grow revenue in your prepared comments, so obviously if net interest income is relatively flat, you are counting on fees, which categories or businesses do you think will be the key drivers?", "William H. Rogers", "Yes, Matt, the good news is we\u2019ve been making investments, so this is not sort of starting from sort of a flat surface and the places where we\u2019ve been making investments and we're seeing the results, and I\u2019ll name them sort of not necessarily in order but sort of go around the horn, what you have obviously seen continued progress in the investment banking part of our business and we\u2019ve added more capability there but we\u2019ve also expanded that reach within our company, so we\u2019ve seen now much more expanded fee generating capability out of our commercial business and out of our commercial real estate business the investments we\u2019ve made in corporate banking sort of around the country, you are starting to now see some of the fee generation that comes from that.", "So there are lots of momentum builders in that business. Everything on the private wealth side has continued to have momentum, we\u2019re up about 6% there, we\u2019ve continued to invest in people, we\u2019ve continued to invest in technology, we're sort of net in hiring mode in that business, but we\u2019ve also done things like put premier bankers in our branches and they are going to really help, we\u2019ve given them a lot more data and a lot more analytics and they are really going to help us mine what we have as an already sort of bias to the affluent in our retail system and we're going to mine that better.", "And then mortgage, so and it\u2019s great to mention mortgage on the positive side, we're going to see some movement there, we\u2019ve already seen here the first couple of days some refi activity, I would love to extrapolate the next two days across the rest of the year, I\u2019m not sure we can do that but we're starting to see some activity not only in the refinance side, but just sort of the core basic business in our retail markets as our markets improve. So there are a number of things, I mean those are sort of just three, but there are a number of things that we're investing in and credit card would be another on the smaller side in terms of fee generation.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Ryan M. Nash", "Hey, good morning guys.", "William H. Rogers", "Good morning Ryan.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning Ryan.", "Ryan M. Nash", "Aleem, I just wanted to make sure I got the message correct on expenses; I think this is now the second straight quarter. We did see expenses come below the 1.3 level; I think you averaged around 1.3 for the year. Given the fact that I know there are some seasonal elements to it, does the 1.3 to 1.35 level still hold and the reason I ask, it sounds like the revenue environment is marginally more challenging at this point in time, so I just want to get a sense of where you would expect expenses to fall out for the full year?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, Ryan I do think that full year expenses as I look at them today are going to be in that sort of $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion range for the year. But clearly as you point out, if they are revenue dependent and the revenue environment could move us out of that range either higher or lower and obviously as we look at overall expenses we\u2019re focused very much on the efficiency ratio. So as we think about what the revenue environment will be and how we adjust expenses against that revenue environment if you start off with a core expectation between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. And then think about we will adjust, we will calibrate that as revenues go up or down. Thinking about Q1 in this context, Q1 probably is up towards the top end of the quarterly range as a result of the normal seasonal effects.", "Ryan M. Nash", "Got, it. And then just putting all the guidance together do you still expect to grow earnings in 2015 from the 3.24 level?", "Aleem Gillani", "We are going to be targeting continued improvement at the Company. So whether that is efficiency ratio, whether that\u2019s earnings, whether that\u2019s returns we want to continue to make this company better over time.", "Ryan M. Nash", "Got it. I figure I had to take a shot. And I guess lastly Bill you talked about 3.5% energy exposure, but can you just give us a sense of energy exposure for the overall bank both from a lending perspective and from a fee income perspective. How is what we\u2019ve seen happen to energy prices impacting capital markets? And then from a consumer perspective are you starting to see the benefits of lower gas prices showing up in both consumer spending and willingness to borrow?", "William H. Rogers", "Yes, sure I\u2019ll try to hit all of those. I think Aleem, outlined the portfolio, it\u2019s about 3.5% of the portfolio and about 70% of that portfolio is really not significantly related to falling oil prices, think about 50% of portfolio is utility. So that sort of suffered a large part as midstream, that\u2019s just the transporting of oil from one place to another, that is not as impacted by prices as a much lower exposure and the E&P side and the oil field services side.", "From a capital markets perspective and really also loan growth perspective, I mean energy has been an important part of what we do, we don\u2019t want to under mine that, but it\u2019s been sort of less than 10% of our loan growth. And the fee part of the business has been pretty consistent over the last several years. So this is not something that\u2019s been disproportionately part of the fee income business.", "Did some of the fee business in the fourth quarter that was energy related not happen yes, that would be accurate and high yield markets sort of tightened up will some of that happen this year maybe. I think actually we\u2019re pretty well positioned, you remember we made a small acquisition of a company called Lantana which is in the advice business and while I think once sort of things level add a little bit probably sort to the later part of this year I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of activity actually in the energy side as people sort of reset and think about their structure.", "As it relates to the consumer side I mean I think you sort of hit it accurately I mean relative to given the fact that we\u2019re not in a lot of the geographic markets that are going to be impacted more by a fall in oil prices well our consumers will see sort of that increase in tax refund equivalent of fall in oil prices. Have we seen it yet, I mean it might be too early I mean I\u2019ve looked closely at spending numbers and a credit card numbers and those kinds of things while they\u2019re marginally up its might be a little bit early to sort of see the total impact of that, but I have to believe that over the course of the year we\u2019ll see the most positive side for us arching much more towards the consumer side than the risk on the energy side.", "William H. Rogers", "Ryan, I\u2019d also point out that the vast majority of our corporate and commercial clients are in our footprint and they\u2019re going to also benefit from the drop in energy prices. So we\u2019ve got this clear differentiation between energy and consumer, but even within the corporate and commercial base our overall client base ought to do better with lower energy prices.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "Good morning.", "William H. Rogers", "Good morning, John.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari", "On the expense side on the comp expense sorry if you\u2019ve already commented on it, but just want to get a little more color on the decline in the comp expense the drivers of it and how sustainable that decline is, is it all related to the efforts you\u2019ve been doing on the headcount side and the efficiencies and should we borrowing any typical seasonality, should we use this as a new base?", "Aleem Gillani", "Now let John, it\u2019s a little bit above, it\u2019s a little bit of we continue to get more efficient, but in addition we also had a reversal of some incentive accruals and actually for the year our medical costs came in lower than we were expecting our experience on that side ended that being a little bit better. So some of the benefit in the fourth quarter was a result of those and as I said earlier if I think about total comp expense I would increase that in Q1 about a $100 million relative to Q4 some of that for normal FICA/401K seasonality and some of that just because we\u2019re starting from the lower number in the fourth quarter.", "John Pancari", "Okay, thank you. Sorry, I have to repeat that. And then on the commercial loan growth in the quarter just want to get some additional detail behind the drivers of the growth and then also your expectation around the C&I portfolio growth in coming quarters?", "William H. Rogers", "The good news John that\u2019s really, really broad based I mean we really saw - if you look at sort of the total year virtually every vertical that we\u2019re involved in on the C&I space group, so some in obviously different paces, but it reflects the diversity of our business mix, the investments that we\u2019ve made, it was fairly universal, it wasn\u2019t sort of in anyone particular place. We did see a little uptick in utilization, I don\u2019t want to sort of overplay that because quarter-to-quarter it can go up and down, but this quarter was up and up little more than we have seen in previous quarters. I think on balance that\u2019s a good thing, hopefully that reflects sort of more of that investment capital type of horn, but it was very broad based.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mike Mayo of CLSA. Your line is open.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi, can you talk more about the efficiency if you striped out the known headwinds with the swaps, how much would you expect the core efficiency ratio to improve in 2015 and if we had to identify three of the reasons for the [indiscernible] efficiency what are you most focused on?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Mike, I think we\u2019re most focused on growing fee income and meeting more of our clients needs across everyone of our segments as well as connecting clients better across our businesses. So I think we have got, as Bill pointed out earlier, lots of opportunity in that space to continue to do better and the growth in that space along with a no lessening in our expense discipline I think will allow us to continue to improve our efficiency ratio in 2015 relative to where we ended up in 2014.", "William H. Rogers", "Yes, I think it\u2019s - I don\u2019t want anyone to think we are hedging it all on our commitment to our expense discipline, that commitment is in place, we\u2019ve created a lot of really positive momentum it continues. What we are balancing is the investment opportunity, so as we continue to achieve efficiency and expense saves, I want to make sure that we're also investing for the future and that\u2019s a delicate balance of walking and as Aleem mentioned, we\u2019ll calibrate. So we\u2019ll calibrate what's happening on the revenue side to the expense side that always does have work quarter-for-quarter and we're committed to continue to improve on the efficiency ratio.", "Aleem Gillani", "Mike, I don\u2019t want to make light of how hard this is going to be, this is really hard in 2014 we had $200 million of revenue headwinds, we fought our way through that and got better. In 2015 we're going to have another $200 million of revenue headwinds. So after doing it once, it gets harder to do it again, but we understand the task in front of us and we're going to be working hard to achieve it.", "Mike Mayo", "I mean the reason I asked the question, again I mean your efficiency ratio was 61.9 in the third quarter, 61.4 in the fourth quarter and your guidance which certainly is appreciated is for under 63%. So you are kind of already there. So on a headline basis it might be tough for us to figure out some of the ins and outs or can you break it out or?", "William H. Rogers", "Well I think that\u2019s an easy math.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, you have always have a seasonal impact.", "William H. Rogers", "Yes.", "Aleem Gillani", "Clearly what happens from the - just on the FICA and reset loan, I mean you have a significant reset in the first quarter, so there always is some seasonal impact and of course we're catching us at the best part of that seasonal impact.", "William H. Rogers", "Yes and don\u2019t forget the revenue headwind that starts now that starts in 2015 relative to the 2014 on the swaps. So we loved being able to deliver numbers that were 61 Mike, but we're starting 2015 in the tougher place.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Hi thanks good morning.", "William H. Rogers", "Good morning Ken.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Aleem, I was wondering this quarter you didn\u2019t make many adjustments to that swap income portfolio ladder and just given where rates have gone and it changes - the macro view of when this head might move, how inclined are you to continue to continue to add to swaps in the future on top of what you have had done in the past.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, I think we continue to look at that very actively Ken through our ALCO process as you know we're continuing to do new loans, or continue to grow the business and those come on, the majority of those loans come on floating, so deciding whether to fix them or not is sort of part of overall balance sheet strategy and we did do a little bit in the fourth quarter, nothing overly substantial on that side, but we\u2019ll continue to manage the overall balance sheet duration and continue to be opportunistic to the extent that we can.", "And if there are large moves one way or the other we\u2019ll consider that in our overall balance sheet strategy. In the fourth quarter we had some small action, in addition you saw the securities loss that was basically moving Level 2 HQLA into Level 1 to make sure that we continue to stay compliant under the LCR. So there are few of these sorts of minor little actions going on back and forth, but as we go through 2015 if there are opportunities that makes sense from a risk versus return trade off we\u2019ll continue to take those.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Okay, got it and a follow-up on the curve, just can you give us a flush out of context of where and how that the low ten-year affects your portfolio or not relative to peers in terms of if we stay here and the lower than expected or hope for ten-year, what parts of the portfolio should we be mindful off?", "William H. Rogers", "Yes. Well I don\u2019t know how it would affect us relative to peer, but when you look at us specifically the ten-year rate affects us in a couple of ways. Number one, it affects us in terms of mortgage rates and mortgages that we put in our portfolio. Typically we\u2019re putting $200 million to $250 million a month of jumbo mortgages within our portfolio and those are split, some fixed, some floating or some fixed, some aren\u2019t and the other place of the ten-year rate affects us is in the investment portfolio and as the rate drops that mortgage-backed securities we have in our investment portfolio tend to prepay a little bit faster and we reinvest that cash at slightly lower rates.", "So with a dramatic drop in rates such as we\u2019ve seen, we would get probably a little bit more public awareness, a little bit more publicity and some of that will happen a little bit faster. The offset to that from a NIM and net interest income perspective of course is increased refis and increased fee income in the mortgage business that I\u2019m hope will act to completely offset the drop in net interest income from lower rates.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.", "John E. McDonald", "Hi, good morning guys. I was wondering about just on the credit outlook Aleem, I think you said you kind of expect to maybe bounce around the charge-off level you are at now, is that maybe 30 basis points kind of in that ballpark, is that what you are thinking about?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think for full year 2014 John; we ended up around 34 basis points, 35 basis points.", "John E. McDonald", "Okay.", "Aleem Gillani", "And we\u2019re expecting a substantial move from that. Remember our through the cycle expectation for charge-offs is 40 to 70, obviously we\u2019re at a very strong point in the cycle. We\u2019ve been below the bottom end of our range and our current expectation is that we\u2019ll stay around that kind of a number in 2015.", "John E. McDonald", "Okay, and I think you said the same thing for the actual provision dollars as well?", "Aleem Gillani", "That\u2019s exactly right. As we look at it today, with what we know today we would expect provision in 2015 to be right around where it was at 2014 obviously that change is quarter-to-quarter, as we review our portfolio and economic conditions, but as we look at it today I\u2019d expect it to be right around the same kind of level.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Terry McEvoy", "Hi, thanks good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Terry McEvoy", "In the past you\u2019ve talked about a CRE heat map of the country could you just maybe discuss areas of strength in the fourth quarter in where you see the best growth opportunities in 2015?", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure. When we think about sort of CRE if I would think about the portfolio maybe almost in some kind of sequence office, multifamily, warehouse, industrial and retail probably in that order sort of as a global basis. Office for us primarily concentrated top markets and top spaces, so it\u2019s more about credit enhancement and positive part. And in large markets it has tended to perform well and be part of the growth.", "On the multifamily side it\u2019s a little spottier and fairness I mean there is some markets that we do a lot of work with some markets where the absorption balance is just right. Globally it\u2019s still okay, but their pockets were, we\u2019ve gone from green to yellow in our map. And we are probably pulling back in a couple of places in multifamily.", "Warehouse and industrial is sort of just of waiting, I mean I think that\u2019s coming back more slowly and we see selective pockets for us part of what\u2019s happening with the east coast ports opportunities, we are starting to see that kind of investments, so you see some of the challenges with the west coast ports, you see the investments that have been made on the east coast. So there has been a lot of development and discussion and dialogue and I think we\u2019re really well positioned long-term there. Retail is just - this would be a long time before it comes back, I mean I think that\u2019s in a slower place that\u2019s not where we have our primary emphasis.", "Terry McEvoy", "And then just as a follow-up, the increase in the provision within wholesale banking in the prepared remarks you talked about taking a look at the energy portfolio, could you just maybe expand specifically on what you did in terms of a stress testing and the analysis around the potential risk there that contributed to that small uptick.", "William H. Rogers", "Yes, Terry, we actually looked at our energy exposure from a bottoms up perspective, we\u2019ve been going through the names, obviously this started in about mid December or so as the market move started to steepen. We looked at our largest energy exposures, accessed each one from a bottoms up perspective that process is on going and we also looked at our overall exposure from a qualitative perspective and decided that while it didn\u2019t look like quantitatively we needed to make an adjustment, it would be prudent and appropriate for us to do so. So the increase in provision is in that context, we haven\u2019t seen any stress amongst any of our clients in that portfolio so far, it\u2019s still early, but we haven\u2019t seen any yet, but we\u2019re just trying to do the prudent thing and get ahead of what looks to be like a big move globally.", "Aleem Gillani", "Brad, we have time for one more question I believe.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. Our last question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Matthew Burnell", "Good morning gentlemen, just a couple of questions on mortgage. I noticed that production in the quarter was up about 20% year-over-year, I guess I\u2019m just curious if you could give us a little more color on your outlook for that business particularly in the wake of what have been some far more attractive mortgage rates throughout most of your footprint over the last few weeks and any guesses as to how long that may last?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, sequentially we\u2019re up about 4% from third and the fourth quarter was - refi was about 40% to 50%, so it really wasn\u2019t sort of the big refi part yet that\u2019s fairly consistent with where we were, so we had seen sort of some core parts of our business. Now that been said, applications are completely different, applications are 60%, 70% plus kind of refi, the first couple of weeks in January. Particularly last few days have actually been quite good and so we are seeing the potential there.", "What I really like is where it\u2019s coming from, so as you know, we invested in our consumer direct business, so to think more online our core retail business. So it\u2019s coming from our markets, we\u2019re keeping our correspondent business sort of at about 50%, so where it was at the fourth quarter and so where it is now. So it\u2019s coming in our higher margin areas and we're able to balance that.", "I want to be careful about over projecting, you can get excited about a couple of weeks and you can extrapolate numbers and get some big numbers as a result of that but I feel good about where its coming from, I feel good about how we're positioned to take advantage of it and the last few days have been very good, people have responded. As you would imagine the denominator let's say for total refinance is smaller, I mean just as you continue to go through a declining rate cycle that happens, but those that are eligible seem to be active.", "William H. Rogers", "Then Matt, I would add to that as you know we're a very good efficient and effective servicer and we\u2019ve been adding to our servicing portfolio over the course of the year, if you look at sort of end of 2013 to end of 2014, we\u2019ve added about $9 billion to our servicing portfolio and that\u2019s generating a nice increase in servicing income for us as we take advantage of our competitive advantage.", "Aleem Gillani", "And it is a good discussion too related to the efficiency ratio, so for example if this heats up a little more than we think. It could be slightly dilutive to our efficiency ratio and accretive to our earnings and we\u2019ll make that trade right now. So that\u2019s a good trade for us to make.", "Matthew Burnell", "Just staying on the theme of fee revenues, just curious as to your outlook in the first quarter and if you have visibility a little further than that that would be helpful for the capital markets business. That obviously was quite a good performer. This quarter has been pretty good in the second half of 2014. Just curious given all the vitality in the markets right now what your outlook might be for the first quarter or first half in investment banking capital markets?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, since you stretched it to the first half that will make it a little easier, because there is some volatility and certain markets are more active than others and clients are coming back and so reevaluating where they stand and what they want to do, but based on our pipeline they look great, our pipeline sort of continue that same momentum that we\u2019ve had in the past. I just think by quarter-by-quarter its going to look potentially a little bit different, but based upon the investments we\u2019ve made which I talked about earlier the pipeline the diversity of our mix and some parts that are actually starting small that have a much larger opportunity to growth, I don\u2019t have any reason to be anything less than optimistic. I think we're going to continue on the same phase, it\u2019s just going to be tricky quarter-by-quarter.", "Ankur Vyas", "Brad, this concludes our call.

After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "Good morning, and welcome to our SunTrust first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation, and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.", "With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our Web site.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then turn it over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks by reviewing our performance at the business segment level, and then of course we will take some Q&A.", "Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.78 on net income to common of $411 million. That was up 7% per share relative to a year ago. Overall this quarter results were solid with good performance in certain areas including continued expense discipline, higher mortgage and capital markets related income, strong credit quality, and further deposit growth momentum. These favorable trends helped to counter act the decline in a net interest margin over the past year.", "Total revenue declined compared to both prior quarter and prior year entirely due to the lower net interest income, much of which was anticipated, as the prolonged low interest rate environment continues to pressure asset yields. Partially offsetting this was an improvement in non-interest income driven by an increase in mortgage and capital markets related revenue.", "Current quarter expenses were relatively stable to the adjusted level in the fourth quarter as seasonally higher personnel costs were offset by reductions in most other operating expense categories, though portion of these declines were seasonal or non-recurring in nature. More importantly, expenses were down 3% from the prior year adjusted level as a result of continued expense management efforts, lower operating costs -- lower operating losses, and the sale of RidgeWorth.", "The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjustable tangible efficiency ratio of 64.4% for the current quarter slightly below the first quarter of last year. As we noted in January, year-over-year improvements in 2015 will be less than last year as we continue to work towards our goal of being sub-63 for the full year.", "Average performing loans were stable sequentially due in part to loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated pay down activity in the current quarter, but also due to our strategic focus on overall returns. While we remain confident in our loan production capacity and improving the economic conditions in our markets and businesses, our focus on returns will remain high, and may impact ultimate on balance sheet loan growth.", "Average client deposits were up 3% compared to the prior quarter with broad-based growth across consumer, private wealth, and wholesale businesses. Our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by improved focus, better execution, and enhanced capabilities.", "Asset quality continues to be an area of strength. Non-performing loans were down 3% from prior quarter, and 34% from prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points, relatively stable to the prior quarter and year.", "Our capital position improved with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Also tangible book value per share continues to steadily increase up 2% sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year.", "Lastly, our capital plan that we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process, received no objection by the Federal Reserve. Our common stock dividend will increase 20% subject to Board approval, and we will repurchase $875 million worth of common stock over the coming five quarters, which is 55% higher than our previous share buyback authorization. We're pleased that our strong capital position, improved earnings power, and reduced risk profile enabled this positive outcome for our shareholders.", "So to recap year-over-year trends; net interest income declined, most of which was related to the anticipated step-down in the commercial loan swap income, non-interest income trends are solid, and it more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenues.", "And lastly, expenses continued to be well-managed, and asset quality is strong, both of which played an important role in mitigating the pressure on the margin, and thus keeping us on an overall positive trajectory.", "So with that as overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thank you, Bill. Good morning everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis, and $0.05 or 7% higher than the first quarter of last year. The sequential decline was driven by lower net interest income and seasonally higher compensation expenses, and was partially offset by higher mortgage-related income and lower provision expense.", "Compared to the first quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by the continued expense discipline, a lower provision expense, and higher mortgage and capital markets related revenue, which together more than offset the decline in net interest income, and the return to a more normal tax rate. In addition, certain discrete recoveries, which I will discuss later also contributed to the solid year-over-year EPS growth.", "We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail, starting on Slide 5. Net interest income declined $73 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in commercial loan swap income and two fewer days, but also impacted by higher premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio. Net interest margin declined 13 basis points, primarily due to lower swap income, and the higher premium amortization expense, but also due to continued core margin pressure as a result of the low interest rate and competitive environment.", "Relative to the guidance we provided in January, the higher premium amortization expense negatively impacted NIM more than we had anticipated, as ten-year rates declined another 30 basis points sequentially. Conversely, mortgage-related revenues benefited from the decline in rates, which I will discuss later.", "Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income declined seven basis points as new production yields continued to be lower than portfolio yields. We remain focused on ensuring that we both meet the full suite of our wholesale clients' needs, and also our own internal requirements. When we cannot achieve this we will look to either exit the lending relationship via targeted loan sales as we've done in the past couple of quarters, or simply not participate during future renewal opportunities.", "On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $64 million, primarily driven by the same factors as the sequential drivers, but partially mitigated by 7% average earning asset growth.", "Looking forward, and all else equal, we expect second quarter net interest margin to decline approximately two to four basis points from the first quarter level, driven primarily by lower C&I loan yields. We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates.", "Moving on to Slide 6, adjusted non-interest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage production and trading income, which offset seasonal declines in other non-interest income categories. Mortgage production income increased $22 million, due to higher production volume as a result of elevated refinance activity and improved gain on sale margins. On the other hand, mortgage servicing income declined to $10 million as the K expense increased, given the first quarter decline in market rates.", "Investment banking income declined $12 million sequentially largely due to typical patterns of client activity between the fourth and first quarter. However, the $97 million in investment banking income this quarter is a record for a first quarter, with particular strength in investment grade debt and equity capital markets businesses. Trading income increased $15 million as a result of both higher client activity levels and the negative valuation adjustments in the prior quarter.", "Service charges for the deposits and card fees were collectively down $13 million, due both to fewer days in the quarter and reduced incidence rates. Other non-interest income was higher, almost entirely due to an $18 million pre-tax gain recognized upon the sale of legacy affordable housing properties. As you'll recall, we recognized an impairment last year when we made the decision to exit these properties. Market values are now higher and those sales are now largely complete.", "Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income increased $12 million, as higher production income and capital markets related revenue more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth income.", "Moving on to expenses, adjusted non-interest expense increased $16 million relative to prior quarter. Personnel expense increased a $100 million sequentially, as a result of typical first quarter FICO and 401k costs, as well as the return to more normal levels, and incentives, and benefit accruals.", "Outside processing and software costs declined $17 million as the fourth quarter had elevated expenses mostly due to normal timing patterns of rendering service, and costs associated with replacing specific software. Marketing and customer development expense also declined $16 million due to typical seasonality.", "Other non-interest expense declined $35 million, due to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter; alongside, $17 million of discreet recoveries realized in the first quarter. Operating losses declined $15 million on an adjusted basis in part due to recoveries of previously recorded mortgage-related losses.", "Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest expense was down 3%, driven by a combination of the sale of RidgeWorth, discreet recoveries in the current quarter, and our continued overall discipline around expense management.", "As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 64.4% in the first quarter, 50 basis points better than last year. We delivered this improvement despite the expected $50 million step-down in commercial loan swap income, as adjusted expenses were lower by 3%. As we have noted before, improvement in 2015 will be more challenging, given our significant progress last year, in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year. However, our performance this quarter demonstrates solid progress towards our goal.", "We continue to remain focused on the efficiency ratio and our goal of being below 63% for the full year, and as such, we will continue to exhibit strong expense discipline in light of the current revenue environment.", "Turning to Slide 9; our asset quality performance continues to be strong, non-performing loans declined 3% sequentially, and are down 34% compared to the prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points in the first quarter, stable with previous quarterly levels as charge-offs continue to stay low. However, recoveries were lower than the run rate experienced in 2014.", "With respect to our energy portfolio, we have not seen any meaningful delinquencies or defaults. During the quarter, we updated credit ratings, resulting in some migration, and we expect that to be ongoing, which is why we have proactively built reserves for this portfolio.", "Our allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $44 million and $19 million respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality combined with the lower loan growth during the quarter. Over the near term, we expect further though moderating declines in non-performing loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio.", "Net charge-off ratios are likely to remain within the 30 to 40 basis point range in the near term, though any given quarter may be impacted by discreet items particularly driven to those low overall net charge-off rates. We now expect full year 2015 provision expense to be below full year 2014 expense, as asset quality continues to improve, which s modestly better than our previous guidance.", "As you know, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in our loan portfolio combined with a view on future economic conditions.", "Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were stable relative to last quarter, as a result of loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated pay downs in the first quarter, in addition to lower production as a result of our continued focus on returns. C&I loan growth, while somewhat slower, was positive and broad based, driven by our corporate, commercial and small business clients. Consumer direct loans were also nicely higher, given continued growth in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership.", "As you'll recall, we sold $2 billion of loans in the prior quarter, which impacted sequential average growth rates. In addition, we moved approximately $400 million of loans to held-for-sale in the current quarter, which modestly impacted end of period growth.", "On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $5.1 billion or 4%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios outside of the residential, guaranteed student, and indirect auto portfolios where the declines are consistent with our balance sheet optimization goals of better diversification and higher returns.", "Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. We will also continue to keep the high focus on improving returns, and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.", "Turning to deposit performance; average client deposits were up $3.6 billion or 3%, compared to the prior quarter, and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall focus on meeting our clients' deposits and payment needs, supplemented by investment in client-facing platforms and people across both our consumer and private wealth, and wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by three basis points compared to the prior year.", "Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio estimated on a fully phased-in basis, increased to 9.8%.", "Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter, and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2015 CCAR process. The capital plan includes the share buyback program of up to $875 million over the coming five quarters, which will be conducted relatively evenly on a quarterly basis, in addition to a 20% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.20 to $0.24, subject to Board approval. Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016 requirement of 90%.", "With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.", "Bill Rogers", "Okay. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll start on our Slide 13. In our consumer and private wealth management segment, revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year, due predominantly the higher net interest income. Average loans have been relatively flat, however, we've had solid growth in our higher return portfolios such as consumer direct and credit cards, which has offset the intentional reductions we've made in the indirect auto and guaranteed student portfolios. This shift in portfolio mix is consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company.", "Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was 7% year-over-year deposit growth. Our improvements in deposit growth can be attributed to a more relentless focus supplemented by additional teammate investment, particularly in our mass affluent high net worth segment, and better technology with our SummitView platform, being one of the notable examples.", "Non-interest income declined 6% compared to the prior quarter, largely due to seasonal declines in service charges and card fees. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income was essentially flat.", "While retail investment income growth diminished a bit, the quality of this income line is improving as a higher percentage is related to client assets under management versus more transaction-based revenue. Growing wealth management related income overall continues to be a strategic priority.", "Expenses were up 2%, compared to the prior year, largely due to increased outside processing costs and certain discrete non-recurring charges. Staff expenses remained relatively flat, as ongoing efficiency savings offset continued investments associated with the revenue growth initiatives.", "Lastly, despite solid 4% year-over-year growth and pre-provision net revenue, net income was down 3% as provision expense increased due to moderating asset quality improvements. However, overall asset quality continues to be very strong in this segment.", "So to recap, this is a difficult operating environment for this business as you know, but we're generating good core momentum for the long-term. In the near term, continued expense discipline will be important to help combat the revenue pressures associated with low interest rates and consumer service charges.", "Turning to whole sale, whole sale banking continues to be a key growth engine for the company. Looking at the numbers on an adjusted basis, net income was up 18% year-over-year, driven by solid revenue growth and further asset quality improvement.", "Adjusted revenue grew 8% relative to the prior year. Net interest income was up 9%, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth, though this was partially offset by a decline in loan spreads. Loan growth was 2% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, driven by growth across most of our client segments. However, given the competitive environments and continued low rate environment, C&I production yields continued to be pressured, and as such, we reduced growth or sold loans in the areas that are not meeting our long-term return hurdles.", "Deposits were up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, and the success here can be attributed to enhancements and our treasury and payment product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist hires, both allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients deposit meets.", "Adjusted non-interest income was up 6% over the prior year, driven by higher investment banking and trading revenue reflecting the investments that we've made in talent and capabilities to increase our market share. Authentications and leverage finance volumes were down year-over-year, investment grade debt and equity capital markets at record quarters, and overall, as Aleem mentioned, this was our best first quarter for investment banking income. This overall performance is a testament to the enhanced diversity of our platform both by product and industry, and as a result of the continuous investments we've made in the business.", "Going forward, we're focused on leveraging investments in SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to better meet the capital markets and advisory needs of our commercial banking CRE and private wealth clients. Adjusted non-interest expense was higher year-over-year largely due to the investments in CIB; however, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio which is very accretive to the overall company.", "Overall, we continue to believe that our wholesale banking business is highly differentiated, and our value proposition continues to be very well received by clients. Lower loan yields will continue to be a challenge, and we're working hard to mitigate that impact by being more selective about utilization of the balance sheet in addition to continue to expand our fee income and deposit opportunities.", "Looking forward, our clients remain confident, our investment banking backlog and loan and deposit pipelines are healthy, and we remain bullish on the overall growth and profitability outlook for the segment.", "Now moving to the mortgage segment, where we had another good quarter. Adjusted net income was stable to the prior quarter, but up 42 million over the prior year. Our expense base continues to decline while our risk profile is improving, both of which are key components of our strategy in this business.", "In addition, a strong refinance environment boosted production income in the first quarter. Getting into the details, revenues were up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher mortgage production income as a result of a 64% increase in production volume and higher gain on sale margins. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were basically flat. The higher production income was offset by higher decay in the servicing portfolio, and lower spreads on the loan portfolio, a reflection of natural hedge within the business.", "While mortgage production volume was up 8% sequentially, application volume was up 48%, which should support elevated levels of production income into the near term. The current refinance environment will abate when rates begin to rise, however, we expect purchase volume and our operating market will continue to strength, given overall economic conditions. Our expectation is supported by purchase volume and applications being up 16% and 30% respectively year-over-year.", "Adjusted expenses were down 5% sequentially and year-over-year despite higher revenue, primarily due to declines in operating losses and another cyclical cause. Additionally, asset quality continues to improve with delinquencies, non-performers, and net charge-offs continuing on a declining trend.", "So to summarize the quarter for the overall company, we had a solid momentum across each of our businesses, which help mitigate the impact of the persistently low interest rate environment on our net interest margin. Our focus on returns will remain a priority, and the capacity we build throughout the company should help us to continue and deliver profitable growth.", "In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and improve our efficiency ratio. This expense discipline will also be important to help fund continued growth investments, many of which are already yielding positive results, so that we can continue to deliver long-term value for our clients and our shareholders.", "Now with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thank you, Bill. Arlene, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.", "Ken Usdin", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, Ken.", "Ken Usdin", "You've now had the third solid quarter of expense control under $1.3 billion, and clearly there was that $17 million recovery, and you also mentioned the operating losses were much lower. I was wondering as you look out now, have you gotten us down to a sub 1.3 quarterly expense run rate, and if not, what are the upward pressures that we would see from here?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, Ken, this is Bill. As you pointed out, we've been operating clearly at the low end of a range we established, which was sort of a $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. And I think we will continue in that lower end of our range, and I think a $1.3 billion subject to some variation is honing in on more of the right number, given where we are in this environment.", "Ken, you know how focused we are on the efficiency ratio, and if you do the math when you look at the decline in revenues and so what the revenue environment looks like for us to hit our efficiency ratio targets, we'll have to keep a tight lid on expenses, and therefore the bottom end of that range looks more likely relative to the size of the full range we had previously given.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay. And Aleem my follow-up just on a comment you\u2019d made last quarter, you had been talking previously about running also in the 1.2 billion-ish on NII. This quarter it looks like you started a little bit below that, maybe partly because of day count, but kind of a same follow-up just where we kind of also stuck at this sub 1.2 level, just given where we are in the rate environment for now?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think yes, the day count was an issue this quarter, Ken, and also the premium amortization this quarter on the securities portfolio was an issue just given the big lurch down in rates that we got this quarter, 30 basis points on the ten-year.", "So I think if you take those two things out, and I think about what NII looks like over the course of the remainder of the year, you know what we've been actually very successful in holding NII stable despite declining margins for many quarters until we got to this quarter, we got to step-down this quarter because of the decline in swap income, but from here I would think that we are -- if this isn't the trough in NII, then this is very close to the trough.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John McDonald from Bernstein. Sir, your line is open.", "John McDonald", "Yes, hi, good morning. I was wondering on the mortgage side, the production revenues as you noted were quite strong on both volume and margins. I was wondering if you could offer any color on the timing of the volume pick-up, was that steady throughout the quarter, was it sporadic based on where rates were? And then on the gain on sale margins, any numerical context you could offer for how strong your gain on sale margins have been, and what's been driving that? And do think you can hold these gain on sale margins here?", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi, John. Yes, I think that we saw that decline in rates early in the quarter, and that helped us on mortgage revenue overall, and production volumes were generally steady throughout the quarter. Margins picked up a little bit early in the quarter and sort of, I think, held relatively steady also fairly throughout the quarter.", "So if rates are where they are, then I would expect this to continue for a while, but also the refi benefit I think continues to decline a little, just given how many of our clients have already refied. And over time, the benefit we expect to see from an improving economy is actually our clients moving more and more toward a purchase market, and we are looking forward to seeing that happen.", "John McDonald", "Okay.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, I'm more excited about the purchase opportunity going forward. I mean the refi thing, with service in [decay] [ph] it sort of tends to even itself out a little bit. So I mean the real long-term sustainable growth comes from purchase. And what we're seeing maybe it\u2019s unique to our markets, but we're seeing really good activity on the purchase side.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thanks. And a follow-up just to Ken's question, Aleem, in terms of the premium amortization, do you get that all back one-for-one if the ten-year climbs back and your outlook for the second quarter, the two to four basis points of margin, does that assume any recapture of the premium amortization you lost this quarter?", "Aleem Gillani", "If rates climb, we'll get some of it back. We probably won't get it all back on a one-for-one basis, John, but we're not anticipating a major rate hike in the next quarter or two.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.", "Rob Placet", "Hi, good morning. This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. First question just on investment banking, revenues continued to be strong there. I was just curios if you could provide an outlook on a full year basis, what we should expect there?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, we don't tend to provide a full year outlook as it relates to that particular line, but that being said, given what we see right now in pipelines, given what we see in activity, what we\u2019re feeling from our clients, we continue to feel really good about that business. It's got quarter-to-quarter type fluctuations. But if you do sort of a straight line for us over multi-quarter, you're seeing a continued improvement, and given the investments we've made there, the receptivity from our clients I don't see a reason that wouldn't continue.", "Rob Placet", "Okay, great. And then just similar question on deposit service charges; they were a bit weaker than I think we were expecting, so I was just curious if you can provide an outlook on that line time?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. They were a little bit lower, primarily again, we had two fewer days this quarter, as well as we're seeing changes in client behavior. Our clients are consolidating accounts and they're looking to try to find ways of avoiding fees. And we're working with them to do that. We're educating our clients on what they can do. And we think that over the long run that's going to help our overall client relationships and help build the franchise.", "So if I look at deposit service charges over the remaining part of the year, they will be driven a little by client behavior, but I think we're looking for ways to try and work with our clients. And this is not going to be an overall growth area for the company, but we are looking to try and find ways to work with our clients and help them manage their exposure, and we think that will help our relationships in the long-term.", "Bill Rogers", "They're obviously inversely related to deposit growth. We've seen really good deposit growth in not only new account acquisition, but just increase in balances and individual accounts.", "Rob Placet", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning.", "Ryan Nash", "All right. Can you tell me little bit about the loan growth you saw this quarter, where the slowdown came from, particularly on the commercial side which is where I think you have one of your slowest quarters in a while, just how big were the elevated pay downs in the quarter?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, I'll take that Ryan. C&I was up about 2% this quarter overall. In most of our core verticals, we continue to see some pretty good growth. Some exceptions to that, particularly in areas where we've been focused on returns, equipment leasing would be one of those. Some of that's involved with the loan sale of some muni assets that we just didn't see being as strategic long-term as we wanted.", "CRE was flat this quarter. That was mainly from pay downs, and that sort of is a two-edge sword. I mean the one edge is it reduces the growth a little bit, but the other edge is it's a nice confirmation of our business. So we got pay downs from construction activity, and investor demand being very good. So the things that we're financing are very financeable in the secondary market. So that's positive.", "I think going forward on the C&I side, I mean we continue to be positive. I think the pay downs were probably a little higher this quarter than certainly than we've seen in the past. Production engines will continue to be positive, might not be at the same level as last year, but it continues to grow.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Aleem, you noted two to four basis points of NIM pressure in the second quarter; just given the focus on relationship pricing, clearly seen, are you still under pressure? Do you think that two to four is going to be a good run rate option, any changes to the swap portfolio to the remainder of the year? Or could we actually see the pressure start to ease, like I said just given the focus on getting better pricing across your customer base?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I think that's a question about sort of economy and markets. And if the economic growth picks up, and I think that amount of decline will decline. But if we stay as we are, all else equal, I would think that kind of a margin decline two or three basis points a quarter is about sort of a kind of grind down that we would continue to see, given run-offs and new production over the remainder of the year.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Erika Najaria", "Yes. Hi, good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Hi, Erica.", "Erika Najarian", "My first question is actually a follow-up to Ryan's question, so throughout your prepared remarks you mentioned several times that you continue to want to keep your return hurdle tied, you think about balance sheet growth, and you also noted that C&I loan growth may not be as strong as last year, at the same time wholesale banking continues to be strong and your particular market are also quite strong. As we think about loan growth for the balance of the year, compared to last year, and we mix all of those together, could you still have accelerating loan growth despite some of what you've pointed out?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Erica, yes, I think we can have good loan growth in our markets. You know the markets we are in, where we've got great opportunity. We've certainly put a lot of investment in great talent that we've been fortunate enough to bring in over the last couple of years. I think that's going to help us on the loan growth side. But to your question about returns, I think along with loan growth and net interest income of course is fee income. And I think our strategy around being able to grow non-interest income from bad client base to whom we provide a value proposition that they like, I think we've been able to demonstrate that we've been able to deliver that, and it gives a testament to the talent we brought in. And our investment banking results this quarter I think demonstrate that strategy is working well for us.", "Bill Rogers", "And I think there is no putting breaks on the production engines. We'll continue to fire on all cylinders in making sure that we are seeing the kind of opportunities we want to see. One of the big trade-offs in the overall balances are in the consumer private loan side, and I really like the trade. Our consumer direct business was up about 9% and our indirect was down about 8%, and I like that trade. It's more client-related business, it's higher margin business and continued sort of equal credit quality. So I think that kind of trade on the balance sheet particularly as it relates to consumer side is something that we'll continue to be focused on.", "Erika Najarian", "Understood. And just for my second question, taking a step back; M&A is a bigger topic with bank investors today than even a quarter ago, given your level of excess capital and the environment being challenging for all banks, do you see yourself as a potential acquirer over the next 12 to 18 months? And how has that mindset perhaps changed versus, let's say, a year ago?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, I think the continued investment right now is in our business. The bank that we like the most is SunTrust. We've got third biggest retail operation in our markets, the fourth largest mortgage company. We've got great momentum in our investment banking operations. So we are going to continue to invest in those things, funded by some of the expense savings and opportunities that we are creating.", "I presume without the green light if we wanted to do something on the M&A side, where we think about things that are potentially accretive to a really strong franchise, yes, but those are not a lot of them. So, 12 and 18 months is a long time. Our focus right now continues to be highly and mostly focused on SunTrust.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Hi, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck", "Just couple of quick follow-ups; one was on the loan sales this that you did this quarter, did you slice them [ph]?", "Bill Rogers", "I'm sorry, Betsy. I didn't hear the\u2026", "Betsy Graseck", "Did you slice how much the loan sales were? I'm just wondering what the growth was ex the loan sales.", "Bill Rogers", "All right. We sold $2 billion towards the end of Q4. And in Q1, we moved another $400 million into held-for-sale.", "Betsy Graseck", "And then, I'm just also wondering is, are you through that process? Is there more to come? How you're making decision which ones to sell, relative value on the risk adjusted margins, just to bring [ph], but how far along in the process you're?", "Aleem Gillani", "You're exactly right. We're looking for relative value. We're looking for lower ROA or ROE loans. We're also looking for loans that as Bill said earlier are more in the indirect space, loans where we don't have a client relationship with that client. We refined loans that fit those categories. We'd rather put our capital to work for clients where we do have a relationship, and where we get returns to hit our hurdle rates.", "Betsy Graseck", "And so just that basic question is that are you pretty much donor, or this is ongoing which you expect a type of level of loan sales that happen on a quarterly basis?", "Aleem Gillani", "We're doing an ongoing research, Betsy. And if we find portfolios of loans that fit our sale category, then we'll be continuing to look for exit on those loans and put our money to work where we think it actually makes more sense. If you go back over the last couple of years, I think you'll see sort of us on a pretty steady basis, moving lower ROA assets out of our balance sheet, not to somebody else's.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, and the follow-up is just on the impact of some of the regulatory rules around; leverage lending, and I know you have a very strong business there. Maybe you could speak to how you see that shaking out, especially as energy has pulled back a bit in terms of need for funding?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, I think you're certainly seeing some shake out of the market. That's not the biggest driver of our income going forward. It has been a driver. I think we've participated in a very thoughtful way that's very consistent with our strategy of being highly diversified, and both inter and intra parts of our portfolio. I think overall it's positive. Overall I think we're seeing a little bit of a pull back to what we've seen a couple of quarters ago, and I think overall for business in general, that's a positive, and it will be a positive for us.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.", "John Pancari", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, John.", "John Pancari", "I just wanted to get a little more color on what all the detail that you gave around loan growth and the pay down etcetera, and what that means for overall growth in coming quarters? I know there's been some questions about it on the call already, but is it fair to assume that you're going to be in a growth rate in the mid single-digit as you have been in prior quarters, or are the pay downs and some of your selectivity and what you're putting on the balance sheet, could that weigh on it near term or we could be looking at low single-digits?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, I think, John, the important part is we're going to grow in the areas that we want to continue to grow at. And they have been growing. If we look at areas like core commercial and our corporate banking business, and as I said virtually all of our verticals, we were seeing real growth. We would expect that to continue. That's been offset a little bit this quarter, maybe uniquely by higher pay downs in the CRE sides, which we discussed, which again sort of on balance I view as positive in terms of the confirmation of our business model, and then also with the decision that we made in the fourth quarter relative to particular loan sales.", "So trust me, as I said earlier, we're not putting brakes on loan growth. I mean we'll continue to be very positive about the businesses we're in. We're very positive about the markets we're in, and continue to see opportunities in that area. And much of what we're doing is meeting our hurdle requirements, and a lot of it's meeting our hurdle requirements because of the investments we've made on the fee-based side. The fact that we have come a long way from a spread-only business, we're able to generate a lot more income of the commitments that we make on the asset side.", "So we continue to feel good about the capacity to generate loan growth in this company, and I think the first quarter is just a little bit above an aberration in the sense of pay downs and then fourth quarter loan sales that are all culminating in one particular quarter.", "Aleem Gillani", "John, if you go back last year, you'd see that we were putting on about $2.5 billion of organic loan growth every quarter. And if you wanted to continue to generate that, given the strength of our production engines, I'm sure we could easily do that. The issue is at what returns. And given our focus on overall returns, I don't think that we will choose to grow loans at the same rate that we were last quarter; certainly not the rate of Q1 '15, but probably somewhere in the middle between where we were this quarter and where we were last year.", "John Pancari", "I'm sorry, Aleem, you just said, versus fourth quarter last year?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, all of last year, we were putting on an average of about $2.5 billion of loan growth per quarter.", "John Pancari", "Yes, okay. All right. And then my follow-ups in the expense side; thanks for the detail around the overall $1.3 billion level. In getting there, I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the different components, specifically operating losses, obviously came in lower than expected. The outside processing and software costs also lower, and then I know credit and collection was lower and that was part of your other classification. So for those types of items, all fair to assume they stay low and they're the main drivers of your confidence around this $1.3 billion?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, there was a little benefit in operating losses this quarter. That was sort of little bit of a one-off, but overall we're focused on every one of those lines, we continue to work with our teammates across the company around improving overall efficiency ratio, finding dollars of expenses that we can cut in those contexts. We've talked in the past about all of our various strategies, all of the things that we're focused on to continue to manage expenses and grow efficiency. And we talk less about those now, but that doesn't mean that had gone away. We continue to focus on that, and I expect that we'll continue to do that over the remainder of the year, John.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, John you mentioned a few line items which are somewhat cyclical by nature. And I think continuing the trends that we're on, we should overall, maybe not quarter-to-quarter, but overall see those continue to go down as the quality of our portfolio improves. But then as Aleem pointed out, there is everything else. This is the core way we run our business. I mean lots of focus on operations costs, looking at lending centers, call centers, technology infrastructure, end-to-end focus, and virtually all of our businesses, corporate real estate consolidation, use the third-party, the vendor management, the list goes on. We're highly focused on more than two or three lines that relates improving that expense line. But we also noted, the focus is on the efficiency ratio because we're all fantastic, so we're sort of in the \"Save a dollar, invest a dollar,\" kind of mood right now, because we see lots of opportunities to continue to invest in our company for long-terms growth. And we're going to be careful about hitting that right balance of not cutting in to the sort of the core revenue capacity opportunity in our company; again, which I think are significant long-term.", "John Pancari", "Yes, got it. Thank you.", "Bill Rogers", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. ", "Jason Harbes", "Hi, good morning. Actually it's Jason Harbes from Matt's team.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Jason Harbes", "Good morning guys. So yes, first question is just on the swaps. Looks like you upgraded the guidance by about 10% for the full year. Just curious what's driving that and what your appetite would be to purchase additional swaps within the context of rates potentially rising later this year.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I'm not sure rates will rise later this year. But yes, as you noted we did add a little bit more into that portfolio. But remember how many we had rolled off in the first quarter, and given the way that our portfolio looks structurally, and if we did nothing at all, 60% of our overall loans would be floating rates. We continue to want to add swaps to move some of that portfolio to what looks like fixed rates. And as a result of the swaps that we have on the book now, we're more like 50-50. We've got what I think today is a nice balanced that prepares us to be asset sensitive for some point in the future.", "I'm not so sure that point in the future is going to be soon, i.e., in the next few months, but I think is you look at 2016 and '17, our investors are going to want us to be asset sensitive, and I think swap structure and overall structural rate book allows us to be nicely asset sensitive at that point.", "Bill Rogers", "And I think Aleem mentioned that we mentioned in January, coming into this year, we geared our planning process. I'm not thinking about a rate increase. So when we talk about efficiency ratio, we talk about the things that we have control of, we're assuming we're going to be in a low rate environment. Now, if that changes, we obviously get the benefit of that, and we're obviously positioned for that long-term, but I would not dependant on a rate increase, for example, to hit our sub\u201363 efficiency ratio.", "Jason Harbes", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then to switch over for my follow-up on the credit card business, looks like you're making nice progress there. Can you comment specifically on what you're seeing there and maybe share any insights into the appetite of your customers to revolve balances?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. It is part of that; a direct portfolio that were seeing grow on our consumer side, and we're actually very pleased with what we seeing on the credit card side. Not only way we're putting more cards, and everybody's wallet was actually being on that track now pretty consistently for about 12 to 18 months. But as you point out, we're actually now starting to see utilization. So some of the things that we're doing to activate that with different campaigns and process that we're running to making sure that we've got reward programs and et cetera that are highly competitive, and we're just seeing clients starting to shift that is their overall usage to a more fulsome relationship that they have with SunTrust versus maybe a single relationship they have with somebody else with the cards in their wallets. So I'm hopeful that trend will continue, and I like the momentum we've established.", "Jason Harbes", "Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Sir, your line is open.", "GerardCassidy", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "GerardCassidy", "Can you share with us on your ability to purchase up to $875 million, now, of your common shares between the second quarter 2015 and 2016? Is that going to be a straight line even amount per quarter, or will it be variable? And plus, if some opportunity came up to buy stock more aggressively, if it's not in your CCAR plan, can you still do it, or do you have to apply to the regulators to say that you want to do it?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, Gerard, I'll answer your second question first. Overall, program is regulated quite rigorously. So if we wanted to make dramatic changes, I'm sure we would be having a conversation.", "And coming to your first question, I expect that to be relatively even over the five-quarter period, and the first quarter of this year, we repurchased a $115 million of stock. And I'm pleased with the increase over the next few quarters that was not objected too, and I'm glad that we'll be able to bring that stock in.", "GerardCassidy", "Coming back to your Tier 1 common ratio, which is very strong at 9.8%, first, what are you comfortable at running at? And second, I know this is putting the cart before the horse, but for next year's CCAR program, if you feel you have excess capital, what is the possibility or probability that you'd ask for -- to buy back more than your current earnings, which American Express, for example, did this year?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, I like what we were able to do this year, Gerard; we took our overall payout ratio from the 50% range up to the 70% range. So that was nice to be able to do. And given the context of continued loan growth, we would need to retain some level of capital in order to be able to support the loan growth that we are going to get this year.", "As I look forward to where we think we can be at some point in the future, I do think like you, that 9.8% overall, and remember this is on a fully phased-in basis. That's probably more than we'll need, and I would hope that over the course of the medium term, that the regulators would allow the industry to be able to shrink capital level overall. If I think about where we could end up in that type of environment, I think that we would likely end up as some kind of ratio below nine; something that starts with an eight probably seems like it would be certainly adequate for the need that we have as a company to support our client needs, and be able to withstand the rigorous CCAR stress test.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. I appreciate the answers, Aleem. Thank you.", "Ankur Vyas", "Aleem, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Sir, your line is open.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Good morning. A couple of questions on fee income; firstly on mortgage, I'm getting a sense that you're gaining share there, and if so, how are you doing it?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, I think maybe the -- if we sort of think about it on a global basis or national basis, I think our marks up is just better. We are seeing, we are covering our markets, particularly on the purchase side. So on a national type basis, I would presume that we'd be gaining share because I think our economy is gaining share in our markets relative to the total economy. So I think the answer to that is probably yes. And we continue to add LOMs [ph] to our platform. I mean we like what we're doing, we're optimistic about the future. We like the way our business is operating. So we will continue to make those types of investments, but just overall I think our markets are just better. And we will continue to invest in technology in the platform. And as we continue to do that, we make it easier and easier for our clients to do business with us, and for our teammates to support those clients. So that past investments I think is paying off in terms of client delight with our products.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And then in the release, you touched on a slowdown in syndicated finance activity, and you mentioned leverage lending being a little bit lighter. What do you think is behind that? Is it demand? Is it regulators getting tougher, is it something else?", "Aleem Gillani", "I think a little bit of that is just seasonality, Q1 versus Q4. It's a little bit of a standard thing that clients move ahead in Q4, perhaps late in the year to close our transactions. So I think a little bit of that is seasonality, but I think we were able to more than offset that decline in that space with growth in other aspects of our investment banking business that allowed us to generate the results that we got this quarter.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Ankur Vyas", "Okay, thanks everyone. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining us today.

Any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "Now, I would like to turn over the meeting to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to SunTrust\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed on our website at investors.suntrust.com.

These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.

The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks, Ankur and good morning everyone. I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter then I am going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem\u2019s comments, I will review our performance at the business segment level.", "We delivered strong results this quarter as we made further progress against our key strategies, which include optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing our capital return to shareholders. Earnings per share, after excluding $0.11 of non-core items, were $0.89 and up a solid 10% compared to the adjusted level a year ago. Our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts improved our overall earning asset and funding mix, resulting in an 8 basis point improvement in net interest margin and $44 million sequential increase in net interest income.", "Period-end loans were up 1% driven largely by growth in higher return consumer portfolios resulting in a more diversified and profitable loan mix. We remain confident in our ability to generate additional and targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate when we can have deeper relationships. However, we will continue to closely manage areas that are not meeting our thresholds and according with our goal of improving the overall returns of the company.", "Average deposits were up 2% sequentially as our core growth initiatives continue to gain momentum. Growing deposits, while also maintaining appropriate pricing discipline, remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. In addition, our strong deposit growth has allowed us to significantly reduce our higher cost wholesale funding over the last 6 months.", "The sequential decline in non-interest income was driven by lower capital markets and mortgage production income, primarily the result of a strong second quarter, but also the result of challenging market conditions during the third quarter. Relative to the prior year, adjusted non-interest income increased 2% primarily due to our continued success in meeting more of our clients\u2019 capital markets needs. This is further evidence of our differentiated wholesale banking platform and the positive returns we are realizing on our investments in this segment. Expenses were stable relative to prior year at down 5% versus the prior quarter. While some of the sequential decline was nonrecurring and seasonal in nature, we continue to carefully manage expenses given this revenue environment.", "Our performance this quarter resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 61% for the third quarter and 62.9% year-to-date. As you all know, we have been working diligently toward our goal of sub 63% for the full year and we took another step in the right direction this quarter. Improving efficiency remains a strategic priority with a long-term goal of being sub 60%. Our asset quality performance continues to be very strong with NPLs down 4% and the net charge-off ratio declining 5 basis points to 21 basis points. This performance can be attributed to the significant actions we have taken over the past several years to de-risk, diversify and improve the quality of our loan production. However, we also recognize that our provision expense is at very low levels and will eventually normalize. Our capital position improved slightly with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.9% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. We are able to improve our capital position, while also returning nearly 60% of our earnings to shareholders this quarter.", "So to recap, we delivered solid bottom line results that further enhance shareholder value this quarter with return on assets and return on tangible common equity increasing to 1.1% and 12.8% respectively and tangible book value per share increasing 4% sequentially. Our strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency continue to yield positive results, creating value for our clients and shareholders.", "So with that as an overview, I am going to turn over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter\u2019s performance.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the third quarter, was $1 even, which compares to $0.89 in the previous quarter and $0.81 on an adjusted basis last year. We recognized $0.07 of discrete tax benefits this quarter, which were recorded as a lower provision for income taxes in addition to $0.04 of discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters, which were recorded in non-interest expense.", "Excluding these non-recurring benefits, earnings per share were $0.89 and relatively stable to the second quarter as higher net interest income and lower non-interest expense were mostly offset by lower non-interest income. Compared to the third quarter of last year, core earnings per share grew 10% driven by a lower loan loss provision, higher capital markets and mortgage-related income and solid loan and deposit growth. All of which helps to counteract the 9 basis point decline in the net interest margin during that time frame.", "We will now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 4% sequentially driven by lower premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio, lower wholesale funding and higher commercial loan swap income. Each of which is a reflection of our continued efforts to actively manage and optimize our balance sheet. Net interest margin improved 8 basis points, primarily due to the same factors that drove the increase in net interest income, in addition to improved core loan yields and loan mix.", "Relative to the guidance we provided in July, NIM was higher-than-anticipated as we retired higher cost wholesale funding and core loan yields were firm, albeit for just one quarter so far. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was fairly stable as the declines in earning asset yields were largely offset by growth in earning assets and also by the reduction in wholesale funding, which was in turn driven by the strong deposit growth we generated over the past year. Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter net interest margin to be relatively stable to the third quarter. Despite the expected stability next quarter, NIM will likely grind down in 2016 as long as interest rates remain low. Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to where net interest income would benefit from a rise in short-term rates, while also ensuring we carefully manage our risk to lower-for-longer scenarios.", "Moving on to Slide 6, non-interest income decreased $63 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the expected decline in capital markets related income given the record second quarter, coupled with increased market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking income was $115 million in the third quarter, down $30 million sequentially, but up $27 million compared to the prior year. Lower high yield and equity origination fees were the primary drivers of the sequential decline, while the strong year-over-year growth was driven by most product groups. In particular, M&A, a business we continue to grow as a result of building deeper client relationships and increased expertise.", "Trading income also declined in the third quarter as wider credit spreads and elevated volatility resulted in reduced client activity and lower valuations of inventory. Mortgage production income declined $18 million, primarily due to the anticipated decline in refinance volumes. Gain on sale margins were also lower though primarily as a result of changes in channel mix. Conversely, mortgage servicing income increased to $10 million due to lower decay expense and higher levels of core servicing fees as a result of continued steady growth in the servicing portfolio. We also recorded $7 million in net securities gains and $11 million of debt extinguishment costs, which are recorded in non-interest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had a minor upfront negative P&L impact, but will modestly improve our forward NIM and net interest income. Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income was up 2% as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income offset the decline in service charges and trust and investment management income.", "Moving on to expenses, non-interest expense declined $64 million sequentially due to lower personnel expenses in addition to discrete recoveries recognized in the third quarter. Personnel expenses declined $31 million due to the higher levels of incentive based compensation recorded in the previous quarter given strong business performance as well as declines in benefits costs and FICO taxes, some of which is seasonal. Operating losses and other non-interest expense benefited from $20 million and $12 million, respectively of separate discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters. This was partially offset by an $8 million increase in marketing expenses due to higher advertising costs. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest expense declined slightly as lower operating losses and personnel costs were partially offset by higher outside processing and software expenses.", "As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.0% in the third quarter, down 90 basis points from the last year. Year-to-date, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio is now 62.9% and puts us on track to achieve our full year goal of being sub-63%. For several years now, we have been committed to becoming a more efficient and effective company and we are highly focused on continuing to make progress toward our long-term efficiency ratio goal of sub-60%.", "Let\u2019s turn to credit quality on Slide 9. The net charge-off ratio was 21 basis points, down five basis points from the prior quarter and 18 basis points from the prior year. Non-performers also declined slightly and now represent 35 basis points of loans. While overall asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable in the near-term, future quarters will be impacted by discrete situations and sectors, given the current low levels of net charge-offs and non-performers. The allowance for loan and lease losses and the ALLL ratio declined $48 million and five basis points respectively compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality. Provision expense increased slightly as lower net charge-offs were offset by higher loan growth and a smaller reserve release.", "With regard to our energy portfolio, we took further action this quarter to build additional reserves given the decline in commodity prices. As this portfolio represents only 2% of total loans with less than half of this portfolio in the E&P and oil field services sectors, our risk here remains very manageable. Similar to the guidance we provided in the previous quarter, we will [Technical Difficulty] fourth quarter provision expense to increase sequentially, but be lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of our efforts to improve asset quality. Looking into 2016, we expect provision expense to more closely match net charge-offs as the improvements in asset quality will abate. Wholesale, net charge-offs are likely to increase from here as we do not believe the third quarter level is sustainable. Ultimately our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio combined with a view on economic conditions.", "Let\u2019s turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were relatively stable due to the $1 billion auto securitization we completed in June. Period end loans were up almost 1% relative to June 30 with growth across most loan categories. C&I loans declined slightly as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by continued elevated pay downs and further reductions in lower return portfolios. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.5 billion or 2%, driven by 6% growth in the C&I portfolio and $1.7 billion of growth in our consumer direct book as a result of continued momentum in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership. The growth in C&I and consumer direct loans was partially offset by continued pay downs in the home equity portfolio and reductions in indirect consumer loans given the competitive environment in auto lending. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients\u2019 growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and pipelines remain healthy and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.", "Turning to deposits on Slide 11, average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 10% compared to the prior year driven by growth across most lines of business. We continue to be pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients\u2019 deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client facing bankers across both the consumer private wealth and wholesale segments. In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within wholesale banking are doing an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill noted earlier our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher cost long-term debt by $4.6 billion over the past six months.", "Our broader enterprise wide focus on deposits was also evident in the recent release of FDIC deposit market share data where SunTrust grew faster than the competition and increased our national market share by four basis points. Importantly, the strong growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low cost deposit growth continues to be strong, while higher cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing our value proposition for clients.", "Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately another $250 million during Q3 as a result of growth in retained earnings and the estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased in basis increased to 9.9%. Tangible book value per share increased 4% from the prior quarter, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher unrealized gains in the securities portfolio. We repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid $0.24 dividend in the quarter per our 2015 capital plan. Our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016, 90% requirement.", "Lastly, I would like to highlight the credit rating upgrade we received from Fitch Ratings last week, which was a reflection of our improved earnings profile, strong asset quality performance and balanced and diversified business model. Our credit ratings across all three major rating agencies have generally improved over the past year, which is positive for our teammates, clients and investors.", "With that, I will now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level.", "Bill Rogers", "Great, thanks, Aleem and I will start on Slide 13. Our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment continue to demonstrate solid steady growth this quarter. Net income was up 7% over prior year driven mainly by lower provision expense. Core operating performance was also solid as pre-provision net revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year and 3% sequentially.", "Net interest income continues to steadily improve in this segment that bodes our balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans were stable sequentially as growth in higher return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card, offset the impact of the $1 billion auto securitization in June. Deposits were up 6% year-over-year with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships, particularly in our mass affluent and high net worth segments.", "Our premier bankers in SummitView platform are examples of where our investments in talent and technology have accelerated our growth. We also introduced new checking account packages in August, simultaneously simplifying and improving our product offering in addition to increasing our value proposition to students and families, consistent with our company\u2019s purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being.", "Non-interest income was down marginally compared to the prior quarter and year. Service charges remained pressured as client behavior continues to change. Wealth Management related income declined modestly this quarter given market conditions, which resulted in lower assets under management and reduced transactional activity. Irrespective of short-term market fluctuations, many more of our clients wealth and investments needs, continues to be a strategic priority for the company. Expenses in this business have been well-controlled and we have been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing technology and talent. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments with steady increases in mobile penetration, digital sales and self-service deposits with the latter representing now 26% of total deposits received in the third quarter.", "Bigger picture, the progress we have made of optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. The economies in our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets continue to perform well and we are uniquely well-positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments.", "So, let\u2019s go to wholesale next, which has been a key growth engine for the company and had a solid quarter despite challenging market conditions. Total revenue was down 6% relative to the prior quarter, but up 12% compared to prior year. The sequential quarter decline was driven by lower capital markets related income primarily because we were coming off a record second quarter, but also due in part to market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking had a third highest quarter ever and was up 31% compared to a year ago. M&A investment-grade bond originations and equity sales and trading all had strong quarters, each a reflection of the strategic investments we have been making to expand and diversify our capabilities. Strength in these product areas help to mitigate declines and high-yield bond and equity originations driven by elevated market volatility. Trading income was lower this quarter as choppy market conditions led to increased volatility, wider credit spreads and reduced client activity.", "Net interest income was up 6% year-over-year driven by strong loan and deposit growth though this was partially offset by a decline in spreads. Average loans declined 1% sequentially and increased 6% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid growth across a number of industry verticals and lines of businesses. However, this has been offset by elevated payoffs and intentional reductions in lower return areas. While the overall lending environment remains competitive, we have seen more stability in portfolio and production yields over the past few months. Production and pipeline trends are healthy and we remain focused on generating profitable growth both for SunTrust and our clients.", "Deposits were up 5% sequentially and 18% year-over-year with broad-based growth across all major lines of businesses. Our strong performance here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payment product offerings, the success of our liquidity specialist in CIB and increased intensity in meeting more of our wholesale client needs on the deposit front. Provision expense grew relative to the prior quarter and prior year as we continue to proactively increase the energy portfolio reserve given the decline in oil prices in the third quarter. With that said, SunTrust exposure to the exploration and production in oilfield services sector, which are the more severely impacted by decline in oil prices continues to represent only 1% of our total loan portfolio. Overall, asset quality in Wholesale Banking and the company continues to be very strong.", "Non-interest expense was up 6% over the prior year largely due to the continued strategic investments in CIB and improved business performance, but more importantly, wholesale\u2019s overall efficiency ratio improved relative to last year. We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated as we bring large bank capabilities and a One Team approach to mid-corporate and middle-market clients. This differentiation has led to continued growth and left lead relationships both with corporate and commercial clients giving us continued optimism in the long-term growth outlook for the Wholesale Banking segment.", "Moving to the market segment where bottom line performance was aided by approximately $50 million of non-recurring benefits, which Aleem discussed earlier. Excluding these benefits, mortgage still had a solid quarter as continued expense discipline and further de-risking, combined with a larger servicing portfolio and an improving purchase market mitigated the anticipated decline in refinance volumes.", "Revenues were relatively stable sequentially as higher servicing income help to offset the decline in production income, a reflection of the balance between servicing and production, particularly during periods of elevated refinance swings. Our servicing portfolio is up 12% compared to a year ago due largely to portfolio acquisitions as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in revenue was primarily driven by $41 million loan sale gain in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding this gain, revenue was generally stable as higher non-interest income was generally offset by lower net interest income due to a decline in loan spreads and the prior year loan sale.", "Mortgage production income increased 29%, largely due to increased purchase activity in our markets as consumer confidence continues to steadily rise and the housing market recovers. Total applications increased 20% compared to the prior year with purchase applications up 15%, evidence of the continued rebound in the housing market in addition to lower rates. Asset quality improved this quarter if net charge-offs and nonperforming loans continue to be on the downward trajectory, resulting in further declines in the residential mortgage-related allowance. And given the quality of new production combined with stable to improving housing markets, we would expect overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to trend favorably, but not necessarily at the level or pace of recent quarters.", "Expenses were lower both sequentially and year-over-year due primarily to discrete recoveries in the current quarter related to legacy matters. Excluding these items, expenses are still well-controlled as cost-saving efforts and reduced credit-related expenses have generally offset growth in production-related cost in investments and technology.", "Big picture, after years of operating and credit-related challenges, the mortgage business has become a more steady contributor to bottom line performance of the company, has also improved its focus and execution around creating a better client experience and delivering the entire bank to our mortgage clients.", "So before I conclude, I want to highlight our announcement yesterday regarding certain management changes. These changes align top talent with significant opportunities at our company and this will help sharpen our focus and enhance our growth prospects. Tom, Brad, Jerome and Dorinda are all seasoned executives and I am confident in their individual and collective capability to lead their respective units and deliver on our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being.", "So, to recap the third quarter, we made solid progress against key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing our capital return. Our active management of the balance sheet has resulted in an improved net interest income and margin. At the same time, while our asset quality performance is strong, current levels of provision expense are not sustainable in the long-term. Year-over-year non-interest income trends are solid and reflective of our strategy to meet a wider array of client needs. In addition, we are mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and also to support continued investments in our company. Overall, I remain optimistic about our company\u2019s strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value to our clients and shareholders.", "So with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur and let\u2019s take some Q&A.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thanks Bill. Angela, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so I would like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Ken Usdin", "Great. Hi, good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Ken Usdin", "Aleem, you are establishing a nice new seasonality of being able to really show expense control in the third quarter of each year. I know some of that is related to some of the comp-related fee businesses. But I know you get this question every quarter, but can you talk to us about, is this finally formally kind of a new sub 13 bar and what pressures would you see if any to kind of take you back up off this level?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, thank you for noticing Ken. No, I wouldn\u2019t say that our bar is a sub-13. I think when you think about the revenue base that we have here, core expense level of around 1.3 is about right for us as I say, at this type of revenue \u2013 this type of revenue level. But as you know, we are really just more focused on the efficiency ratio rather than on the expense number itself. And as long as we can continue to grow revenue, we are not averse to growing expenses as long as it helps revenue at a better pace and we improve our operating leverage and efficiency ratio. If we do get revenue growth in the next year or two, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see expenses move up, but continuing our trend of becoming a more efficient company. If revenue stays where it is, then think about expense levels around $1.3 billion sort of give or take.", "Ken Usdin", "Okay, got it. And my follow-up just is on this overall size of the balance sheet is really now flattened out for a good couple of quarters and you have had the sales that look like maybe they finalized out and you are kind of where you are and beyond on the securities book. So do you expect much growth at some point here on the average earning asset side or is there still more churn to happen from the mix perspective?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, from a mix perspective, there is still going to be I think, some change as we continue to try to grow our direct consumer business as well as focusing on higher return businesses across the other segments. So I think you will see a little bit of mix change still happening. We are continuing to try to work and optimize our balance sheet in every one of our businesses. In terms of overall balance sheet growth and loan growth, it will \u2013 we haven\u2019t had much loan growth in Q2. We are starting to see it pick up again a little bit in Q3. Looking forward, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see loan growth kind of at the pace we saw in Q3. That\u2019s not an unreasonable level given the relatively low economic growth that we are seeing across the country. I think the other place we might see some growth in earning assets, if you think about moving through \u201816, perhaps will be in the securities book as we need to move from sort of 90% LCR compliance rate to 100% compliance rate in 2017. And that might require some additions in HQLA and securities and you might see some growth in earning assets, but of course that will also help on the net interest income side as we grow assets.", "Ken Usdin", "Understood. Okay. Thanks Aleem.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.", "Erika Najarian", "Yes. Hi, good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning. Hi, Erika.", "Erika Najarian", "Hi. Just to follow-up to Ken\u2019s question. This management team has clearly done an excellent job managing down this efficiency ratio, but the market expectation for revenue growth for the industry seems to be tempering for 2016. And I am wondering relative to your long-term goal of below 60% efficiency, what the decision is in terms of let\u2019s say the Fed raises very slowly or doesn\u2019t raise at all in 2016 on sort of what \u2013 where are you going to attack the efficiency ratio the most aggressively, whether it\u2019s still numerators side and maybe taking down that $1.3 billion quarterly level or are you confident in what you are doing on the revenue side for next year and that there is some offset there?", "Aleem Gillani", "Erika, let me start that with sort of I think the Fed part of your question there and then maybe Bill can talk to you about the efficiency ratio approach that we have got overall. We, as you know in our case, we have sort have been in the lower for longer camp for some time and set ourselves up appropriately for that type of an approach. As we look forward into \u201816, I think also lower for longer stays, I think if there are Fed increases, they will be very deliberate and the pace of rate rise will probably be slower now than the market had been thinking six months ago. Having said that again, we are setting ourselves up so that we benefit from that type of an approach. In terms of expenses relative to revenue, we will continue to try to improve the efficiency of the company. We have been on a path now for many years. We are going to continue to be on that path. And we understand that we need to get better. So to the extent that we don\u2019t get a tailwind from rate rise, we will be looking at other ways to grow income, whether that is net interest income or non-interest income. And we will be looking for ways to manage expenses such that our efficiency ratio continues to keep us on that path of becoming more efficient.", "Bill Rogers", "Maybe a good way to look at it is sort of tale of two cities. If you look at our two largest business segments, if you look at our consumer private wealth segment, it\u2019s more rate dependent. So it has more rate variables to it. And you can see there that the top line growth in left, but we have continued to manage expenses and increase efficiency. Then you sort of shift to wholesale, which is less rate dependent and you see there that we have continue to grow the business at sort of good double-digit kind of revenue numbers and continue to increase efficiency. So the answer is to all the questions is yes. I think we want to be able to grow the business where we can grow it and all along being focused on the efficiency side. And if we see opportunities to invest and that increases expenses, while at the same time improving efficiency, we are going to do it. If we don\u2019t see those opportunities then we are going to grind down a little harder on the expense side. And that will literally be a line of business by a line of business kind of analysis and diagnosis.", "Erika Najarian", "That\u2019s clear. Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "Maybe I could ask one of the questions that was asked in a little bit of different way. So when I think about the outlook of NIM grinding lower a little bit, we shouldn\u2019t expect too much balance sheet growth just because of the strategy that\u2019s being pursued. So, on the revenue side, we are left with obviously growing fee income, but how do we think about the continued management of the asset liability management in terms of continuing to add more swaps. And then I guess related to that, despite the fact that it looks like you might have added some stocks, the asset sensitivity did go up a lot. So, can you just walk us through the puts and takes of what happened, I am assuming you have something to do with prepayment speeds in the mortgage business?", "Bill Rogers", "And maybe for you jump into the harder part of that question, I want to be clear we don\u2019t have a strategy that doesn\u2019t have growth in our balance sheet. So, what we want to do is optimize our balance sheet and business mix. So, where we see opportunities for growth in the balance sheet that are positive contributors to that strategy, we are going to absolutely take advantage of them. We haven\u2019t seen as many of those in the last couple of quarters. So, we don\u2019t have a flat balance sheet type of strategy. We have an optimized balance sheet business mix and more importantly, focus on growth and return strategy. And maybe with that said, Aleem, let me turn over to you.", "Aleem Gillani", "Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Ryan. Look, when I think about the swaps book, Ryan, I sort of think about it as the tail wagging the dog. And if you think about our overall loans, our natural position on loans is 60% of the loans that we generate and 60% of the loans that we produce are floating rates. And so that naturally makes us more and more asset sensitive every month as we continue to do new business. The tail part of this is all the swaps do is take about 12% to 14% of those floating rate loans and effectively turn them into fixed rate loans. So, in the context of our overall book, it\u2019s sort of the smaller part of that. And what we will do with the swaps and securities and which loans that we produce to emphasize and which loans we deemphasize really is going to be economy dependent, client needs as well as our view of the structural balance sheet and structural rates. So, the swap component ends up being a pretty sort of smallish part of that decision process.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. And if I could ask a follow-up on credit, I think both of you made comments, I think, Bill you said something to the extent of an eventual normalization and Aleem, you said something about 20 basis points of charge-offs not being sustainable. And I guess as you look out if rates end up staying low, you guys have done a great job de-risking the balance sheet. How should we think about a more reasonable level of charge-offs if we stay in a similar kind of environment and what does that eventually mean for the loan loss provision?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, as we think about our overall risk profile and sort of the medium-term outlook through the cycle expectation line for charge-offs is in the 40 to 70 basis point range. So, that\u2019s what we are setup for over the medium to long-term. So given that we are only half of the floor of that range right now, we will take the 21 basis points we have today is sustainable. Having said that, obviously, I don\u2019t think we are going to go from 20 to 40 in the quarter. But I do expect that as we go into 2016 and \u201817, we will probably see charge-offs start to move back up again into that range. I think one example to think about there to really bring it home is when you look at our C&I book. Today, we have got charge-offs in that book of less than 10 basis points, a single-digit basis points in a book where historically our average is more like 50 or 60. And so clearly in C&I, single-digit basis points won\u2019t be sustainable as the economy normalizes.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, John.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari", "Just back to the loan growth real quick on the C&I side and sorry if you touched on this, but just wanted to get a little bit more color behind the decline in the C&I balances end of periods of what drove it? And what would your outlook be for C&I in coming quarters given what you are seeing in the markets in the Southeast?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, that\u2019s sort of a quarter-to-quarter thing. I mean, we have had, in core areas, we have seen really good growth, healthcare, TMT, corporate banking, I mean, those numbers on an annualized basis are up 30 and plus kind of percent. So, we have got a lot of cylinders that are running at a high base. And then at others, we have just had some pay-downs. I mean, we have had sort of a significant level of pay-downs that have been maybe different than we have experienced in the past. And then as I said earlier, there is something that we just said on the margin that\u2019s just not really creating profitable value for us. So, we are just not going to play in that arena. So, I clearly think C&I will have positive growth. I mean, I think this is \u2013 it\u2019s a one quarter deal. Sort of over time, you have seen that. We have got 6% growth year-to-year based upon what I see with pipeline, based what I see in growth and unfunded commitments, based upon I see with new clients and all the things that are the health metrics of our business, I would expect C&I will continue to grow, but it will just be on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on sort of the same kind of example, we will look at each individual business within that and sort of make determinations. But I don\u2019t think we are in a flat environment in C&I growth maybe that\u2019s the best way to summarize that. We will grow over time.", "John Pancari", "Yes, that\u2019s helpful. The pay-downs is that \u2013 what parts of C&I are you seeing that more concentrated in?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, we have seen that in a couple of different areas. We have seen in our asset securitization area as a good example where we have had significant pay-downs. Clearly, on the CRE, we have seen significant pay-downs in that and most of those are positive. They are refinancing. There are companies that have moved to investment grade. So, they are paying down their loans. Their company is on the CRE side that they are moving out of the construction phase much faster. So, the quality of what we are doing is supporting it. So, it\u2019s not pay-downs that we are viewing is sort of a negative correlation, it\u2019s sort of positive. So, it\u2019s a number of different places.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then lastly just wanted to get color on the non-interest bearing deposit balance and again sorry, if you already touched on this, I missed a part of the call, but I know the non-interest bearing balances were down 3% linked quarter and year-over-year as well. So, just want to get some color on what drove that?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, I think that\u2019s just a reflection of client behavior and client needs. It looks like clients are looking for liquidity. They want daily liquidity. And as they grow balances in each of their accounts, we have had this history of client behavior over the last several years where in order to avoid fees on their accounts and manage their money better our clients are consolidating accounts and keeping more dollars in each of their accounts. And as they are doing that, they are starting to move into accounts that give them daily liquidity as well as the opportunity to earn something. So, I think that\u2019s just a reflection of client behavior.", "John Pancari", "Got it. Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.", "John McDonald", "Hi, good morning. Wondering if you could explain what drives the premium amortization income? What led to the decline this quarter, Aleem? And did you mention how much that contributed to the NIM expansion this quarter?", "Aleem Gillani", "John, I didn\u2019t mention it, but premium amortization this quarter declined by about $15 million and what drove that mostly was some remixing we did within our securities portfolio at the start of Q2 and that helped a little bit in Q2 and it helped more in Q3. At this kind of level, I would expect general stability in premium amortization. As I said, it improved by $15 million from Q2. Just so you have the number in your head, the actual amortization in Q3 was $45 million and I would expect as long as sort of rates are generally here to sit within that $40 million to $50 million range in amortization.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thanks. And then just a bigger picture follow-up, you guys have been executing really well. Your ROA the last nine months has been about 1%. You have got an ROTCE to about 12%, just under 12%. What are your longer term goals, Bill, in terms of where you think the ROA and ROTCE should be for this company as you think out of few years?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, we have been careful about not having a specific external goal, but clearly, I think over time, we are a north of 1% ROA company. That will actually be increasingly hard in the short-term. So, that\u2019s going to \u2013 the degree of difficulty actually is going to change in the short-term on that. But I think what you are seeing is that we have got the kind of company that\u2019s got the ability to be north of 1% ROA. And then on the ROTCE, similarly, I mean, I think sort of continue to sort of ratchet up as we think about where we need to be. Can you get back to those lofty numbers of 15%? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a lot of rate dependencies sort of pre-crisis dependencies on those. But I do think we have got we are going to continue to ratchet up even in this environment.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thanks.", "Aleem Gillani", "And John if I take sort of a longer term view of your question, if I think back pre-crisis, SunTrust was sort of averaging ROA of about 1.2%. So, I see no reason why over the long-term we can\u2019t be a 1.2% plus ROA company.", "John McDonald", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks. Wanted to ask you two questions, one is on the capital markets activities, you gave about $50 million, a little bit more than $50 million this quarter. I am just curious if all the uncertainty and disruptions in the marketplace if you didn\u2019t see some embedded activities or possible revenues as you move forward kind of stuck up in the pipelines out there in those businesses?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. There is clearly some of that, Marty. But let\u2019s keep in mind we are also year-to-year up 30%. And we had an unbelievably great second quarter. So part of the give up is we are just coming off a great second quarter. We had a lot of the things in the part of the business that are I would consider to be core like syndications held up well. M&A had another really good quarter and pipelines are still good there. The volatility numbers are in sort of high yield bonds and the equity sales and trading and that\u2019s better. Spreads have come in. I think things will get done more this quarter than they did last quarter if things stay stable. And based upon what I see in terms of our pipeline, I feel good about our pipeline. And I feel good about our pipeline again particularly in those sort of core areas. So what we saw in the decrease I saw was primarily related to specific volatility rather than any sort of chink in our strategy. And then as you highlighted it also creates opportunity and creates opportunity for a bank like ours.", "Marty Mosby", "Aleem, I have got a tougher question for you and the sense of\u2026", "Aleem Gillani", "Good, well, Marty why are saving the tough one for me.", "Marty Mosby", "When you look at the mortgage portfolio, you had to work hard with a lot of pain to allow for potential losses that were weighted to the big event that we had in the financial crisis and the unusual losses that we had in the portfolio. Now that we are on the backside of that and we have changed all the underwriting and now we are looking at a portfolio that\u2019s going to perform more like it did historically with very low losses expected for the foreseeable future without the risk of those big kind of spikes up, how do you think about allowing for that, because you are releasing reserves, but you had to put away a lot and should probably look at further benefits from that as you move forward?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, that is a great question actually Marty. If you would look at the mortgage segment slide that we have got in the deck, you do see we are actually releasing reserves. We have got a negative provision in that book this quarter. And as you look around the rest of the industry, you see I think kind of the same thing with the mortgage books and sort of home equity books generally looking better and better every quarter that we get away from the crisis with a lot of those reserves that have been set aside for those books starting to become apparently no longer required. And as that becomes more and more apparent over time, it\u2019s possible as you say, that we will continue to require fewer reserves for that book and you could see negative provisioning against that. However, against that if I think about the C&I book and my comments earlier about C&I charge-offs being at extremely low levels, I do expect that we will see increased charge-off and reserving required in C&I over time and to some extent that ought to offset the benefits that we are getting on the mortgage side.", "Marty Mosby", "Appreciate it. Just over time can be defined in different ways and been in periods where you had very low losses, especially in C&I books for not quarters but years and so you may not see the timing of that if you don\u2019t have event like energy to offset it going forward?", "Aleem Gillani", "Let\u2019s see, Marty if that happens. We will be happy.", "Marty Mosby", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matt O'Connor", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi, Matt.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, Matt.", "Matt O'Connor", "Bill, you have been talking about preferring to invest in SunTrust given the big opportunity organically versus doing deals, but I am wondering, with the combination of the improvement you have had on your expense base, ROA on the balance sheet optimization and then sort of macro factors out there in terms of both lower rates and likely slower growth for some time, is that thought process changing to where you may be more open to M&A and if not what needs to happen to be more a little more constructive on doing deals?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. I mean I think you have quoted me accurately, which I appreciated. And I still think the best opportunity is within SunTrust in terms of where I see the investment. And I still think we have significant opportunity for growth. And I also think we have efficiency opportunity. So I don\u2019t think we sort of run the string all the way out there that we are sort of looking for the next thing. All that being said, to the extent that we did get involved in anything it would be likely to be smaller fill in that would complement an existing line of the business or a product gap or something where we just saw we had a chance to enhance what we are doing rather than any large scale M&A.", "Matt O'Connor", "And would that apply just to key businesses or some openness in terms of geographic fill in bank deals as well?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. I mean if there was something interesting, I mean obviously on the geographic side, a lot of things that we would do, would dilute our franchise. And we want to make sure that we don\u2019t do anything geographically that dilutes the opportunities we see. I mean we have got states like Florida and North Carolina and Georgia, which are three of the top then job growth states in the country right now. So we are in a lot of the right places where we want to be for the next phase. So again, it could be I am not limiting that to fee business, but again if it were it would be fill in and not large scale at this point.", "Matt O'Connor", "Okay. Thank you.", "Ankur Vyas", "Angela, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Good morning guys.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning Gerard.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Aleem, can you come back to the C&I portfolio, you were saying that you are seeing some firming in pricing in the last month or two, can you give us some color where you are seeing that and what you think is causing it?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. Gerard I think what we are seeing there is that as you know over a long period of time, the loans that we have been putting on have been at lower yields than the loans that we have had that have been rolling off or paying down. And I think that that long-term several year consistent trend is starting to ease, partially because our overall portfolio yields are moving down. And so we are at a place now with the loans that are coming on are not as much lower in yield terms as they loans that are rolling off. So while there are still lower, I want to be clear about that, they are not as much lower and sort of that kind of firming is helping our overall portfolio. I think also we have been pretty explicit about trying to make sure that where we are not getting the returns that we expect to get, where we are being very careful about those relationships and managing our balance sheet as a precious resource. I think our teammates are very focused on that and so if we are not getting the returns we are sort of trying not to do that kind of business.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. I would say we wouldn\u2019t want to underplay or overplay that comment. It just is a \u2013 it\u2019s a reversal of a trend. So it\u2019s not as important to discuss that, that in this quarter, we saw some difference in that trend. I think as Aleem said, it\u2019s probably some combination of our own discipline and selection process at some combination of portfolio mix and probably some market issue, some widening bond spreads and sort of how do they reflect in terms of what we see in terms of production.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I think everybody in the call agrees with you about the outlook for credit, it\u2019s been great for you and the industry. And then question is on the C&I portfolio, Aleem you talked about I think the charge-offs now down to 10 basis points and over time you think they will go back up to a more normal number, 50 to 60. And the question is, is it so good today because of some ultraconservative underwriting standards you guys had 3 years or 4 years ago or \u2013 and then as we go into the future we head into a recession and that pushes it up, what\u2019s going to be the driver behind the normalization of credit losses?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, Gerard I don\u2019t know that our \u2013 I would characterize our underwriting standards as ultraconservative. I think we play in a market along with many other competitors and that market is what it is. However, I think that as a country, as an economy overall, we have all benefited from the increased liquidity that many corporations and increased capital that many corporations have placed within their companies and their portfolios. I think one of the other benefits also that you see for SunTrust and perhaps for the industry overall is the benefit of CCAR. The CCAR has changed the way that companies think about their overall risk. They apply a stress test to all their portfolios now and think about how portfolios would behave during a stress test. One of the benefits for SunTrust specifically is how good we look in CCAR. We are a top decile performer. We have managed our portfolio very carefully and that\u2019s what\u2019s helping our particular charge-off numbers right now look as good as they do.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you for this insight.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point. Now, I will turn the call over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "Good morning and welcome to SunTrust\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.", "With me today among other members of our executive management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, investors.suntrust.com. Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks, Ankur and good morning everybody. I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I will conclude with the review of our performance in 2015 as a whole in addition to providing some forward-looking perspectives.", "We delivered solid results this quarter, which is a direct result of the focus we have maintained on executing our primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing capital return to shareholders.", "For the fourth quarter, we reported $0.91 of earnings per share, which included $0.03 of discrete tax benefits. When adjusting for non-core items, earnings per share were stable compared with the prior quarter and prior year. Continued improvement in net interest income this quarter was offset by a decline in non-interest income as a result of challenging market conditions in addition to normal quarterly variability. Capital markets related income was in line with the prior quarter as the slowdown in fixed income markets was offset by higher equity origination fees and trading income, the latter, which was a result of increased client-driven interest rate hedging activities.", "Overall, we are successfully deepening client relationships within our wholesale banking platform and benefiting from our diverse business mix and breadth of capabilities. We achieved our goal of attaining the sub 63% efficiency ratio and ended the year with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 62.7%, 24 basis points better than 2014.", "Looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving our long-term goal of the being sub-60% and we will continue to diligently manage expenses while also investing in strategic revenue-generating initiatives throughout the company. We continue to see the benefits of our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts, which drove a 4 basis point improvement in our net interest margin and a $34 million increase in net interest income. This is further realization of a positive shift in our overall earning asset and funding mix.", "Average loans were up 2% compared to the third quarter driven by growth across most sectors, including commercial, consumer direct and residential mortgage. While loan growth will ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, we remain confident in our ability to generate growth in segments where returns are appropriate and we can have deeper relationships. However, we closely manage areas that don\u2019t meet those thresholds. Average deposits were also up 2%, which is further evidence of the success we are having in deepening client relationships across the company. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability, the latter of which is evidenced by the 35% reduction in long-term debt over the past year.", "Overall asset quality remains favorable. However, we did see an increase in non-performing loans as a result of deterioration in our energy-related exposure, which Aleem will provide details on later. Provision expense was less impacted as we have been building reserves in the previous quarters. The net charge-off ratio was 24 basis points, a strong result, but likely unsustainable long-term. Lastly, our capital position continues to be strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis.", "So, with that as a brief overview, I will turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the quarter\u2019s performance.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before I jump into the details, I would like to call your attention to a new table we are presenting on Slide 4, which highlights key metrics over the past five quarters and will help you analyze our financial performance in an efficient manner. As it is year end, we have added this slide to the main presentation and going forward, you will find this in the appendix.", "Moving to Slide 5, you can see the net interest margin improved by 4 basis points driven by higher security deals as a result of slower prepayment speeds, further low cost deposit growth and lower long-term debt as we received a full quarter benefit of the $1.7 billion debt reduction in the third quarter. Net interest income increased $34 million sequentially driven by solid 2% loan and deposit growth and the 4 basis point improvement in NIM. As a result of our activity balance sheet management efforts, overall net interest income has been grinding higher since the first quarter, which we had anticipated would be the trough. For the full year, net interest income declined at 2% entirely due to a decline in commercial loan swap income as a result of lower fixed rates. In 2016, commercial loan swap income will decline modestly relative to 2015 largely due to an anticipated increase in LIBOR, which would be more than offset by higher net interest income from the core asset sensitivity of the balance sheet.", "Looking ahead, we expect first quarter net interest margin to improve further 3 to 5 basis points relative to the fourth quarter. From there, NIM will likely be relatively stable for the remainder of 2016 assuming we only get one additional increase in the federal funds rate. We have been and will continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment while also ensuring our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates.", "Moving on to Slide 6, adjusted non-interest income declined $32 million sequentially primarily driven by asset disposition gains in the third quarter and lower wealth management-related revenue in the fourth quarter partially offset by an increase in mortgage related income. Wealth management-related revenue declined $13 million sequentially partially due to seasonal trust fees typically earned in the third quarter, but also due to market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity. Investment banking income declined $11 million as fixed income originations were negatively impacted by challenging market conditions. Equity originations and M&A however remained relatively strong, which is a reflection of the strategic capabilities that we have expanded over the past few years.", "Trading income increased $11 million driven by higher derivative marketing revenue as commercial clients increased their utilization of interest rate swaps to hedge potential changes in rates. Mortgage servicing income improved by $16 million due to higher servicing fees, some of which is seasonal, lower decay expense and better hedge performance. Mortgage production income declined $5 million as lower production was generally offset by improved channel mix.", "Service charges on deposits continue to steadily decline, a reflection of the increased transparency and technology we are providing our clients so they can manage their accounts more effectively. This decline will continue in 2016, in part driven by enhancements to our posting order process which once fully implemented will help our clients save more money and reduce our service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter. This transition will occur in the second half of 2016. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year non-interest income was down 4% driven by declines across most categories, largely due to the challenging market conditions experienced in the second half of 2015.", "Moving on to expenses on Slide 7, adjusted non-interest expense increased $35 million sequentially, almost entirely due to $32 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the previous quarter related to the successful resolution of previous mortgage matters. Outside processing and software costs were up $22 million due to higher utilization of certain third party services in addition to normal quarterly variability. Amortization expense increased by $8 million similar to last year\u2019s increase as we invested additional capital in low income communities which was generally offset by a correspondingly lower provision for income taxes. Offsetting these increases was a $35 million decline in personnel costs driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs as we calibrated expenses to actual performance. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2015 which is consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% driven by a combination of higher personnel expense and outside processing and software costs.", "For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 1% compared to 2014 and have declined each of the past four years. In fact adjusted expenses are down 15% since 2011, evidence of our efforts to operate more efficiently. Separately, while not a non-interest expense point, I will highlight that the discrete tax benefits we have recognized in 2015 resulted in an effective tax rate of 28% for the full year, which is below what we would consider a more normal range in the low-30s. As we look to the first quarter of this year we anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical seasonal increase of 401(k) and 5K expenses and also return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefit costs. In addition, our marketing and customer development costs will weigh more heavily in the first half of the year versus the second half as we are introducing a new campaign to further advance our purpose as a company. Bigger picture, after four consecutive years of declines, we expect 2016 expenses to be higher than 2015 as we expect revenues to improve. We will maintain our focus on the efficiency ratio and if revenue do not materialize we will have to adjust our expense base accordingly.", "As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.2% in the fourth quarter, up slightly over the prior quarter and year. Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.7%, better than our 2015 target and 24 basis points better than 2014. For 2016, we are targeting revenue growth that exceeds expense growth and thus a tangible efficiency ratio that improves. That being said, the pace of improvement will be significantly lower than previous years as our core expenses have already declined substantially and the operating environment while improving in certain areas remains challenging overall. Nonetheless, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60 %. And achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders.", "Turning to Slide 9, overall asset quality remains solid during the quarter evidenced by a 24 basis point net charge-off ratio and a 49 basis points NPL ratio. We did experience a deterioration in our energy portfolio, which when combined with the proactive NPL sales in prior quarters resulted in an NPL ratio that was 14 basis points higher sequentially, but very much in line with last year. As it relates to energy, not much has changed with regard to our exposure and mix. The energy portfolio is 2.2% of the total loan portfolio which is down 11% over the past year. The exploration and production and oil field services portfolios which are the most negatively impacted by prolonged low oil prices represent a little under 40% of the total energy portfolio or slightly under 1% of total loans.", "Our reserves for the energy portfolio are approximately 4.5% and when isolated to the two most severely impacted sectors are near 12%. In addition, total reserves of $1.8 billion have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio. Losses in the E&P and oil field services portfolios will be elevated over the next couple of years and will thus cause overall C&I loss rates to rise from their low levels today. However, given all of the factors I mentioned we believe our energy related risk remains very manageable in the context of the overall company. The provision for credit losses increased $19 million sequentially and the ALLL ratio declined 5 basis points to 1.29% consistent with overall credit quality trends.", "Looking ahead, we expect non-performing loans and net charge-offs to increase, primarily as a result of further stress on the energy portfolio. Despite this we would still expect the company\u2019s overall net charge-off rate to be less than 40 basis points in 2016. Provision expense this year will more closely match net charge-offs as the multi-year improvement in asset quality abates. Ultimately our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process which is informed by trends in all of our loan portfolios combined with the view on economic conditions.", "Let\u2019s turn to balance sheet trends, average performing loans were up 2% sequentially driven by continued momentum in our commercial and consumer portfolios in addition to lower levels of pay-offs. Commercial loan growth was broad based and driven by corporate, commercial auto dealer and commercial real estate clients. While consumer loan growth was driven by growth in direct, indirect and guaranteed student loans. The momentum in the consumer direct portfolio continues to be strong, driven by LightStream\u2019s, our partnership with GreenSky and further success with our credit card offering. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2 billion or 2% driven by 3% growth in C&I and 13% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines in home equity, pay-offs in commercial real estate and reductions in indirect consumer loans given our focus on returns. In total, we have proactively sold or securitized approximately $5 billion of loans since the middle of 2014. Going forward, we will periodically sell or securitize lower return loans as part of our balance sheet optimization focus, though likely not at the pace of the past 18 months.", "Turning to deposits on Slide 11, average client deposits were up $2.9 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 8% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We are pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients\u2019 deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale sectors. In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within wholesale banking continue to do an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill referenced earlier our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher cost long-term debt by $4.5 billion or 35% in just the past year. Importantly, the strong growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low cost deposit growth continues to be strong while higher cost deposits have been gradually declining. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will reverse. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.", "Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. Our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was up 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was stable sequentially and up 6% compared to the prior year driven by growth in retained earnings partially offset by lower AOCIs as a result of higher interest rates.", "For our 2015 capital plan, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the fourth quarter. In addition, we repurchased an incremental $39 million of common stock in December, which reflects our overall commitment to increase capital return to shareholders. We expect to repurchase approximately $350 million of additional common stock in the first half of 2016 to complete our 2015 capital plan. As a result of our capital return program, we are continuing to drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Lastly, as of January 1, the liquidity coverage ratio is now a formal requirement. We have started the year in full compliance and we will of course maintain that status over the course of 2016.", "Moving to the segment overviews, we will begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on Slide 13. Net income declined 6% sequentially as elevated market volatility resulted in lower wealth management-related revenue. We also had a modest increase in expenses driven in part by investments in our card offerings as well as various one-time items. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 4% annually benefiting from continued low cost deposit growth and our balance sheet optimization efforts. The strong growth in our consumer direct portfolios has afforded us the opportunity to sell, securitize or reduce production in lower return areas. Deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% for the full year, with much of this growth coming from deeper relationships with our mass affluent client base aided by our investments in premier bankers and the SummitView platform.", "On a full year basis, CPWM posted strong net income growth of 8%, which is once again the result of strong deposit growth, our balance sheet optimization efforts and further improvements in credit quality. Loan balances declined 3% in 2015 as we sold or securitized approximately $2 billion of loans. But organic consumer loan production was solid and increased 5%.", "Non-interest income declined 1% for the full year largely due to the headwinds wealth management faced in 2015, but also due to the continued decline in service charges. While current market conditions have made growing wealth management revenue more challenging, meeting more of our clients\u2019 wealth and investment needs continues to be a strategic priority for our company.", "Expenses in CPWM have been well-controlled as we have been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing talent and technology. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments and expect this to increase as mobile adoption rates and digital sales trend upwards. Bigger picture, the progress we have made in optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. We are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business both as it executes against its strategic priorities and as the value of our strong deposit franchise is more fully realized in a normal interest rate environment.", "Moving to wholesale banking on Slide 14, we had a solid quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions. Revenues were down 3% sequentially, but stable relative to the prior year. Much of the decline in revenue was driven by overall market volatility, which not only impacted debt origination activity, but also resulted in adverse mark-to-market impacts. Partially mitigating these impacts was strength in other product areas, such as equity originations, equity sales and trading and derivatives marketing, a reflection of the increasing diversity of our business model.", "Net interest income was up 1% sequentially as a result of strong loan and deposit growth partially offset by margin compression. Overall, net income declined 9% sequentially as a result of the declines in non-interest income and increased provision expense. While we have been building reserves for our energy exposure since the fourth quarter of 2014, the prolonged low oil price environment will continue to place pressure on the provision expense in this business.", "On a full year basis, we saw strong performance with a record year for wholesale bank, demonstrated by the 9% increase in net income driven by broad-based revenue growth partially offset by energy-related reserve increases. Net interest income was up 6%, driven by 8% loan growth and 16% deposit growth. The loan growth was broad-based across each line of business and most industry verticals partially offset by intentional reductions in lower return areas. The deposit momentum within this business also continues to be strong, evidence of the success our liquidity specialists within wholesale are having and the enhancements we have made to our treasury and payment product offerings.", "Non-interest income was up 10% in part due to the 14% growth in investment banking income, where we had record years in equity originations, M&A, syndicated and leveraged finance and investment grade bond originations. The breadth of growth here is reflective of the investments we have made to expand our capabilities and thus become more of a strategic advisor to all of our wholesale clients. The tangible efficiency ratio improved further to 48.6% as we drove further operating leverage while also investing in revenue-generating initiatives.", "In conclusion, while market conditions can be choppy quarter-to-quarter, we are encouraged by our differentiated business model within wholesale banking and are confident in the opportunities we have to expand our client base, meet more of their complex corporate finance and advisory needs and continue to grow our business.", "Moving to the mortgage segment, revenues were stable sequentially as higher servicing income helped to offset the decline in production income. Net income declined $38 million as a result of the $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined by $22 million as a result of lower margins both in production and our held-for-investment loan portfolio. These declines were partially offset by an increase in servicing income as a result of portfolio acquisitions over the past couple of years.", "For the full year, we saw $137 million increase in adjusted net income, which is primarily due to the significantly improved credit quality of the loan portfolio both as a result of the improving housing market and our proactive actions to de-risk the book. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in net interest income as a result of $2.3 billion of loan sales in 2014 and lower loan spreads in 2015.", "Production volume increased by 38% in 2015, due primarily to higher refinancing activity, new purchase volume also improved in 2015, a broader sign of the continued improvement of the economies in our markets. We also grew the servicing portfolio by 5% as a result of portfolio acquisitions. In both production and servicing, we achieved our objectives of smart, targeted market share growth. I would also like to point out that we successfully switched to a new loan origination system in the second half of 2015, which facilitates a faster and simpler loan process for our clients and teammates, but also allowed us to more efficiently meet the new TRID requirements, which became effective October 1. This was a significant and important undertaking and we have already been able to use our success as a competitive advantage to attract new talent in several of our markets. Overall, the mortgage business continues to benefit from improving asset quality and good expense discipline, both of which have allowed this business to become a more steady contributor to the bottom line performance of this company.", "And with that, I will turn it back over to Bill to share some concluding perspectives on our performance in 2015 and our outlook for 2016.", "Bill Rogers", "Great. Thanks Aleem. So coming into last year, we have several key objectives; continue to improve efficiency, further optimize the balance sheet in order to enhance returns, invest in growth opportunities and increase capital return. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in 2015 as we met each of these objectives. We grew earnings per share by a solid 11%, we met our efficiency ratio goal, we increased ROA by 5 basis points and advanced the revenue growth trajectory of many businesses, all in the context of managing the headwinds associated with the prolonged low interest rate environment. We also grew tangible book value per share by 6% and returned over 60% of our earnings back to our shareholders, continuing our path of improving capital returns.", "Our performance is a reflection of the diversity of our business model, where each segment made strong contributions to enhance the financial performance of our company. Within consumer and private wealth, organic production growth and higher return portfolios and continued momentum on the deposit front has allowed us to further optimize the balance sheet. Our investments in digital have allowed us to better identify and meet more client needs while also extracting efficiencies from certain areas. In wholesale, our differentiated business model allowed us to absorb the impact of the more challenging market conditions in the second half of the year and drive strong high single-digit growth in revenue and net income. In particular, I am pleased with the more integrated One Team approach we delivered to our clients and that\u2019s evidenced by a 36% increase in capital markets revenue from the commercial real estate and private wealth businesses. This increase in client and product diversity will be an important contributor to the long-term growth of wholesale banking. And within mortgage, we benefited from the abatement of legacy mortgage related costs, but also from the targeted growth initiatives we have in place to grow production in servicing. The transition to a new origination platform was time-consuming and challenging, but I believe we have the right risk and operational foundation to place to further advance our mortgage business.", "So as we look into 2016, we will remain focused on the same primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency, all with the goal of creating further value for our clients and shareholders. While the revenue environment is expected to improve, we expect credit cards will normalize in the non-recurring benefits we had in 2015 will abate. Subsequently, we will need to deliver positive operating leverage in 2016 in order to achieve our financial objectives and make further progress towards our long-term target of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. So to conclude, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank all of our teammates for their key roles in delivering our 2015 financial results, many of them are on the phone today. Our team is diligently focused on fulfilling our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients, communities and shareholders. As we look into 2016, we will further advance this purpose, facilitating a dialogue about money in order to help Americans move from financial stress to control and ultimately to confidence. Our team is absolutely ready to go.", "Now with that, I will turn it back over to Ankur and we will begin the Q&A portion.", "Ankur Vyas", "Dexter, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I would like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "I was wondering if you can give us some thoughts on your framework in terms of when all said and done, how you think the energy book plays out in terms of either default rates or total NPL levels, what the loss content might be and any framework on that kind of would be helpful?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, Matt, let me take a crack at that. I think when you think about our energy book overall, it\u2019s helpful to think about the context. So you know our energy exposure overall is only 2.2% of our total loan book, first of all. Secondly, within that E&P and oil field services are 40%, so only about 1% of our total loan portfolio is in those two sectors which should probably be the sectors most negatively impacted by lower oil prices. Within that, now you think about, we have got about 4.5% of reserves against the entire energy book. So for those two segments, reserve levels are closer to 12%. So that starts to feel pretty good. And then thirdly, of course we have got total of $1.8 billion of ALLL in total, which is available to cover all of our loans. So as I think about what might happen here in 2016, \u201817, \u201818, we will see some increase in NPLs. We will see some increase in provisioning against our energy portfolio. But in the context of the rest of the book, where our resi mortgage exposure continues to get better and better and as charge-off levels and required reserves continue to come down, I think that our 2016 charge-off levels and provision levels for energy actually are looking very manageable.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "And then, just on the loss content, once the loan is moved to non-performer, can you remind us, do you take a charge-off on that and then what\u2019s potentially the eventual loss content, obviously not all non-performers are the same, but it takes a while for that to be clear, I think from the outside?", "Bill Rogers", "It does. I mean, it will take a while to see how all of this plays out. We build \u2013 we are building up our reserves for energy clients, up client-by-client. You actually made a great point in not all non-performers have the same loss content. You saw the increase in non-performing loans that we had this quarter. I ought to let you know that the vast majority of those non-performing loans are actually performing, they are still performing today. What we are trying to do here is be prudent and get ahead of the curve on non-performing loans the same way you saw us do in Q4 \u201814 when we tried to get ahead of the curve and start to provision early for energy. We are trying to do the same thing here in non-performing loans.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "John McDonald", "Yes. Hi, just following-up on credit again, the outlook for net charge-offs less than 40 basis points is a bit away from the 24 basis points you did this quarter, recognizing that\u2019s a very low charge-off rate that you are at today, are you expecting it to kind of march up steadily? And is it the driver of your outlook for higher charge-offs really just energy or you have got some other normalization going on?", "Bill Rogers", "No, it\u2019s mostly just energy as sort of where I think the inflection is, John. We have been seeing now for several years that our charge-off levels are unsustainably low. Well, it looks like energy might be the catalyst to actually turn that around. So, I do expect that we will see more provisioning coming in the wholesale book in 2016, but I also expect the rise in provisioning will be mitigated by the releases that I expect to get out of our consumer and mortgage books in that as a result of resi mortgage improving.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. And outside of energy that increase was more of a macro combat. I mean to your question, we don\u2019t see any particular portfolio segment, geography however you might want to categorize it that we see a particular problem and it\u2019s more of a macro kind of non-energy compound.", "John McDonald", "Okay. So, you still could have some net reserve release in the beginning part of the year, Aleem. It sounds like the gap is going to close between provision and charge-offs, but you could still have a little bit of a gap?", "Bill Rogers", "Maybe, I am not sure yet, John. But if I think about the full year, I would think that our full year provision and charge-offs ought to be pretty close.", "John McDonald", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, thanks. Two questions. Just one more on the energy reserve and one on loan growth, on the energy reserve, you indicated the 4.5% and the 12%. Can you give us a sense as to how you think about oil price when you are making that reserve? Is that done on a forward basis, on a spot basis? And can you give us some sensitivities to, if oil goes down another $5 or another $10, what happens to the reserve there?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, the reserve is built as of December 31, Betsy. So at the time we used the oil price on that day, which was $37. That\u2019s the way the reserve was built. If oil stays down under $30 for a while, yes, we will expect that we will continue to see additional provisioning required. But as I said earlier, I think we will be able to mitigate some of that with the benefits we get out of the mortgage book overall. Our price decks as you know are pretty sort of consistent across the industry and we will be rebuilding our new price deck for the spring re-determination period very soon.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, no sense of just what kind of order of magnitude change we should expect or like should I just take whatever the reserve is that you have done today than have another half or given an expectation for if oil stays at $30?", "Bill Rogers", "I don\u2019t have a great sense of that for you yet, but it will be well into eight figures, maybe even get into nine figures in total provisioning over a multiyear period, which in the context of the total PPNR for the company and releases will be coming out of mortgage, I think they are very manageable.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And just the follow-up was on loan growth and C&I had a nice inflection this quarter, maybe you can speak to the drivers there, was that just less asset sales or more of originations, context would be great?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, it\u2019s interesting, because we have sort of talked about loan growth being an outcome versus something that we are managing. And if I look at production over the last few quarters, it\u2019s actually been very consistent and at a consistent high level. In the fourth quarter, in particular, we benefit a little more from some lower pay-downs, so pay-downs were a little less in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. We had a slight increase in the utilization rate. I don\u2019t want to mark anything there, but there was a slight increase in the utilization rate. So, it really is just a \u2013 it\u2019s a reflection of all the things we have been doing within the case of the fourth quarter, just a little less headwind than we have had in the previous quarters.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Ken Usdin", "Hi, good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, Ken.", "Ken Usdin", "Good morning. I just want to level set on the starting points for the expense side, I got your point about the step up the annuals, the quarterly step up and then the marketing in the first half and taking your points about driving to operating leverage. It seems like we had a great end to the year and we have that normal step-up. So \u2013 and I know we ask this question a lot, but can you just help us frame kind of the starting point and then I presume we kind of still have that ramp down throughout the year. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, that would be a nice way to think about it, but of course, it depends on the revenue environment. If the revenue environment improves in \u201816 relative to \u201815 as we are currently anticipating, I think that will be the driver of expenses increasing \u201816 relative to \u201815. If I try to think about, Ken, an average number and of course, it\u2019s going \u2013 this is going to be volatile quarter-to-quarter. But if I try to think about an average number for the year, I would probably be thinking about something that would be closer to something like $1.35 billion on average, some quarters higher, some quarters lower and improving slightly, improving efficiency ratio as that revenue appears. If the revenue environment does not improve, then we will have to adjust expenses accordingly. And in that case, I would start thinking about a number lower than that, maybe closer to the $1.3 billion.", "Ken Usdin", "Yes, understood. And then just a follow-up on that is you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years rightsizing shrinking branch count, etcetera, how much flexibility would you have in that tougher environment? We don\u2019t want to anticipate happening, but like is there a lot of opportunity set still inside if that were to be the case?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, this is Bill. I mean, I think the opportunity still exist, because we are still on the path to sub-60. So, we have plans underway for expense management in virtually every category. So, it\u2019s not like they are not on the shelf already, our ability to execute against them would really mean. In fact, we are taking a little more risk speeding them up in terms of terms [ph]. So, we have those plans in mind.", "Aleem Gillani", "Ken, you may have seen the press announcement we had in the last few days about changes in our real estate footprint in Raleigh and in Richmond, we are moving to new space. We will take our total number of locations in those two cities from 11 to 5 between \u201816 and \u201817. We will reduce our square footage in those areas by 50% and we will create a better environment for our teammates. Just as a sort of a point of info, we have been \u2013 you said, we have been working on branch count and office space reduction over the last several years. We have actually taken out 2.5 million square feet over the last 4 years out of our physical footprint and we continue to be on that path. Between now and 2018, we will stay on that becoming more efficient with our use of space.", "Bill Rogers", "So to answer your question, I mean, we think we have got the flexibility on the expense versus revenue achieved in the efficiency ratio target long-term. It doesn\u2019t exactly work perfectly quarter-to-quarter. I mean, that\u2019s the point that I would want to make. But we can look ahead and adjust the levers accordingly.", "Ken Usdin", "Understood. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "Maybe I could just follow-up on Ken\u2019s question, if we were to have expenses coming in at $1.35 billion you are going to imply something like mid single-digit growth. And Aleem, given your comments around positive operating leverage, that implies revenue growth should be north of 5%. I was just wondering maybe can you talk us through the components of revenue growth? How should we think about NII growth? What does it mean for the net interest margin over the last couple of quarters? And on the fee side, how do we think about the split between wholesale and consumer fees? Clearly, consumer will likely be under pressure as you make some changes. Markets have come down. So, may be that will hurt the wealth business, but just trying to contextualize how to think about the different moving pieces on revenue growth?", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks Ryan for the question. So, if you think about NII overall, for the last several years, it\u2019s been essentially flat, maybe even coming down a small amount and that\u2019s been the effect of declining NIMs essentially being offset by production and growth. Now that NIMs are no longer declining and we are looking for NIM to be essentially stable for 2016, that underlines our organic loan production and growth on both assets and liabilities is going to start to show through. And as that shows through, I think we will see NII start to climb in \u201916, sort of as it started to do in \u201815 after the first quarter. So I think that will be where you see the growth in revenue. On the fee income side, you are right, we are not really expecting growth in consumer service charges, that\u2019s not going to be a growth area for us, but the growth that we have seen overall in wholesale will continue, I think will continue to appear. The One Team approach that we have got, our ability to meet more of our clients\u2019 needs across more products and be a bigger, more of a strategic advisor to more clients, I think continues to show up. So I think that will be helpful. And I think mortgage will also become a more sort of consistent contributor to the bottom line. So that\u2019s where revenue will appear.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. And then maybe if I could just follow-up on one other question, given where your reserve is on energy and the E&P and oil field services book of 12% and which I think is well above a lot of your peers, I guess how should we think about the comment that you made that we should expect continued reserve builds from here. And more specifically, if oil prices stayed at these levels, what would be realistic loss content over a 2-year period, I heard what you said to Betsy, but I am just trying to understand like why would losses in your book be at that type of level relative to peers you were talking about levels that are half of what you are commenting on?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, you know us, we are inherently a conservative company and we would try to think conservatively. So I don\u2019t know where peers are or what they have got in their book. We are trying to be careful and make sure that we stay ahead of this overall. I think our reserve levels are very prudent for where we are right now with oil at this stage in the cycle. But remember, we set these reserves when oil was $37. And if oil moves into the $20s, we will have to take account of that and I would think that the farther oil moves down, the loss content starts to become asymmetric for the industry.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Your line is now open.", "Mike Mayo", "Hi. Well, can\u2019t wait for the Super Bowl to see your ad.", "Bill Rogers", "Great.", "Mike Mayo", "But it comes in the context of 4 years of expense declines and now expense is going higher as you just discussed. So it\u2019s the same question I asked last year and you got your target. But if we don\u2019t get rate increases, do you think you can still grow revenues faster than expenses and you gave some specific examples about those locations. But if you could say, what are the few main reasons why you think you can improve efficiency if that is the case without rate hikes?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. I think Mike, as we went into last year we were a very clear about saying we were going to improve efficiency irrespective of rates. So we sort of said take that off the table. Now it looks like we are only projecting two rate hikes and one at end of the year. So I think we are still taking a pretty conservative approach to the impact of rate hikes. And we are continuing to make the statement that we are going to stay focused on improving our efficiency ratio. Now in fairness, it grinds down slower. So there is no doubt about that. I mean we got sort of a big junk and it grinds down slower. But we are not backing off, we are not wavering or anything I guess the commitment to continue to improve on the efficiency side.", "Aleem Gillani", "Mike, in terms of some of the things that we continued to work on expenses, to be clear, we are not saying that we are taking our foot off the gas pedal on managing expenses. And we are still looking at overall operations costs. We are looking at call centers, lending centers. We are still looking at technology infrastructure and how we can continue to improve our efficiency there. I mentioned that we introduced a new mortgage origination platform late in 2015 and I anticipate that, that will help our overall efficiency and effectiveness within the mortgage segment. I mentioned we continue to work on optimizing our real estate footprint and we will continue to do that now through \u201818 and \u201819, I expect. And look, across the whole company, we are staying disciplined on how we manage roles, responsibilities. We have a very clear pay for performance philosophy. I think that shows up for \u2013 across our teammate profile. And of course we continue to consolidate our suppliers. So we are working on managing our third party supplier profile. So none of this is meant to say that, hey we are declaring victory on expenses, what we are saying is that as we move forward the big rocks on expenses, I think we have achieved and we are going to be more balanced to going forward in terms of revenue growth and expense management.", "Mike Mayo", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks. Aleem, I want to ask you on your guidance on net interest margin being I think a little inconsistent, so I just want to make sure we connect the dots right, you came into the year in first quarter of \u201815, you had a 2.83 margin, which improved to 2.98 by the time you get to the end of the year, which would average 2.90, you are saying you are going to improve 3 basis points to 5 basis points in the first quarter. And so when you are looking at that kind of trend, your net interest margin would have to significantly be above in 2016 versus 2015 unless expense going downward from the first quarter through the end of 2016?", "Aleem Gillani", "That\u2019s right Marty, that\u2019s exactly what I was trying to say. I am sorry, if I was unclear. I do expect...", "Marty Mosby", "Just a little more flat year-to-year, which you really got a \u2013 already a lot of improvement in there and I was also wondering about you said if you had another rate hike in the middle of the year, if you wouldn\u2019t see the margin improve over the first quarter, when you are already getting some benefit from rising interest rates, there would be seems like another catalyst or margins to go up again on that next, just one more rate hike in the middle of the year?", "Aleem Gillani", "I do think that will help. So to be clear on my margin expectations, Marty I think the first quarter margin will go up from the fourth quarter. And I think that\u2019s sort of 3 basis points to 5 basis points or so. And then from there for the rest of the year, I am expecting it to be generally stable to the first quarter number, to the increased higher margin level, assuming we get that one rate hike in the middle of the year. The offset to that, so that\u2019s \u2013 the rate hike is going to be helpful and we are asset sensitive. And we are asset sensitive actually at every key rate duration point across the curve. So that will be helpful. The offset to that is competitive pressures are still strong. Spreads continue to be tight, if anything grinding maybe at a bit tighter, but sort of trying to stabilizing a little bit relative to the decline we saw in spreads over the last year. And we still have old mortgages and old securities that will continue to roll off the books that will have to reinvest that new lower rates. So there are mitigants to the rate rise, which I think will put a cap on margin. But I do think year-over-year, margin will be higher and Q1 to Q4 margin will be higher.", "Marty Mosby", "And then as a follow-up on the asset quality side, you are talking about being conservative in a sense that you got performing loans that somehow you are pushing into non-performing, I didn\u2019t really have any foreshadowing of this in the delinquencies, can you give us some feel for the migration of how $200 million ended up in non-performing this particular quarter and your thought process around that deterioration? Thank you.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. Thanks for the question, Marty. We are just trying to be a little bit careful here. The majority of the loans we put into non-performing are actually still performing today. They are performing loans, but these are loans when we look at those particular clients, we think that there is a risk that they will become non-performing some time in the next couple of years if oil stays where it is. Remember how quickly this move has been on oil, right. And so it\u2019s only 15 months ago, we were at $100 a barrel. So, the move has been very, very rapid and we are just trying to make sure that we try and stay ahead of this, so that we don\u2019t end up surprising you and ourselves later.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks.", "Ankur Vyas", "Dexter, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. Our last question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.", "John Pancari", "Good morning.", "Bill Rogers", "Good morning, John.", "John Pancari", "Going back to energy, sorry, the \u2013 regarding the increase in the NPAs, can you just tell us what types of credits they were or the E&P or service that went on to NPA? Also were they shared national credits and do you have the average size of the credits that moved on or the number?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, it was just a handful of credits, John. I don\u2019t know if they were shared national credits, but it was a relatively small number and they were all either upstream or services.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And again, the increase in the charge-offs this quarter that was related to the energy book as well?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, some of it was. There was one charge-off in energy that related to one credit.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then the non-energy or the non-oilfield service and non-E&P types of loans that you are including in that energy-related classification, what is that? Is that utilities and coal?", "Bill Rogers", "That\u2019s mostly midstream and downstream. So, when you look at midstream and downstream that makes up the remainder of what we call the energy book. And when you think about what lower oil prices do for midstream, it\u2019s sort of a nonevent and for downstream, it\u2019s actually beneficial. And so for our downstream clients, the decrease in energy prices will help them.", "John Pancari", "Okay, alright. And then lastly also within the energy topic, do you have your total criticized ratio within your energy portfolio? And then also how much of your energy book is investment grade versus non-investment grade?", "Bill Rogers", "Well, John, let me answer those backwards. The investment grade versus non-investment grade, I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me, but as you would expect, we have a relatively higher proportion than others of investment grade, so think about the context maybe of a third to a half of our book would actually be investment grade. And as you would also expect when you think about a conservative underwriter like SunTrust, the criticized portion would be relatively low and for us that\u2019s on the order of 20%.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then lastly, the first lien versus second lien, do you have that?", "Bill Rogers", "The vast majority of our loans are first lien. The vast, vast majority of our loans are first lien.", "John Pancari", "Okay. Alright, great. Thank you.", "Ankur Vyas", "Operator, this concludes our call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today.

Good morning and welcome to SunTrust\u2019s First quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call.

I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I\u2019ll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter\u2019s performance fits into our long-term strategy and investment thesis.", "This quarter we saw the benefits of our consistent strategic focus and improving execution, a combination of which resulted in revenue growth that exceeded expense growth. As we communicated during the last earnings call, delivering positive operating leverage in 2016 was going to be necessary to overcome our expectation of our credit cost and to achieve our financial objectives. Our performance in the first quarter was a good start towards meeting those objectives for the year.", "Specifically, we reported $0.84 per share slightly lower than the fourth quarter given typical seasonal patterns in our business and more importantly up a solid 8% compared to a year ago. Total revenue was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The sequential improvement was driven by an increase in net interest income and non-interest income where we benefitted from good performance across both, mortgage and capital markets, a lot of which was notable given market conditions in January and February. Out net interest margin improved 6 basis points sequentially and is up 21 basis points over the past year, reflecting our continued efforts to optimize the balance sheet, including improving our loan mix, growing deposits and reducing long-term debt all while carefully managing duration.", "Despite a modest increase in our expense base, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.3%, a full 220 basis points better than last year and represents the focus we have maintained on disciplined expense management, which has also created additional capacity to invest in our franchise. Average loans were up 2% sequentially driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. While loan growth will not likely sustain at this rate, I would characterize the overall economy and client activity levels as healthy and we will remain focused on generating growth where returns are appropriate and we can create deeper client relationships.", "Average deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year with broad-based growth across our consumer private wealth and wholesale businesses. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. Asset quality excluding energy remained strong as evidenced by a 25 basis point net charge-off ratio. However, the low oil price environment continues to pressure our energy clients, which contributed to the increase in non-performing loans, our reserves and provision expenses. We remain focused on being proactive around energy and therefore have increased the resources and intensity around mitigating our risk and helping our clients navigate through this downturn. However, we continue to view this risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company.", "Our capital position was stable with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 5% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Our strong capital position combined with the cumulative actions we\u2019ve taken to improve our risk and earnings profile should help us further increase capital returns to shareholders. Our 2016 capital plan is now under review and we\u2019ll have more to report on that outcome in late June. So with that as a quick overview, let me turn over to Aleem to provide some more details on the quarter\u2019s performance.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Moving to Slide 4, you can see that our net interest margin improved 6 basis points. Primarily driven by higher loan yields as a result of the recent increase in short-term rates, and partially offset by slightly higher funding costs. Net interest income increased 3% sequentially driven by the 6 basis point improvement in NIM and solid 2% loan growth. On a year-over-year basis, net interest margin increased 21 basis points due to the same factors as the sequential drivers, but also due to our continuous balance sheet management and optimization efforts. These efforts have resulted in a favorable shift in our loan portfolio mix, a significant reduction in higher cost long-term debt driven by low cost deposit growth, and lower premium amortization expense in our securities portfolio.", "Looking ahead to the remainder of 2016 and assuming there are no additional increases in the Fed funds rate. We expect net interest margin to decline by an average of a couple of basis points per quarter. If there are increases in the Fed funds rate, we would expect our net interest margin to benefit, given our modestly asset sensitive position with the amount of benefit dependant on the shape of the yield curve in addition to the broader competitive environment. We have been and we\u2019ll continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment. While also ensuring our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates.", "Moving to Slide 5, non-interest income increased $16 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage-related income resulting from a recent increase in refinancing activity. Capital markets related income was up modestly, a performance that was better than anticipated due to a strong March, but also as a result of our continued long-term investments and market share gains in CIB.", "Wealth management related revenue declined $6 million sequentially due to challenging market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity. Service charges on deposits were relatively flat from both the prior quarter and prior year. As a reminder, those will decline when we enhance our posting order process, which will reduce service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter beginning in Q4. And as Bill referenced earlier, the combination of the trends you saw on Slide 4 and Slide 5 resulted in total revenues that was up 3% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.", "Let\u2019s move onto expenses. Non-interest expense increased $30 million relative to the prior quarter, driven entirely by an $84 million increase in personnel expenses as a result of the typical seasonal increases in FICA, incentives and 401(k) costs. Partially offsetting this increase, were lower outside processing and software costs and legal and consulting expense, partially due to the normal quarterly variability. In comparison to the first quarter of last year, non-interest expense was up 3% largely due to higher marketing expenses, in addition to continued and targeted investments in our businesses.", "Separately, well our FDIC premium expense has been declining modestly over the past two years as our risk profile has improved, beginning in the third quarter this expense category will increase by approximately $10 million per quarter, given the FDIC\u2019s recently announced surcharge on large depository institutions. This incremental surcharge is anticipated to be effective for approximately 10 quarters.", "As you can see on Slide 7, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.3% in the first quarter, an improvement of 220 basis points year-over-year. As revenue growth exceeded expense growth, which was our goal coming into the year. Our first quarter progress while early puts us on pace to meet our objective of improving our efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year and more importantly demonstrates our intense focus on strong expense disciplines and our long-term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio.", "Turning to Slide 8, overall asset quality remained strong during the quarter, as evidenced by net charge-offs and non-performing loans excluding the impact of energy that are down 28% and 9% respectively year-over-year. However, as anticipated the NPL ratio increased due to deterioration in the energy portfolio, which when combined with loan growth resulted in an $18 million increase in the total allowance for loan and lease losses. With respect to the energy portfolio, we\u2019ve provided some additional detail on this slide and more information on Slide 18 in the appendix. The energy portfolio remained stable at 2% of loans, with the compositions also very similar to the prior quarter. Of note, E&P and oilfield services, the two sectors most impacted by lower oil prices represent only 38% of total energy loans, a mix we believe is favorable relative to the industry.", "In addition, we migrated an additional $250 million of energy loans to non-performing status, and also increased our criticized accruing balances by $150 million. The net of which brings our criticized ratio to 29% up from 19% in the prior quarter. Approximately 90% of this quarter\u2019s migration was concentrated in the E&P sector, where collateral coverage remains healthy despite reserve based evaluations, and importantly the vast majority of these loans were still current as of March 31st. This migration and our allowance includes the effect of our internal risk review, in addition to the results of the recent Shared National Credit exam.", "Our energy related provision expense in the quarter was approximately $30 million, half of which covered charge-off and half of which was a reserve build, resulting in a 4.6% reserve ratio for total energy loans outstanding. Our total energy reserves as a percentage of E&P and oilfield services are roughly 12% which we believe is a more relevant measure that is responsive to portfolio mix. As a reminder, our total reserves of 1.8 billion which have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio represent approximately 2 times our non-performers and 3.5 times the mid-point of our 30 to 40 basis point net charge-off range for 2016. Big picture, while we have increased the resources and intensity around managing our exposure, we continue to view our energy related risk as very manageable in the context of the overall company.", "From here, assuming all prices do not decline significantly we would expect energy related NPLs formation to moderate. As we have already taken significant action over the past few quarters. We continue to expect the Company\u2019s overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full year 2016. We also expect our ALLL to loans ratio to be relatively stable, which when combined with our expectation for loan growth should result in a total provision expense in 2016 that exceeds net charge-offs. With regard to both charge-offs and provision expenses, these are full year expectations and there maybe some quarterly variability given the uncertainty of when certain credits will be resolved and the results of our rigorous allowance process.", "Let\u2019s turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial real-estate clients while consumer loan growth was generally broad-based. Our consumer direct strategy continues to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels. On a year-over-year basis average performing loans grew $4.9 billion or 4%, driven by 5% growth in C&I and 20% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines at home equity, pay-offs in commercial real-estate and a smaller indirect portfolio following our $1 billion indirect auto securitizations last June.", "Turning to deposits, average client deposits increased 1%, compared to the prior quarter and 6% year-over-year with growth across most products and businesses. Our successful deposit growth strategy is the result of our commitment to meeting more of our clients deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms, and ultimately our teammates across all three business segments. Rates paid on deposits increased 2 basis points sequentially given the increase in short-term rates. If interest rates rise further trend will continue. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.", "Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. We\u2019ve added approximately $700 million of common equity Tier 1 over the past year and held our estimated Basel III CET1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis at 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was up 5% sequentially and up 9% compared to the prior year, driven by growth and retained earnings and higher AOCI, as a result of lower long-term interest rates. In addition, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds regulatory requirements.", "This quarter, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and common stock warrants and paid a $0.24 dividend. We will repurchase an additional $175 million of common stock during the second quarter to complete our 2015 capital plan. As Bill referenced, we submitted our 2016 capital plans just a couple of weeks ago and we will disclose more on this matter once we are advice of the results.", "As a result of our capital return program, we are driving down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. The positive impact of our capital return program can be seen in year-over-year results where 5% net income growth translated into 8% earnings per share growth, as our long-term shareholders received a slightly larger ownership stake every quarter. Over several years, the compounding effect of a lower share count combined with our steadily increasing dividend is an important component of our owner\u2019s long-term returns.", "Moving to the segment overviews, let\u2019s begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on Slide 12. Net income decreased $15 million sequentially as continued market volatility resulted in lower wealth management related income, it was $30 million higher compared to the prior year. As a result of higher net interest income and improved asset quality. Net interest income was stable sequentially and up 5% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth coupled with our continued focus on balance sheet optimization.", "More specifically, our direct consumer lending businesses continue to exhibit strong momentum with average balances up $2 billion or 20% year-over-year. As a result of the investments we\u2019ve made in enhancing both our product offerings and client experience. In addition, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth up 2% sequentially and 3% versus the prior year.", "Non-interest income was down 5% sequentially and 2% year-over-year as our wealth management related revenue streams have been pressured by market volatility and lower assets under management. Growing our wealth management business continues to be a key strategic priority for SunTrust and we remain focused on retaining and recruiting top-talent and efforts to both grow AUM and expand our client base.", "Asset quality remained strong with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. Going forward, we expect the improvements in the home equity portfolio to abate, thus resulting in increased provision expense associated with loan growth. Non-interest expense increased 2% year-over-year due to continued investments in technology, higher marketing expenditures and growth in revenue generating positions. The efficiency ratio was stable as revenue growth and cost saving initiatives funded these investments. Overtime, we continue to see opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness within this business, as we realize the benefits of our technology investments and work to deepen client relationships and increase teammate productivity.", "Moving on the wholesale banking, we had another solid quarter. Revenues were up 4% sequentially and year-over-year as a result of higher net interest income driven by strong balance sheet growth and higher non-interest income. Capital markets related income was up $7 million sequentially and up modestly versus the prior year, despite the decline in industry transaction volume. Our strong performance relative to the market is the direct result of our successful execution of two multi-year strategies. Deepening client relationships and meeting the capital markets needs of all SunTrust clients. Across both these fronts, we saw evidence of success in the first quarter.", "First, our average fee per transaction in the first quarter was up 16% compared to 2015, reflective of our increasingly prominent role on client transactions. Second, capital markets related income generated by commercial, CRE and PWM clients was up $10 million compared to the first quarter of 2015. We expect these trends to continue as we bring our full capabilities and one team approach to all SunTrust clients. Net interest income continued its positive trajectory up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. This is primarily due to strong loan and deposit growth, the latter of which is driven by the increased value that our liquidity specialists are providing our clients and the investments we\u2019ve made to enhance our treasury and payment product offers.", "Overall, revenue growth continues to outpace expense growth resulting in 100 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio versus the prior year. This positive operating leverage has funded strategic investments in revenue growth initiatives, including the build out of our industry and corporate finance expertise within commercial banking, enhancements to our treasury platform, upgrades to our client facing infrastructure and further talent acquisitions.", "Despite the strong revenue growth, net income declined both sequentially and year-over-year as a result of increased provision expense driven by loan growth, increased energy related reserves and moderating asset quality improvements. Looking ahead, while market conditions can be choppy and credit costs will normalize, our wholesale banking business is highly differentiated. Our broad product capabilities and industry expertise combined with our one team approach will continue to bring increasing value to our clients and shareholders.", "Moving to the mortgage segment, which has become a more steady contributor to the Company\u2019s bottom-line. Non-interest income increased 9% sequentially driven by both production and servicing. The $7 million increase in production income is largely due to higher refinancing activity in reaction to the decline in rates we saw this quarter, which also enabled higher gain on sale margins. Servicing income increased by $6 million due to improved net hedge performance and a lower decay expense. With relatedly, we purchased $8 billion of MSRs in the first quarter, $2 billion of which was on our system as of March 31st and $6 billion of which will transfer during the second quarter. This is consistent with our strategy to grow our servicing portfolio as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business.", "Application activity was up 37% sequentially and was strong across both refinance and purchase lines. Given this combined with the onset of the spring selling season, we would expect second quarter mortgage production income to increase from first quarter levels. Some of this will be partially offset by a decline in servicing income as decay expense which is recorded at loan closing will increase as the refinance application activity in the first quarter is closed in the second quarter.", "Net interest income declined both sequentially and versus the prior year driven by the decline in mortgage loan spreads given the low interest rate environment. Expenses remain well controlled as continued focus of expense discipline and reduced credit related expenses have funded investments to further improve efficiency and the client experience. Net income declined $23 million sequentially entirely due to a lower reserve release, as the improvement in mortgage credit quality while still ongoing moderates.", "Big picture, while the benefit from reserve releases within this business will decline. Our continued focus on originating high quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence, delivering an improved client experience and gaining smart market share should contribute to the earnings growth of the Company. And with that, I will turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives.", "Bill Rogers", "Great, thanks Aleem. And to conclude I\u2019m going to point to Slide 15 which highlights how this quarter\u2019s performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have had in place for several years now. First, the diversity of our business model helped us deliver 5% revenue growth despite challenging market conditions. Second, our profitability continues to improve as a result of our strategic focus on improving efficiency and optimizing the balance sheet to enhance returns. These two strategies which we\u2019ve been working on since 2011 are key contributors to the 220 basis point reduction in the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio and the 21 basis point improvement in NIM. This focus on expense management has also provided us the capacity to make consistent investments in the Company. As an example, we continue to see the benefits for the investments we\u2019ve been making in CIB over the last 10 years and are also encouraged by the results we\u2019re seeing from our commercial and CRE businesses.", "Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and is demonstrating good momentum. Also, our digital investments continue to pay-off in consumer banking with steady increases in mobile usage and self-service deposits. And in mortgage, we continue to make targeted investments for growth across both origination and servicing. Lastly our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce share count. Our goal is to continue this trend. So big picture, our revenue trajectory is improving, expenses remain well-controlled, credit quality outside of energy remains favorable, and our capital position is strong. So I\u2019m pleased with the continued progress and I remain highly optimistic about our Company\u2019s future. And with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur to begin the Q&A portion.", "Ankur Vyas", "Great, Jake, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open. ", "Ken Usdin", "Aleem, if I could just a question on the net interest margin and the NII performance, which is really good. You mentioned in the comments, you had some help from premium amortization you had a little help from swaps and we know you have taken out that swap slide. But can you just talk to us about, if you can help us understand those helpers and then the bias for the down NIM would that just be some normalization of those factors or is that the rollover rates that you\u2019re seeing underneath?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, first of all on swaps and amortization. Yes, I\u2019d characterize those as small helpers, if I think about 2016 relative to 2015, we\u2019re expecting, because we were able to restructure a part of our portfolio in 2015. We are expecting slightly lower levels of premium amortization in \u201916 relative to \u201915. But we\u2019re talking about sort of single-digit millions per quarter, these aren\u2019t big numbers. Likewise, if I think about the swap book \u201916 relative to \u201915, most of the changes in our swap book have actually already taken place. So one of the reasons, we took that slide out from here Ken is that, we don\u2019t expect to see much change in swaps year-over-year from here, most of the changes have already occurred. And so we\u2019re really ought to be thinking about NIM and NII in total rather than sort of zooming in on one part of our interest rate risk management, that\u2019s the reason we took it out. And I don\u2019t think that those are sort of large numbers in the context of our overall rate risk and rate management perspective.", "To your point on NIM from here, the main -- we\u2019ve got sort of several drivers, why we\u2019re expecting a small grind down in NIM from here. The new production yield is still probably slightly lower than current portfolio yields. So as the portfolio turns over that will be a slight negative. Remember that the LCR requirement for banks our size goes up at the end of this year. And so as we build out our securities portfolio to meet the higher requirement at the end of this year, that will be a slight drag on NIM although it will be actually a little bit of a help to NII. And so those are a couple of reasons why you\u2019ll see probably slightly lower NIM and NIM will grind down a little bit over the course of the year. But in context, so if you think about the last several years. NIM was coming down at a pretty rapid pace and we got good loan growth, we got good deposit growth, we were able to hold NII about flat over the last several years even in the face of all of that declining NIM. So now that the pace of NIM decline is moderating, as a result of that first Fed hike I am expected that we\u2019ll see some NII improvements over the course of the year.", "Ken Usdin", "And one question for Bill, on the loan side, you mentioned -- we see the big improvement in C&I just some -- over the last two quarters now. Can you just elaborate on your points about the underlying customer and are you seeing an underlying strengthening in just the C&I demand specifically?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes. I think it actually has been pretty consistent. If you sort of look at loans overall and my comments was probably more general. Our production over the last eight quarters has been pretty consistent, production was a little higher this quarter and the ebbs and flows of that relates to paydowns, pay-offs, loan sales, utilization and this quarter we -- those were ditched, and we had a little higher production, we had fewer paydowns we obviously didn\u2019t have any loan sales and utilization was a little bit up. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a specific trend I think it\u2019s sort of a continuation of a consistent trend over the last few quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Following up on your comments on commercial business.", "Bill Rogers", "Hi Gerard can you speak up a little we are having trouble hearing you?", "Gerard Cassidy", "Bill speaking of the commercial lending area, what are you guys seeing in underwriting standards both in commercial real estate and commercial loans and are you seeing any stabilization in the spreads for either of those products?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes I\u2019d say if I sort of go down the spectrum, if you start with the higher end of the broadly syndicated market yes we\u2019re absolutely seeing stabilization there and that\u2019s obviously market impacted and liquidity impacted. If you go down smaller into the commercial market, I think first it\u2019s still pretty competitive and we\u2019re seeing that not seeing the same level of stabilization then if you go to CRE, I think that\u2019s probably the most impacted by reduction in the liquidity so we are seeing from a pricing standpoint some return on CRE. I think we\u2019re also seeing some revert to the mean on structure in terms of CRE. So I think the answer is yes all of everything I\u2019ve said is on the margin now.", "Gerard Cassidy", "And then coming back you Aleem I really appreciated your view on the return of capital and the compounding effect that has had for shareholder returns. In the vein, return on equity for the industry and for yourselves obviously has been impacted by the high capital levels everyone has to carry now as well as the lower interest rate environment in suggesting that some people\u2019s return on equity is below cost of capital. How do you guys see getting your ROE over 10% and in the next 12 to 24 months, is it truly tied to just rates going higher or there is other things that you\u2019re looking at? Thank you.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well I think the first component of getting our ROE up as an industry overall is getting our ROA up and there are several levers you\u2019ve seen the industry pull to do that, right. Net interest income as I said earlier to Ken I expect we\u2019re actually going to see a little growth in net interest income irrespective of rates and to the extent that we do get some rate hikes that growth will accelerate. The industry\u2019s ability to grow non-interest income as it has been pressured in the past but I think you\u2019re seeing us and other players also look for other businesses and other ways to meet more client needs to grow that and of course efficiency. Just improving productivity, improving our overall efficiency that all of those things are helping grow ROA to the extent that we are then able to take that growth in ROA and translate that to accelerating growth in ROE managing capital as best as we can. Obviously that is not all in our hands but you\u2019ve seen payout ratios grow pretty substantially over the last several years. In our case, last year we were in the sort of mid 60% pay-out ratio still lower than we would like but our ability to grow pay-out ratio when returning capital will be one of those levers of many that I think where we will be able to grow ROE overtime.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Can you talk about the approach to managing expenses for the rest of the year, obviously you have us the reiteration of hoping to improve the efficiency ratio versus last year. But if I remember correctly that you have one target of expenses for your base case driving yield and then you had another kind of fall back option if revenue was tracking below expectations. So, how are you thinking about managing the Company on the expense side given your revenue outlook today?", "Bill Rogers", "And you know Matt we talk about this a lot. I mean we stayed focused on managing to an efficiency ratio versus an expense level as a dollar level. So I think we\u2019re ahead of the game where we normally are in the first quarter relative to the efficiency ratio. We had a little higher revenue that you saw the expense that goes along with that. And the goal right now will be not to give that away. It\u2019s not to give the gains that we\u2019ve made in the efficiency ratio away. We\u2019ve made a commitment to continue to improve, we\u2019ve been doing that now for some 4 years plus. So the focus is going to be on not giving away the improvement that we made in the efficiency ratio and improve relative to \u201915. Now all that being said, we have lots and lots of expense initiatives that we\u2019re constantly putting forth as a strategy and the different levels and intensity of how we pull those varies relative to what we see in terms of expectations and they are also allowing us to continue to make investments in our Company, so as we continue on our expense mission, we also have an investment opportunity in terms of total revenue and future of the Company.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "And then just separately Aleem any color on how many securities or how many liquidity you have to build to meet the next round of LCR requirements?", "Aleem Gillani", "It\u2019s not all that substantial Matt the increase in requirements goes from 90% to 100% we\u2019re obviously in excess of the 90% as it is. So the amount of the increase to get from where we are to a little over 200% grew it\u2019s not all that large.", "Operator", "Next we have Michael Rose of Raymond James. Your line is open.", "Michael Rose", "Just wanted to touch on loan growth a little bit you guys have grown at a high single-digit annualized past couple quarters, obviously really good momentum. How should we think about the pipelines from here? And obviously your growth was still a lot stronger than GDP, so how should we think about loan growth for the rest of the year and kind of what are the offsets in the energy run off? Thanks.", "Bill Rogers", "Yes I know as I said earlier but we don\u2019t really manage to our loan growth number. I mean to me loan growth is an outcome what I look at is what you\u2019ve asked about is I look at pipelines and production and pipelines and productions have been very consistent over the last several quarters. As I said earlier, production was a little higher this quarter and if we didn\u2019t have some of the offsets and pay downs. So I think you\u2019re going to have some give and take so we sort of go down the portfolio to your point I think CRE will be lower production but that won\u2019t necessarily reflect itself an outstanding because we\u2019ve had good production in the past so a lot of that is construction related, people are completing their projects, there is less liquidity in the system so that\u2019s liable to stay outstanding for a little bit longer than it had in the past. So, there will be some interesting offsets to CREs specifically.", "As we go to C&I, pipelines continue to be good, our strategies are effective. We\u2019ll be very focused on return so we\u2019ll be aggressive where we think we can get a lot of return and we won\u2019t be as aggressive where we don\u2019t think we can get the appropriate return. Consumer, I think that will continue to grow as you\u2019ve seen the initiatives that we\u2019ve had in place and the investments that we\u2019ve made in consumers. So as a production basis that will continue to grow sort of in the double-digit side. But again a little bit offset by the runoff in home equity. So, there are give and takes of all this which is again why I am sort of careful not to say loan growth as a number is the thing we want to give guidance around but pipelines are healthy and the strategies that we have in place are working.", "Michael Rose", "Maybe if I follow-up just looking at the Slide 18 on the energy portfolio, thanks for providing it this quarter. Just if you guys can just help me reconcile the criticized in the E&P book versus the oilfield services, because I think clearly me and most investors see kind of a oilfield service as the bigger risk category. I mean is there is a tail risk there and maybe how would you kind of quantify that or classify it over the next few quarters? Thanks.", "Bill Rogers", "Well I think that\u2019s where investors have seen a little bit more of the risk. In our case, if I think about our oilfield service. Well E&P and oilfield services combined as you know that\u2019s only 38% of our total book so that\u2019s not significant. And within oilfield services the majority of our oilfield services exposure is either investment grade or what we would characterize as investment grades from our internal rating systems or is supported by assets, as asset backed lending. So the majority of our book actually in oilfield services on a risk basis may be a little bit lower risk than we used to see it.", "Operator", "Next question is from John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "John McDonald", "The capital market fees as you mentioned outperformed the big investment banks this quarter. And you touched a little bit on the business model being a differentiator. Aleem just kind of wondering did you feel the cyclical headwinds of reduced capital markets activity on deal lines and issuance and just a little bit more color on how you powered through that?", "Aleem Gillani", "We absolutely did. As you know the market in January and February was decidedly weak and decidedly volatile and we certainly felt that in the first two months of the quarter but as the market stabilized in March our teammates absolutely came through and you know this has been a 10 year strategy for us investment into our CIB business and bringing our one team approach across all aspects of commercial CRE and corporate banking has really helped. I think that we have grown market share over the last 10 years, certainly over the last year also and that growth and share really showed up this quarter.", "Bill Rogers", "I\u2019d add to that what Aleem said is it\u2019s really sort of a continuation of the strategy. We\u2019ve had record quarters in the last two quarters relative to CRE and commercial banking and the activity that they\u2019re doing to contribute to the that investment banking line and also the continuation of strategy year-over-year our average fee meaning we are sort of improving in relative importance. So, even if the units aren\u2019t the same, the value of those units are a lot higher, and so it\u2019s up almost 35% year-over-year. So, the strategy also is manifesting itself and moving down that left side relative to importance to our clients.", "John McDonald", "Okay. So is there any -- these are hard to predict line items but is there any reason this wouldn\u2019t be a good jumping off point for the rest of the year in terms of the performance you did this quarter on the fees and should things get cyclically a little bit better given that March kind of improved?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, I mean relative to this quarter or to this line item, investment banking specifically I would expect this as a good jumping off point, I would expect the second quarter to be better than the first quarter. All that being said, these are choppy markets, I mean we -- this was a tail of the last part of the quarter was really good and the first two-thirds of the quarter were not. So we\u2019re heading in the quarter with some momentum. I would expect it to be a little bit better but against the second quarter of last year which was a record. So I am not sure we\u2019ll be at that level but I think we can improve relative to this quarter and have that be a good as you said launching pad for the year.", "Operator", "Next question is from Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Kevin Barker", "In your energy portfolio, the oilfield services has been performing better than those peers with only 32% criticized. How much of that lower criticized is primarily due to hedges that are still on the oilfield services and do you see a bunch rolling off through 2016?", "Bill Rogers", "Kevin I\u2019m not sure how much of that relates to hedges. I\u2019ll tell you one of the reasons why oilfield services for us may not be performing as badly as you would expect relative to others. Part of our oilfield services business includes clients who don\u2019t cover solely the energy industry. They\u2019ve got other businesses as part of their overall business and so even though we categorize that for us as oilfield services it\u2019s perhaps a lower risk base and a broader client base than you might see at other firms.", "Kevin Barker", "And then a follow-up on the loan growth comments that you made earlier. You\u2019ve obviously put a lot more emphasis on LightStream in that platform over the past year. Could you detail how much of your incremental loan growth that we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of quarters was due to LightStream and what average yields you were getting from the products that are sold through that platform?", "Bill Rogers", "Now the overall loan growth and we think about this segment as our consumer direct, LightStream, Greensky, Credit Card other products that fit into our overall consumer direct strategy and loan growth there and that business has been very substantial. It is a 20% year-over-year loan growth and we\u2019re very happy with that business. We\u2019re very happy also by the way with the credit quality that we\u2019re seeing in that business and we\u2019re going to continue to expect to be able to meet more clients\u2019 needs and broaden out that business overtime.", "Kevin Barker", "What average yields are you seeing in that consumer direct channel?", "Bill Rogers", "I don\u2019t have that number right off the top of my head Kevin. We\u2019ll ask Ankur to back to you on the yields and components of that business.", "Operator", "Next question is from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Matt Burnell", "Just a follow-up I guess a little bit on the capital return story. I realized there is not a lot you can say about your CCAR submission. But I am curious about conceptually how you\u2019re thinking about the potential for energy related credit cost to affect the overall payout ratio relative to the upcoming capital planning cycle versus 2015. You mentioned 2015, you were at sort of mid 60% ratio, does any concern about oil related credit affect your thinking about the capital return story going forward?", "Bill Rogers", "Well the way that the submission is structured, as you know there is a extremely adverse case it is a hypothetical case that the FRB and regulators create that we are required to submit against. That assumes basically not just a recession but a depression and assumes therefore very high levels of provisioning and charge-offs, incorporated within that case we incorporated a sensitivity on our energy portfolio. And so submitted that, our -- whatever our result is and our ability to grow our pay-out ratio overtime already incorporates that number within it Matt so if we receive a positive result in June, it will already have included that number with that Matt.", "Matt Burnell", "And then just secondly, you mentioned some of the challenges affecting the private wealth management business at least in the relatively near-term. I guess I\u2019m curious how you think about the Department of Labour rule and does that have a meaningful impact on your private wealth management business?", "Bill Rogers", "Yes Matt I don\u2019t -- we -- so to start as a framework, we\u2019ve been fiduciaries for over 100 years so our private wealth business has sort of have been dominated by our fiduciary component of our business. So, it\u2019s a concept that we\u2019re certainly comfortable with. We\u2019re obviously guiding through the order and spending some time. Our teams have been thinking about this for a long time in terms of structural changes and being ready. So, I think this is in the highly manageable category will it have a marginal impact? Maybe, will it also have some opportunity relative to others? Maybe, so, I don\u2019t think this is going to be a big story in terms of change in direction of our private wealth business.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Vivek Juneja", "A couple of question Bill, Aleem, first in terms of the increased capital return you talk about, how are you thinking about dividends versus buybacks?", "Bill Rogers", "Well Vivek, we\u2019ve talked with several of our owners and the kind of feedbacks that we\u2019ve received overtime is that they\u2019ve liked our balanced approach, they\u2019ve liked the way that we\u2019ve been able to grow dividends and buyback over the course of several years and we would anticipate that that type of a balanced approach is going to continue to be what our owners would like to see from us in the future.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. Is there a payout ratio Aleem you\u2019re trying to target on the dividend side?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well no not that of specific ones Vivek, there are a couple of points and when you think about total payout ratio in the past SunTrust has been running sort of between 60% and 80%. We\u2019re glad that we moved up within that band last year and we hope to continue progress this year and specifically to dividends you\u2019re aware of the regulatory guidance that anything over 30% require or will receive increased scrutiny. I\u2019ll tell you I don\u2019t know exactly what that means but I know that I don\u2019t want it. So we\u2019ll probably -- you can probably anticipate that we will keep that in mind.", "Vivek Juneja", "Okay. And a different question, just switching gears. On the consumer direct, can you talk a little bit about the credit metrics of what you are underwriting?", "Bill Rogers", "Consumer direct.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes that is a good one, credit metrics overall well I think probably the biggest point to make there is when you think about charge-offs. Charge-offs for our LightStream and Greensky businesses combined in the first quarter of this year were less than $2 million. So, as you think about $3.5 billion in portfolio and less than $2 million in actual charge-offs that\u2019s a pretty terrific set of credit metrics.", "Bill Rogers", "And Vivek it is also, as you know this is a prime, super prime portfolio focus so the average FICO scores and LightStream and Greensky are 760/750 plus. So this is sort of a different strategy related to this portfolio for us.", "Operator", "All right, our last question comes from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.", "Marty Mosby", "I wanted to ask you about as you look at expenses from one quarter to the next so if you just kind of roll into the next, you have the seasonal expenses, on employee benefits that goes down and then you have some seasonal expenses in other that goes up. And then how is your investment kind of trajectory? So I will just kind of think of those three things and will they net-out to stable expenses or somewhat of a maybe a give back or a down expense which would show what we saw last year which was a big improvement in efficiencies going from first to second quarter?", "Bill Rogers", "Well Marty as we think about expenses, you know what we do is we focus on the efficiency ratio rather than sort of individual expense line items and our philosophy is to continue to try to improve operating leverage and improve the efficiency ratio overall. Having said that, if I think about that and the expense line for this year, one of the things that we\u2019ve said earlier this year is we expect our quarterly expenses to average between $1.3 billion and $1.35 billion with that number being contingent on revenue obviously as we focus on the efficiency ratio. I don\u2019t think that there is much of a change to that with stable revenues I would continue to think about expenses averaging and I say that carefully averaging between 1.3 billion and 1.35 billion we might get quarters higher or quarters lower. But that is kind of a expense base for us I think is the fair number for you to anticipate and model.", "Marty Mosby", "And then you talk about the improvement in a sense of some stabilization in the energy related non-performers in criticized that you likely kind of have gotten ahead of that issue given the metrics that we\u2019re seeing in the portfolio that looks favorable. You didn\u2019t really breakout the provision in a sense of that how much of roughly $100 million is related to energy this particular quarter and the buildup of some of those non-performers and is there kind of a path that you could see we\u2019re actually provisioning begins to actually may be leg down a bit just because the rest of the portfolio is performing so well?", "Bill Rogers", "If you\u2019d look at this quarter Marty, our provision for energy was about $30 million and about half of that was a charge-off and about half of that was a reserve build to give you a sense of sizing that is how to look at Q1. If I think about going forward from here though the rest of the year our overall energy reserves I think can play out a couple of different ways. Assuming there is no oil price drop, right assuming that oil prices are relatively stable to where they are now, I think a couple of things can happen, one our energy reserves can be relatively stable, as we have charge-offs we continue to provide for those and maintain our reserve coverage about where it is or two, energy reserves could decline as we work through certain credits and as the formation of problem credits from here close. So I think excluding a big decline in energy prices I can see either of those scenarios from here.", "Ankur Vyas", "This concludes our call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today.

You may begin.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thank you, Christine. Good morning and welcome to SunTrust\u2019s second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.", "With me today, among other members of our Executive Management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements.

Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.", "William Rogers", "Great. Thanks, Ankur and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details including our results at the business segment level. I\u2019ll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter\u2019s performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis.", "To start I'm pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. For several years we've been on a path to grow and diversify the business, improved profitability and increase our capital return to shareholders. This quarter you saw our continued progress in each of these areas. Specifically our ongoing commitment to invest in revenue growth opportunities while also tightly managing expenses resulted in solid improvements and efficiency.", "Additionally, as most of you are aware, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan which calls for a 23% increase in total capital return relative to our 2015 plan. This is a result of our strong capital position and improved financial performance and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.", "Now getting into the specifics, we reported $0.94 of earnings per share this quarter which included certain discrete items that netted to a $0.05 benefit to the bottom line, but which did not meaningfully impact the current quarter's efficiency ratio. Aleem will provide some more detail on these items later, but thematically, they help better position our Company for the future, particularly as it relates to optimizing our branch delivery network.", "Excluding these items and the $0.03 of discrete tax benefits from a year ago EPS increased 3% a solid performance, particularly given the $120 million year-over-year increase in loan loss provision. This performance was supported by a strong revenue growth as total revenues grew 6% sequentially, and 7% year-over-year.", "The sequential improvement was driven by higher non-interest income and the year-over-year improvement was driven largely by increased net interest income reflecting the diversity of our business model. This revenue growth combined with tightly controlled expenses resulted in a 60.1% tangible efficiency ratio this quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to both prior quarter and prior year.", "Net interest income was up slightly compared to the first quarter, as solid loan growth offset for five basis point decline in NIM. Non-interest income was up nearly a $120 million sequentially reflecting the strong execution in both favorable and volatile markets by our mortgage and investment banking teams.", "Average loan and deposit growth this quarter was 2% and 3% respectively driven by solid economic conditions in our markets combined with the onboard investments we've made and continue to make in our businesses. As anticipated we continue to resolve problem energy credits, which drove the 14 basis point sequential increase in net charge-offs and the three basis point decline in the NPL ratio.", "Outside of energy, asset quality remains very strong as evidenced by only 19 basis points of net charge-offs for the rest of the Bank. Tangible book value per share increased 3% sequentially and 12% from the prior year and our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio declined slightly to 9.7% all reflective of continued improvements and probability combined with effective capital deployment. The course we have set has us performing at a higher level and will continue to propel us into the future.", "So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Aleem, to provide more details on this quarter\u2019s performance.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. Let's move on to Slide 4 and taking a look at that slide you'll see that our net interest margin declined five basis points primarily due to lower earning asset yields. As the decline in long-term rates increased premium amortization expense and the low level of absolute rates lowered reinvestment rates across multiple asset classes.", "In addition increased long-term debt combined with slightly higher deposit costs contributed to two basis points of the sequential decline. However, net interest income increased $6 million from the prior quarter as solid 2% average loan growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline a further three to five basis points next quarter.", "This potential decline is more than we previously anticipated largely due to the significant flattening of the yield curve over the past few months. We're continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk.", "Moving to Slide 5, non-interest income increased $117 million sequentially driven by mortgage which benefited from lower rates other non-interest income and capital markets. Mortgage production income increased $51 million benefiting from strong increases in both purchase and refinancing activity.", "In addition we simplified our product offering to include upfront origination fees, and the all-in loan yield, rather than as a separate fee. This change modestly impacts the timing of revenue recognition and increased this quarter's mortgage production income by approximately $10 million.", "Other non-interest income increased $37 million primarily due to a gain associated with the sale leaseback of one of our office buildings, which further supports our strategy to reduce our real estate footprint and provides us with increased flexibility in the future.", "Investment banking had a strong quarter with revenues increasing $28 million as we continue to see the combination of our long-term investments and strategy deliver solid results for our clients and shareholders. Partially offsetting this increase was a $21 million decrease in trading income, which was largely driven by higher CVA costs, due both to a change in our methodology for calculating counterparty reserves for derivatives and as a result of lower rates.", "Client related transaction fees, which includes service charges, card fees, and other fees increased $25 million from the prior quarter, not only due to typical seasonal patterns, but also due to an increase in loan commitment fees in STRH, associated with M&A related bridge financing. Separately, as a reminder, once we fully implement our enhanced posting order process in Q4 of this year, we will see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter.", "Let's move on to expenses. Non-interest expense increased $27 million relative to the prior quarter primarily due to discrete charges associated with ongoing efficiency initiatives. These charges were recorded in other non-interest expense and are generally associated with our ongoing branch network optimization efforts. While the savings from these efforts will not be material in the context of our total expense base, they will help continue to make us a more effective company.", "In addition, FDIC premium and regulatory exam expenses increased $8 million due to higher assessment fees primarily due to a growing deposit base and a higher assessment rate, the latter of which is mostly due to the increase in non-performing energy loans in recent quarters.", "As a reminder, assessment costs will increase an additional $10 million in the third quarter as a result of the FDIC\u2019s new surcharge. Partially offsetting these increases were lower employee compensation expenses, marketing expenses and net occupancy expenses, the latter of which included $6 million of discrete benefits. In comparison to the second quarter of last year, non-interest expense was up 1% largely due to these same discrete charges.", "As you can see on Slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio was 60.1% in the second quarter, an improvement of 350 basis points year-over-year as revenue growth exceeded expense growth. While this quarter's performance was strong, we do not believe a 60% efficiency ratio is our new run rate for the remainder of this year.", "With that said, our year-to-date progress keeps us on track to meet our objective of improving the efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year. The continued low interest rate environment will clearly impact our go forward trajectory. However, we remain committed to maintaining strong expense discipline and achieving our long-term goal of a sub 60% efficiency ratio.", "Turning to Slide 8, asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters. With the divergence between energy and non-energy related performance. Excluding energy, our loan portfolio continues to perform very well evidenced by charge-off of only 19 basis points in the second quarter, and stable to slightly improving delinquency levels.", "With respect to energy, we charged off $70 million of loans and our non-performing loans declined from $420 million to $354 million. The total criticized ratio which includes non-accrual loans and criticized accruing loans, remained relatively stable at 30%. Total ALLL for the Company was relatively flat from the prior quarter as growth in the total loan portfolio was offset by continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio.", "Total provision expense increased $45 million compared to the first quarter primarily due to the energy charge-offs. From here and assuming no significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we expect NPL levels to decline as we resolve existing energy NPL\u2019s. We continue to expect the Company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full-year 2016.", "We expect our allowance to be relatively stable in the near-term which should result in a provision expense that approximates net charge-offs. In addition, we expect energy charge-offs to abate as we move through the remainder of 2016 and thus we do expect the total provision expense to decline relative to the second quarter level.", "Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial construction, while consumer loan growth was generally broad-based. Our consumer lending strategies continue to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels.", "In addition, our overall lending pipelines and dialogue with clients continue to be solid, which we believe is reflective of a steady U.S. economy. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.1 billion or 6% driven by 5% growth in C&I and 15% growth in total consumer loans and was partially offset by declines in home equity and payoffs in commercial real estate.", "Turning to Slide 10, average client deposits increased 3% compared to the prior quarter and 8% year-over-year partially due to a large temporary deposit associated with a client related M&A transaction, but largely due to the core growth across most products and businesses. Period and deposits were stable sequentially given typical seasonal patterns from Q1 to Q2.", "Over the past two years client deposits are up 15%. This success as a result of our increased focus on meeting more of our clients deposit and payment needs. Our investments and technology platforms and ultimately our teammates and both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments.", "Rates paid on deposits increased one basis point sequentially, a lagged effect of the December rate increase. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.", "Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2016 CCAR process, and our relative performance within that Bank group continues to be strong. This is most notably evidenced by SunTrust continuing to have amongst the lowest levels of loan losses and capital erosion in the severely adverse economic scenario relative to other CCAR Banks.", "This progress reflects the significant and cumulative actions we have taken over the past five years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the quality of new loan production. The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $960 million over the coming four quarters. In addition, we will increase our common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.26 subject to Board approval.", "In total, this represents a 23% increase and total capital return to shareholders relative to our previous plan. Alongside our increases in capital return, we've also organically added approximately $500 of common equity Tier 1 over the past year and maintain strong capital levels evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially and up 12% compared to the prior year driven by growth and retained earnings and higher AOCI, as a result of lower long-term interest rates.", "Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements and we added approximately $1 billion to our securities portfolio in the second quarter to make further progress toward the increased 2017 requirements.", "Moving to the segment overviews, we will begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on Slide 12. Net income declined $10 million sequentially and $38 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by a higher provision expense and discrete expenses recognized in the current quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net income trends were also negatively impacted by lower wealth management related income.", "Net interest income was stable sequentially and was up 4% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, which more than offset the lower net interest margin. Our consumer direct lending businesses continue to exhibit strong movement. Specifically, average balances are up $2.7 billion or 26% year-over-year, as a result of the investments we have made. In addition to market share gains, we've been able to take in certain businesses, resulting from our strong and stable funding base.", "Further, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 4% sequentially and 6% versus the prior year. Some of this growth is due to the large temporary client deposit I mentioned earlier, but the majority of that reflects our emphasis on delivering the Bank's full capabilities to all of our clients.", "Both the solid loan and deposit growth trends in CPWM over the past couple of years reflect the increased momentum this business has created in acquiring new clients and deepening existing relationships. Non-interest income was up 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher transaction related fees due to increased consumer activity and normal seasonality.", "The year-over-year decline was driven by lower wealth management related revenue which has been pressured by lower assets under management and heightened market volatility. Non-interest expense increased 2% and 4% on a sequential and year-over-year basis respectively. These increases were primarily driven by discrete charges in the current quarter related to our branch network optimization efforts, which I discussed earlier in the presentation.", "Optimizing our network continues to be a critical strategic priority, so that we continue to serve our clients when, where, and how they want to do business. In conjunction with branch optimization, profitably growing our consumer lending and wealth management business remains a primary focus in this segment. Executing these priorities should result in steady improvements in both efficiency and the client experience over time.", "Moving to wholesale banking, increased credit costs continue to put some downward pressure on net income, but overall client activity levels and market share continue to improve. Revenues were up 1% sequentially due entirely the higher investment banking income. Within investment banking, we had a record quarter in both investment grade bonds and equity originations. The growth of both of these businesses is a strong reflection of the continued strategic investments we've made in recent years.", "As an example, we've increased the number of publishing equity research analysts by 30% over the past two years. As a result, our broker rankings have improved and our equity related revenue is growing. Offsetting the increase in investment banking income was a $20 million sequential decline and trading income. The vast majority of this decline was driven by the higher CVA costs I discussed earlier, and excluding this, we would characterize core client trading activity in the second quarter as solid.", "Moving to the mortgage segment, which was a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Non-interest income increased $41 million sequentially and $60 million year-over-year. Sequential increase was driven entirely by production income, which was up $51 million as a result of greater purchase and refinancing activity in addition to higher gain on sale margins.", "As anticipated, servicing income declined $10 million sequentially as a result of the increased decay expense related to elevated refinancing activity. This was partially offset by additional servicing fees driven by growth in the servicing portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, servicing income increased $22 million due to improved hedge performance, and a 6% increase in the size of our service for others portfolio. These increases in non-interest income combined with strong expense management drove the $19 million sequential and $6 million year-over-year increase in the bottom line.", "Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity points to continued positively momentum in mortgage production volumes in response to the low rate environment. While we do not expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate meaningful improvement relative to the third quarter of last year. At a higher level, we continue to be pleased with the increased consistency, improved execution, and targeted growth the mortgage business is delivering to our clients and shareholders.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives.", "William Rogers", "Okay. Great, thanks Aleem. So to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 7% year-over-year revenue growth.", "We have delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and non-interest income and across all three major business segments. In addition, our businesses are working better to deliver the entire bank to our clients. Second, our probability continues to improve as a result of our commitment to tightly manage expenses and drive positive operating leverage. We\u2019ve improved the year-to-date efficiency ratio relative to 2015, putting us well on track to meet our commitment to improve efficiency on an annual basis for the fifth consecutive year.", "Third, we've been using many of these efficiency gains to fund growth investments in the Company. There is an example; this quarter was our second best quarter ever for investment banking. We are particularly encouraged by the growth of our core advisory businesses, which take a long-time to develop and are the product of over 10 years of investment.", "Today, equity and M&A related revenue account for 39% of investment banking income which was our highest percentage ever. In mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology which has resulted in solid growth and allows us to capitalize on the current market conditions. Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years, and is demonstrating strong consistent momentum.", "Also our investments in consumer banking, private wealth management, and treasury and payment solutions are yielding strong results with more clients and trusting their deposits and wealth with SunTrust. And lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce our share count, giving our long-term shareholders a higher ownership stake each quarter.", "Now, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the continued low rate environment, which will place pressure on net interest income and profitability trajectory, even though in the near-term it should be a tailwind to mortgage production and capital markets revenue, and we are well positioned there.", "However, the low interest rate pressure is applicable to the entire industry, and I am confident if we continue to execute our strategy, fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients SunTrust will continue to sustain our outperformance.", "Now with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ankur, and I believe we\u2019ll begin the Q&A.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thanks, Bill. Christine, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] First question is from John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is now open.", "John McDonald", "Hi, good morning guys. Bill just mentioned the challenge at a low rate environment, Aleem can you give a little more color on the NIM outlook, you mentioned three to five basis points next quarter in a flat rate environment? Just walk us through the drivers of that and do you still think you could grow net interest income dollars from the 2Q level, what\u2019s the degree of difficulty on growing and NII from here?", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, John. Yes, if you recall at the start of the year, our view on rates overall was that we were only expecting one interest rate hike in 2016 and we expected that in the latter part of the year. Now with the impact of the vote in the UK, obviously that rate hike looks like it's going to be less probable than we had originally anticipated.", "As a result, if we think about the drivers of NIM from here, we are expecting NIM to grind down a little bit in Q3 perhaps a little bit more in Q4. The main drivers of that would be new production yields across many of our portfolios are still a little bit lower than current portfolio levels.", "Another driver would be that we continue to build our securities portfolio to prepare for 2017 LCR requirements. So for those two reasons, NIM may continue to decline a little bit. But if you think about the last few years on net interest income, what you've seen with us John is that we've been able to use growth and loans and deposits to offset the declines in NIM over the last several years. Even though, our NIM has dropped about 30, 35 basis points over the last few years. Net interest income for us has been until last year very flat.", "In the last year with the growth in NIM, we were able to achieve net interest income really took off and we were on a very steep upward sloping trajectory. From here on with NIM starting to decline, again we do think that with the loan and deposit growth we've got, we will be able to grow net interest income again. However, I'd say that it's going to be at a relatively low pace.", "John McDonald", "Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Good morning.", "William Rogers", "Hi, Matt.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "I think about half of the net charge-offs this quarter for the firm overall related to energy and you did talk about them moderating going forward, but any estimate on how much energy loss in total is left, if oil prices stay around here?", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. Matt, if I take a look at what our energy charge-offs have been over the last three quarters, they've been about $90 million so far over three quarters. If I take a look at the profile that we've got in the book now, how good that looks and of course as you know the majority of our energy book is actually downstream and midstream as opposed to upstream and oilfield services.", "I think we're about halfway through or perhaps more than halfway through in terms of energy charge-offs. And what comes in terms of new energy charge-offs from here might come over the course of the next three or four quarters. So that's why I expect to see declining energy charge-offs from here and therefore a decline in our provision expense from Q2.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "And then as a follow-up, just across the consumer portfolios I think the delinquencies were stable there, but how are the auto portfolio, the online lending subsidiary you have, how are those businesses performing?", "William Rogers", "Yes. Matt, I think remember our portfolio as a prime to super prime portfolio both in the auto as well as in the - particularly in the online portfolio. So the auto book is continued to perform well, 40 basis points charge-offs in early stage below 90 and those are low points, I mean they're low relative to historical numbers, but we've stressed this portfolio, we've looked at it hard, we looked at used car values and all the things that could happen to the portfolio and feel good about where we're positioned again.", "We don't do sub-prime autos, so we sort to stay at a different place as it relates to that and then as it relates to the LightStream business and Greensky I mean remember again super prime business, FICO scores 750/770 kind of you know on the high end of the range and similarly there we\u2019re seeing continued strong credit performance. Consumer\u2019s in good shape I mean particularly if the prime and the super prime level you know all throughout our portfolio, Consumer\u2019s in good shape.", "Matt O\u2019Connor", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Thanks. Good morning.", "William Rogers", "Good morning, Ken.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Kenneth Usdin", "I believe you talked about that, the second half efficiency ratio might not stay down around the 60% level, the strong performance you had this quarter. Typically, you guys tend to have lower expenses in the second half. So I'm just wondering, why can\u2019t it stay down here? And I'll throw my just follow-up in there. Is there something about your expected fees that perhaps you'll see a drip up from the current quarter performance? Thanks.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks Ken. I think you've partially answered your question. Yes, I think there are several things why the efficiency ratio may be a little bit higher in the second half than it was in this quarter. One obviously the NIM decline is going to put - is going to have some downward pressure on net interest income and we're going to be working hard to grow net interest income from here.", "But we know we've got some increased expenses coming up in the second half. FDIC assessment fees will go up $10 million a quarter starting in Q3. Remember, we've got our posting order change coming in Q4, which will probably reduce our fee income by about $10 million a quarter starting in Q4. And then typically for us outside processing and software is on a normal seasonal basis is normally a little bit higher in the second half then it is in the first half as new applications come online over the course of the year and we start amortizing some of that cost.", "So for those reasons I think the overall efficiency ratio you know maybe a little bit higher in the second half then in Q2. But year-over-year I think is the big key. We know and we've always targeted over the last four years, targeted improved efficiency year-over-year. We\u2019ve not actually focused on that much on an individual quarter basis.", "Our intent is to continue to make this Company more effective and more efficient in the current years than it was in the past year and more effective and more efficient in the next year than it was this year. So this year we still do expect to beat our efficiency ratio from last year and then we're going to be looking to see how it can continue to improve next year.", "William Rogers", "Ken this is Bill. I want to be clear on a couple of things I mean obviously we don\u2019t annualize any one quarter from an efficiency ratio even if it's high or if it\u2019s low, we look at sort of that annualized run rate and as Aleem said I mean we're committed to continue to make improvements, but we did get a taste of it, and we sort of like it. So I want to be clear that our intensity is at a very, very high level related to our efficiency ratio and we're not slacken off one single bit.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Understood. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "Good morning, guys.", "William Rogers", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning, John.", "John Pancari", "First on the loan front, just want to see if you can give a little bit of color into the C&I growth, or the C&I trends in the quarter and the period basis looks like your C&I loans were down. So not sure if that's energy or whatnot. So, if you could just talk about that a little bit, and then also your appetite to grow commercial real estate here, just want to get your thoughts there? Thanks.", "William Rogers", "Yes, let me - as we've said many times we're careful not to manage to loan growth. So what I look at as I look at production and then I look at loan sales and pay downs and then I look at utilization. So utilization was actually up just to give a little data point. And generally, I don\u2019t talk a lot about utilization because it goes quarter-to-quarter but this was the highest point in the last several - almost eight quarters. So it's worth noting now it's not a lot, but it's worth noting that\u2019s up.", "Our production numbers for the quarter were actually really good. As a matter of fact, it was one of our higher quarters from a production standpoint, but we also got a little bit of increase in pay downs. So that sort of got the net-net part of that. The C&I portfolio year-over-year has got great room. Again, quarter-to-quarter we\u2019re sort of careful about that, but year-over-year is good solid double-digit growth in C&I loans.", "As it relates to CRE, I think we've said this before, on the production side we're back. I mean that\u2019s somewhat market driven and somewhat driven by our own desires, but outstandings are going to go up a little bit and I think that will trend that way for several quarters as the velocity of construction loans sort of staying on the books a little bit longer by the way which we're happy with high quality, well underwritten. We're happy with, but the velocity of getting those off the books was going to slow a little bit. And part of that you saw in those production numbers I talked about.", "John Pancari", "Got it. That's helpful. And then one last thing Bill to flip over to the capital front. I heard you discussed your deployment plans, in terms of M&A just want to get your updated thoughts there I mean you are one of the few larger banks that can actually do some deals here, but I wanted to get your thoughts on your interest in whole bank M&A and even non-bank? Thanks.", "William Rogers", "Yes. We've been really clear that the bank we like the most is SunTrust and you can see the investments we've been making in our Company and I would include in fairness that the last several years, that\u2019s the equivalent of a lot of small bank acquisitions in terms of investment in our own Company and we like that best. So whole bank M&A really is not a primary focus for us at this particular juncture.", "On the non-bank side, I mean we continue to be interested, we continue to think that there are opportunities there. Generally things that would be fee-income oriented things that would be accretive to our strategies and accretive to our KPI's fast would be the type of priorities.", "Aleem Gillani", "John, you\u2019ve seen this in the last couple of years, we've done a couple of small transactions, small fill-in businesses that help us grow our service level to our clients and we continue to look at those and look for those.", "John Pancari", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Erika Najarian", "Yes. Good morning.", "William Rogers", "Good morning, Erika.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning.", "Erika Najarian", "Just wanted to follow-up a few of your peers had given guidance beyond 2016 given the changed outlook for interest rates. And I'm wondering if you could give us some insight on how much progress you think you can achieve on efficiency improvement beyond 2016 without any assist from rates? And I guess here is my follow-up question is the 69% efficiency ratio at CPWM a potential opportunity? Thanks.", "Aleem Gillani", "Erika, overall as you know we continue to try to grow or improve the efficiency of the Company overall. We are working on several ways to continue to do this. We don't really focus on sort of specific expense control programs. It\u2019s sporadic, intermittent programs don't tend we think to build a culture of continuous improvement.", "And I think what we like about our teammates at SunTrust is that we do have a culture of continuous improvement to try to manage expenses and improve efficiency of the Company overall in every segment. And we continue to look at several ways to continue to do that. We are looking at operations costs, at improving our use of technology overall, we\u2019re continuing to look to optimize our real estate footprint, you saw a little bit of that this quarter with sale leaseback of one particular asset.", "We are being very disciplined in how we manage rules and responsibilities, staffing, and we're looking at that across, we\u2019re looking at these things as well as supplier management, the number of vendors we have across every one of our segments including CPWM. And within consumer banking and private wealth, we\u2019re looking at several ways. We can continue to grow and improve our efficiency there including adding revenue and adding frontline facing teammates who can improve our efficiency ratio actually by growing revenue. So we've got several initiatives underway as part of an overall continuous improvement approach.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. I\u2019d say not much more guidance than we would expect the efficiency to continue to improve irrespective of the rates long-term that slope may change, but we would expect to continue to improve.", "Erika Najarian", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Vivek Juneja of JPMC. Line is now open.", "Vivek Juneja", "Hi, couple of clarifications Bill and Aleem. One thing so - just looking at the absolute level of expenses for the past you\u2019ve given some guidance on it, the $10 million increase in the FDIC assessment fees and obviously up and down based on incentive driven revenues. Other than that anything else on the and obviously we take out the non-core items you highlighted this quarter, taking all that out anything else we should be mindful off as we think about that line?", "William Rogers", "Vivek, if you are asking about sort of core expenses and then revenues relative to what we pointed out. Now, I think what we try to do here is be very, very transparent with you as to all of the non-core items that affected us this quarter. You saw them on the - the major items on the first page of the deck as you say I talked about a couple of the minor items that we see coming up.", "So I think you've got all the information that we can provide on what the core earnings power of the Company is likely to be over the course of the next little while. And I think the one point I would reiterate is from provision expense with everything that we're seeing today, I do expect that to decline as we go forward from today.", "Vivek Juneja", "Great. One more different topic dividend payout, Bill and if you can give us some - so how are you thinking about that, you got a dividend increase, but you are still the lowest some of your regional peers are any thoughts on that?", "William Rogers", "Yes. We set on the course similar to the efficiency ratio to say we want to continue to improve our return to shareholders and we've done that consistently, we've gone from the 60's to the 80's in terms of total return and we've said long-term that sort of that in the zone that we want to be and all that against the backdrop of a really good strong capital level. So I think just on a net basis, we would continue to the same story of efficiency ratio, we continue to improve our return to shareholders, that return probably improvement will be at a smaller slop, but I still think we have an opportunity to increase the return.", "Aleem Gillani", "And Vivek, we had a pretty clear choice in our planned submission this year as to how we could choose to improve dividends or payouts overall. We chose to do it in a balanced way with some dividend increase and some repurchase increase, but as you point out we did lean more toward repurchase and that made a lot of sense to us in the context of stock price that was only around 1.3 times tangible book.", "So that kind of level it makes sense for us to increase the repurchase more than the dividend and every year as we submit our plan, we'll be looking at what those numbers look like. And we also took feedback from many of our largest shareholders as to what their preferences were. So we incorporated that within our plan and we intend to continue to do that.", "Vivek Juneja", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Line is now open.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks. Aleem, I wanted to - this is more just a calculation, but when you did your efficiency ratio I believe the way that you did if I look back in the appendix was you left in the gains in the charges. I don't know that you excluded those, if you included them which it looks like you did they had actually a positive effect on your efficiency ratio this particular quarter, so just those unusual items rolling off what actually round you from 60 up to 61. Just want to make sure that was - look at that right?", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, you're right, we didn't make an adjustment for these items, they weren\u2019t really very substantial, they weren\u2019t material enough, for example for us to go out and release an 8-K on them, but we just wanted to be very transparent with everybody on. Here is our core items, here is our non-core items you can choose to make whatever calculation you want, but we try to show you everything that was core and non-core so that you got a sense of what the real underlying earnings power of SunTrust is and how it can grow. And then you can make adjustments as you see fit we try to give you the adjustments we thought make sense.", "Marty Mosby", "No, I was just trying to highlight that that has a 1% rounding up so not really an operational or a pressure just you know as you move forward you don't have those unusual gains still left in the numbers. The other thing I want to ask you was if you look at the asset quality, the charge-offs and the back in the fourth quarter was the non-performers going up and then now you're charging of these energy loans.", "Your exposure looks on the surface to be better positioned, but it looks like you had a couple of larger loans that you were dealing with and have been dealing with through this process. Do you feel like you're getting through the process of dealing with those particular loans and that the underlying strength of the portfolio will eventually start to show through here?", "Aleem Gillani", "Thank you, Marty. That\u2019s a very insightful question on the bones of our portfolio and I think you nailed it. We had a couple of charge-offs in the energy book that perhaps raised our charge-off level a little bit higher this quarter. But when you peel it back you see energy charge-offs or you see our total charge-off level including energy only a 39 basis points deal within what we expect to achieve for a full-year guidance even including these couple of items.", "And ex-energy as I said we've got a charge-off level in the whole rest of the book up only 19 basis points. So, the rest of our book has a credit profile that frankly looks terrific. And as we work our way through the energy issues in the short-term. I think you'll see the power of the rest of the portfolio coming through relatively quickly.", "William Rogers", "Yes, Marty. I think rather than continuing to say we're pristine as it relates to the energy portfolio, we were very diligent and very focused and we've assembled a tight group focused on this portfolio because we really want to come out of this quarter saying that we\u2019ve crested that we've got most of this behind us from a charge-off standpoint as Aleem said I think we're clearly more than halfway through. And then that will have the positive impact on the provision going forward. So we put a lot of shoulder to the wheel on this quarter to be able to say we're crested.", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Burnell", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Aleem may be my first question is for you. You mentioned the pace of growth of the securities portfolio will continue to be upward and I notice the yield on the securities portfolio was down about 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. How much of a headwind is that given your outlook for lower margin in third quarter and further still in the fourth quarter?", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Matt. I think the effect of the securities portfolio is sort of two effects. One is growth in the book at lower coming on yield than the portfolio overall. And then second is the effect on mortgage back amortization. So the combined effects of both of those things in this last quarter was a round up basis point or so. The increase in MBS amortization. So it\u2019s about a basis point or so it may be - as we look forward it is already incorporated in our guidance, but think of it in the context of around a basis point a quarter.", "Matthew Burnell", "Okay. That's helpful. And then Bill maybe a question for you. You noted your very good CCAR or stress test results and the positive trend in capital returns. I'm curious as to how you and the Board potentially think about considering a mid cycle de minimus exception request to increase your capital returns over the course of the current capital cycle?", "William Rogers", "Just as a point of history, we've done in every opportunity. So that maybe I ought to give you a little perspective.", "Aleem Gillani", "Matt, we've done that each of the last two years.", "Matthew Burnell", "Right. Okay thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.", "Stephen Scouten", "Thanks. Good morning. Question for you guys, I guess first maybe to follow-up on some of the NIM questions. Anything that you guys can do assuming that maybe rates stay even lower for longer than we might have previously assumed, any additional strategies that you might pursue or implement moving forward to mitigate further compression here?", "Aleem Gillani", "I think one of the things that we're doing and you're seeing is our portfolio mix and over time what you're seeing is that we're growing our direct consumer lending portfolio at a very rapid pace, as I said 26%. And that's helping our overall portfolio mix and portfolio yield and that is indeed helping to mitigate the effect of NIM overall.", "The other thing that we're doing is we're very actively managing as I said to Matt just a minute ago, our securities book and our swaps book. And as we manage that over time that will also continue to I think help mitigate the effect of lower long-term rates on our book overall.", "William Rogers", "And then the portions that are dilutive to NIM, we're putting a lot of intensive pressure on relationship return and the good news is we've got the capacity and we've built the capability to be very demanding of our teams to get a lot of fee income and you're seeing that manifest itself in that fee income level. So if we're putting out capital that's dilutive to NIM, we expect to get return that's accretive to non-interest income.", "Stephen Scouten", "Yes. Okay. Makes sense. And then from a loan growth perspective, obviously after some intentional kind of run-off of some portfolios the last three quarters had just been I mean the growth been phenomenal. Is that at all a sustainable rate, I mean average loan growth call it 8% on average over the last three quarters? Is that in any way sustainable or should we see that come down somewhere 1.5 times kind of GDP growth rate like that?", "William Rogers", "As we said, I mean we really try not to manage to a loan growth numbers, so we look at production and then we look at pay downs and then we look at things that we may do to Aleem\u2019s point to continue to diversify the balance sheet and get us in a - get a positive position.", "Based on the things that we see now relative to all of those pluses and minuses that come in I mean 1% to 2% kind of range is probably not out of the realm of possibility, it\u2019s probably the right sort of zone, but again we don't manage that kind of number.", "I mean we really look at are we continuing to get positive production or we continuing to expand what we're doing with relationships and are they meeting all the hurdles. So we've got - for a loan to come on the book, it's got to get through a big gate in terms of overall hurdle rates.", "Aleem Gillani", "Steve to connect to your questions, we have the great flexibility here at SunTrust to be able to be opportunistic, we've been able to buy portfolios where we see the ability to connect those clients with the rest of our offerings and we have the ability to sell portfolios that we think are non-core or not going to be accretive to value over the long term.", "So we've got - as you said decent organic growth, we've got hardworking teammates, but in addition to that we've got great flexibility to be opportunistic to find ways to add value by both buying and selling portfolios.", "Stephen Scouten", "Great. Thanks guys. That\u2019s really helpful. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Nancy Bush of NAB Research. Your line is now open.", "Nancy Bush", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi, Nancy.", "Nancy Bush", "If I could just ask a question about the credit cycle sort of an overall question about it, you guys have made rather positive remarks here and as have a number of your regional and larger peers. Has there been a change in the outlook for the credit cycle right now? Because it looked like in the fourth and the first quarters, the commentary was a little bit more down beat and everybody seems to be looking at sort of a new improving credit cycle at this point. Is that a correct observation?", "William Rogers", "I wouldn't say that we've got sort of an improving credit cycle from here, Nancy. I think we're actually in a terrific part of the cycle overall and you can see that in our numbers and 19 basis points of net charge-offs ex-energy, spectacularly good.", "Aleem Gillani", "We do think, over the long-term over a cycle that with the credit profile that we've got we should be expecting net charge-offs of between 40 and 70.", "Nancy Bush", "Right.", "Aleem Gillani", "That's what's built into our strategic plans and that's what we've talked about is what you should expect over the medium-term. So we're in a very, very good part of the cycle, but to your point and I think this is where you're completely correct. This part has lasted a long time. We've been well under our 40 basis point expectation for many quarters and we continue to stay there. And when I take a look at the credit profile of the new loans that are coming on our books across all three segments, those credit profiles continue to be very, very strong.", "Consumer FICO\u2019s, consumer lending FICO\u2019s continue to come on at well north of 750 and in many cases we're talking about 770, 780. And as you know, we're not a sub-prime lender. So the credit profile of what we're putting on continues to be very strong like what we're seeing in wholesale banking and what's coming on there. So it is lasting longer than we had perhaps thought it would a couple of years ago.", "William Rogers", "Yes, that\u2019s what I was going to answer. I think it's really no change in intensity is just change in time and every quarter it continues to be good, everyone will talk about - that's a quarter more in the cycle.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. And if I could just ask as an add on, the OCC has warned about CRE conditions in some markets. I know you guys are not - no longer in OCC Bank, but that's a regulatory warning. I think that sort of cuts across regulatory agencies? Are you backing out of any markets right now or downplaying any markets that you're concerned about CRE?", "William Rogers", "Well, I say it's not just a market specific kind of comment, but it certainly is a market and product specific comment. So absolutely there are places where we have less intensity related to a product that might be overbuilt in a certain market and we're seeing pockets of that. As I said earlier, I mean our production in CRE will go down now the things that we are doing and the things that we see I mean are positive, but it is not an overall health kind of metric. It's that proverbial heat map.", "And Nancy you know as well I mean the way that we're organized now allows us to really manage that heat map so much better than the way we organized before. So we can really holdback one market and one product and emphasize another product in another market relative to the help of those clients, the support of those clients and what might be going on in any particular area.", "Nancy Bush", "Yes. Could you just speak to that heat map in Florida if you would?", "William Rogers", "Yes. It's interesting because there is a lot of the parts of Florida continue to be really good. We've not been a big player in the condo market in Miami all the way through and we continue not to be a big player. Multifamily there were so to keep an eye on that would be a good example.", "The other markets in Florida from an industrial standpoint are much better. Job creation in Florida, remember Florida is one of the top job creating states in the country. The port business in Florida is good. We see a lot of the east coast - the west coast to east coast migration happening and the building that goes along with all the increased ford activity in Florida.", "So there are a couple of pockets that would be a good example and then maybe talk about sort of housing in general. We keep a close eye on housing in general overall in Florida. As you might imagine, we have probably the most heightened sensitivity of that of anybody.", "And we continue to be with really good developers. We continue to see pockets of opportunity. There's not a lot of crazy stuff going on. There's not a lot of land accumulation. There is not a lot of two guys in a truck. All the things that we got worried about, but relative exposure is well managed within that geography.", "Nancy Bush", "Thank you very much.", "Aleem Gillani", "Nancy, would you step back and look at our CRE book overall. It's very well diversified by geography and asset class. And as you know, we've got zero delinquencies in our CRE book today and a criticized loan exposure level of only about 2%.", "Nancy Bush", "Okay. Great. Thank you very much.", "William Rogers", "Christine, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Last question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Line is now open.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "William Rogers", "Good morning.", "Aleem Gillani", "Good morning, Gerard.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Coming back to your capital, you guys are obviously very well capitalized, Aleem you pointed to the success that you had during CCAR is being one of the lowest reductions in your CET1 ratio. I think you came in over 7% with the bogey being 4.5%. You also pointed out that acquisitions are really not what you're interested in doing at this time.", "So the question is your CET1 ratio of 9.7%, do you consider that to be too high and if it is too high would you - the change that we expect in next year's CCAR of not having the qualitative part of the test being applicable to Banks with under $250 billion in assets? Is than an opportunity for SunTrust to really give back much more in a one-time kind of special dividend or buyback to bring those capital levels down to drive the profitability higher?", "Aleem Gillani", "Well Gerard, I think our view is indeed similar to the one you just espoused at 9.7%. That is more capital than we need to fundamentally run the operations of this Company and it is more capital and we need when you look at the very strong risk profile across all of our books. What you have seen with us is that we have been looking for ways and finding ways to allow that ratio to drift down a little bit, the increase in dividend, the increase in buyback.", "What you should see with us over time is that that 9.7 should continue to drift down a little bit attempt here, attempt there and come down to something but over time I wouldn't say, I wouldn\u2019t expect a one-time massive repayment but that over time we'd be able to bring it to something that is value added for all of our shareholders rather than retaining as much excess as we have today.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Okay. And would you guys could consider the CCAR capital requirements you\u2019re binding constraint on capital?", "Aleem Gillani", "It has been until now and as we look at what next year brings to CCAR once we get some clarity on what the rules are going to look like for Banks in our position. We'll evaluate whether that continues to be so.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Great. And then just as a follow-up on the quality of the commercial real estate book that you guys have pointed out in the underwriting part of the cycle? Can you give us some color obviously you've been through cycles? Why this is one so far been so much better in terms of lasting longer was that the severity of the downturn that\u2019s still fresh in all of our minds or why is that so good for so long?", "William Rogers", "I think there are a couple of reasons one is I think as an industry we\u2019ve been more demanding on structure so there's just a lot more equity in this part of the cycle, they are bigger players in this part of the cycle. I think particularly about the single family part you know it's dominated now by bigger players, lot more capital and lot more staying power.", "There\u2019s been a lot of equity available, they're accepting returns that are perhaps lower so that allows them to have more equity in the deals. So I just think there is been a - we tend to have short memories and I think maybe in the case of commercial real estate our memories are little longer this cycle than it has been in the past. But it\u2019s something in fairness for all of us to be watching.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Sure. Bill, Aleem thank you so much.", "William Rogers", "Thanks.", "Ankur Vyas", "Okay, Christine. This concludes our call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations department. Thank you.", "Operator", "And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}

I will conclude with some perspectives on how our performance aligns well with our investment thesis.", "So, before I get into the details of the financial performance of the company, I want to give thanks to our teammates, for the tremendous effort they put forth to help clients, communities and fellow teammates who were impacted by the hurricanes. ", "For those of you that know us well, you know we\u2019re a purpose driven organization, and the way our teammates responded in the wake of these catastrophic storms truly demonstrated our purpose and action. Teammates across the company went above and beyond the call of duty working overtime, deploy mobile ATMs, delivery needed supplies and donations, and even many rescue boats to ensure that we helped our clients maintain financial confidence during these challenging times. So, despite the stress circumstances, it was a proud moment for me as the leader of this great team. ", "Now, let me get into some specifics of the quarter. This quarter earnings per share were $1.06, up 16% year-over-year, this performance is driven by consistent execution against our strategy and investment thesis. We delivered solid revenue growth, particularly in areas where we have a demonstrated competitive advantage, we improved our efficiency and lastly our strong capital position is allowing us to reduce our share count. ", "We delivered this overall performance, even after accounting for hurricane related reserve bills. Across all fronts, whether its revenue growth, profitability or credit, we had a strong quarter. ", "While on the surface, loan growth is lower there was a lot of positive movement that\u2019s happening underneath. With C&I much of the elevated paydowns are from clients we felt to access to capital markets, where returns quite frankly don\u2019t meet our hurdles. Therefore, we have improved the ROE profile of the company and freed up capital for other client business, or to return to our shareholders and that\u2019s a tradeoff we\u2019re comfortable making. ", "And consumer we are still seeing good growth across all fronts, in fact this quarter was a record for life stream originations. This is furthering the positive mix shift within the loan portfolio, contributing to our NIM expansion and helping us grow net interest income which was up $28 million sequentially. ", "Within non-interest income, capital market continues to perform at very high levels. Investment banking income is up a meaningful 29% year-to-date and it's clear that the value proposition we provide to our wholesale clients remains highly differentiated in the marketplace. ", "Net net revenues are up 2% sequentially and 4% year-over-year, the latter of which was achieved despite a nearly 50% decline in mortgage production income, which is a real testament to the improved diversity of the franchise. ", "I am also pleased with the efficiency progress we continue to make. As you\u2019ll remember I indicated earlier this year that our efficiency performance needed to improve. We have made good progress since then and we are creating even more momentum across the company to achieve further efficiencies. This includes the actions we took this quarter to accelerate our progress, both to ensure that we are able to deliver on our commitments to our owners and create capacity for future investment and growth. ", "Asset quality and consistent underwriting and return discipline continue to be key areas of strength for the company. This perspective is also shared by S&P who upgraded our credit ratings outlook to positive in September. We did have an elevated provision expense this quarter to provide for anticipated losses from the hurricanes. But these losses are very manageable in the context of the overall company particularly given the strength and diversity of the loan portfolio. ", "And finally, we commenced our 2017 capital plan this quarter which means each order not only gains incremental ownership from the company as a result of our 38% increase in share repurchases, but they also benefit from a 54% increase in cash dividends. ", "So big picture, I\u2019m pleased with how the year is progressing. Our consistent strategic focus keeps us on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of EPS growth, efficiency improvements and higher capital returns to shareholders. Our ROE profile also continues to improve a reflection of improved efficiency, disciplined balance sheet management and strong credit quality. ", "So, with that as a short overview, I\u2019ll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more specifics on the quarter.", "Aleem Gillani", "Hi, thank you Bill. Good morning everybody, thank you for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll begin on slide 4. Our net interest margin improved one basis point this quarter which helped to drive the $28 million increase in net interest income. As anticipated, deposits betas did increase but much of the sequential change was due to a one time reprising of certain suite deposits and brokerage accounts in late June. Therefore, while betas will likely continue to nudge upward overtime, the slope of increase will not match this quarter\u2019s level. ", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect the net interest margin to decline by one to three basis points. This is consistent with our view that NIM grind down in quarters without a rate hike given lagging deposit costs and sprint compression in the C&I book, which is partially offset by continued positive mix shift in the overall portfolio. Beyond that, NIM trends will depend on the rate environment and we expect some NIM expansion as the short-end of the curve continues to rise. ", "Moving to slide 5, you will see that non-interest income increased by $19 million sequentially primarily driven by our continued success in meeting the capital markets needs of more clients across the entire wholesale platform. This quarter specifically, capital markets related income increased to $24 million sequentially largely due to M&A and equity which both had record quarters, a great sign of SunTrust\u2019s increasing strategic relevance with our clients. ", "Across the capital markets platform, we\u2019re encouraged not only by our current success, but also by the significant growth opportunities that remain as we leverage our competitive advantage to expand and deepen relationships with our investment banking, commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth clients. ", "Mortgage related income was also up by $7 million sequentially as a result of improved gain on sale margins. These gains were partially offset by lower commercial real estate related income given slower levels of activity. But we do expect that to rebound in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s move on to expenses on slide 6.", "Expenses were stable relative to the prior quarter and as Bill mentioned, we did have some discrete items. First, several legacy legal matters were resolved in the third quarter, which totaled up to $58 million of legal accrual reversals. These benefits were largely absorbed by several discrete charges, including an elevated severance accrual. ", "In addition, we also wrote down certain software related assets, as we accelerate technology enabled efficiency initiatives, particularly our transition to the cloud. Our strong overall business performance also resulted in increased incentive compensation expense this quarter. ", "Compared to the prior year, expenses declined by $18 million, due to improved expense discipline and ongoing efficiency initiatives. In particular outside processing and software declined by $22 million, partially as a result of increased focus on third-party costs. ", "As you will see on slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 59.2%. This includes the net result of discrete benefits and charges recognized in the quarter and I am pleased to note that our core efficiency as a company continues to improve. Clearly the efficiency initiatives we have been executing against for many years, are driving positive operating leverage and there is still more progress to be made. ", "Across the company we are demonstrating heightened focused and vigor around reducing less productive expenses to provide funding for investments in talent, technology and improved product offerings, while also achieving our goal of a sub 60% tangible efficiency ratio by 2019. ", "Moving to slide eight. Our asset quality metrics remain strong, evidenced by only 21 basis points of net charge-offs and 48 basis points of non-performing loans. These low levels reflect the relative strength we are seeing across our entire portfolio. ", "The ALLL ratio increased by 3 basis points this quarter, as a result of anticipated losses from the recent hurricanes. As it relates to hurricane impacts, there will be a modest uptick in NPLs and charge-offs over the next several quarters, primarily driven by consumer and residential loans. In advance of that, this expectation is incorporated into this quarter's allowance bill. ", "Overall, we still expect to operate within a 25 basis points to 35 basis points net charge off ratio over the near term, and also continue to forecast the provision level that should roughly approximate net charge-offs. ", "Let\u2019s take a look at the balance sheet on slide nine. Average loans were stable sequentially, as growth in consumer lending offset declines in C&I. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew 2%, with broad based growth across most consumer lending products. ", "As Bill mentioned earlier, C&I loan balances have been declining, as solid core production is being masked by lower revolver utilization and elevated paydowns. Conversely, we are benefiting from this to some extent, within the capital market business, a good representation of our broad and diverse capabilities. That being said, we are having good dialogue with our clients, as clarity on various policy front develops, we believe our clients will be ready to invest and we are well positioned to meet their needs, whether buy a lending, capital markets or other solutions.", "Turning to deposits, average client deposits were stable sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year, with growth across most products and both segments. Period imbalances were up 2%, largely due to temporary corporate deposits. Consistent with our commentary in July, the strong deposit growth we've produced over the past several years, in addition to our access to low cost funding, enables us to prudently manage our funding base, and therefore more effectively managed our overall deposit beta. Our goal continues to be to maximize our value proposition outside of [repeat], by meeting more of our clients' needs, via strategic investments in talent and technology.", "Slide 11 provides an update to our capital position. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phase-in basis was 9.5%, stable with the prior quarter, even after we commenced our 2017 capital plan, which provided for 54% increase in the dividend and a 38% increase in share repurchases.", "As a reminder, we issued $750 million of preferred stock in May, and we may look to take advantage of strong market conditions to further optimize our capital stack over the coming quarters. Also, late in the third quarter, the Federal Reserve released the notice of proposed rulemaking, tailored towards simplifying capital rules for regional banks like SunTrust. While we do not currently expect the changes to materially impact our fully phased-in capital ratios, the rules combined with recent legislative proposals in the house incentive, are commendable steps towards tailoring regulation to the actual risk profile and complexity of regulated banks. Efforts we strongly encourage, given our simple and domestic business model.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the segment reviews, beginning with Consumer on slide 12, where we continued to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum. Our 2% sequential revenue growth was largely driven by net interest income, which was up 3% and 8% year-over-year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, in addition to continued improvements in loan mix.", "Our targeted investment in consumer lending are consistently yielding good results, and offsetting the declines in home equity balances, evidenced by the 2% sequential and 4% year-over-year increase in average loans.", "Non-interest income was down 15% year-over-year, largely due to the lower mortgage related income, given the elevated refinancing activity we saw last year. But more recently mortgage related income has begun to stabilized, which drove the 2% sequential increase in non-interest income. Within [indiscernible] particularly, we\u2019re pleased with the improved momentum we have developed as well as management related revenues beginning to stabilized and to grow slightly. This is a reflection of our client first focus and continued improvement in capabilities, resulting in our ability to attract and retaining top talent and grow AUM. More specifically in the past few months, we've hired teams in New York and Texas, which contributes further to our ability to grow AUM and expands our geographic reach. ", "Provision expense did increase on a sequential and year-over-year basis largely due to the reserve build associated with hurricanes in addition to strong loan growth. The hurricanes will also modestly pressure revenue in the coming quarters given relief we\u2019re providing for certain clients by waiving fees and providing payment forbearance consistent with our purpose oriented culture. ", "This increase in provision was largely offset by the legal accrual reversals which was the primary driver of the decline in expenses. Overall, we\u2019re making progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the consumer segment evidence in part by continued growth in mobile engagement and usage and the 7% year-over-year reduction in branch cut.", "Our ongoing process of integrating mortgage into consumer will also yield further results. By bringing all consumer products and services under one segment, we will be able to create an enhanced client centric approach resulting in a more efficient, effective and improved client experience. ", "Moving on to wholesale, we delivered record quarterly revenue and net income in part due to strong markets conditions and a benign credit environment but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we\u2019re having with our clients. Quarterly revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time and was up 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, primarily due to the combined strength of investment banking and trading. ", "Growth in investment banking was broad based across most products and client segments. More specifically, M&A and equity two businesses which have been key areas of investment for us each have a record quarter. As we continue to become a more relevant strategic advisor to our clients, we\u2019re not only growing these two advisory businesses at a faster pace than the traditional debt businesses, we\u2019re also increasing our average fee per transaction and reducing our reliance on providing balance sheet, thereby improving our return on equity. In fact, CIB\u2019s ROE in the third quarter was 13.5%. ", "Net interest income was also a key contributor to the strong revenue growth, up 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, as a result of improved loan yields and continued discipline on overall returns. Despite record revenue, non-interest expense was stable sequentially and up 8% compared to the prior year as a result of higher compensation tied to strong revenue growth, the acquisition of Pillar and ongoing investments in technology. ", "Specifically, our new loan origination platform is now fully deployed to commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth management with deployments to CIB scheduled in early 2018. We also continue to roll out our new treasury and payments platform [indiscernible] to more clients. As a reminder, we announced the sale of our insurance premium finance business back in September and the transaction is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter.", "This is a solid performing business but does not fit with our broader wholesale banking strategy and capabilities. And we'll provide details on the financial impact after the transaction closes. But we do not expect it to be material to SunTrust\u2019s overall financial performance and trajectory. ", "In conclusion, while market conditions can drive quarterly variability, our differentiated business model and wholesale banking continues to deliver strong results and we expect to see further growth in 2018, particularly if economic growth accelerates and we gain greater clarity around tax refund. ", "Additionally, as you may have seen, we have recently announced an expansion of the commercial banking business in to new markets in Ohio and Texas. Given the success that we have had in wholesale, our commercial banking business is following our investment banking and corporate banking businesses into new and high growth markets. ", "Now let me turn the call back over to Bill. ", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks, Aleem. So, to conclude, I\u2019ll forward to slide 14, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis, but more notably also highlights the further opportunity we have across each of these fronts. So first, while the hurricanes did result in an incremental provision impact this quarter, the work that we have done over the past several years to diversify our loan portfolio both by geography and loan type, significantly mitigated the potential risk from Harvey and Irma.", "Not only do we benefit from a diverse loan portfolio, but we also have a diverse business mix, which has allowed us to grow revenues despite the significant declines in mortgage production volumes thereby reducing overall earnings volatility. ", "Second, I remain confident in our growth outlook and opportunities set. We continue to focus on growing and supporting our key areas of differentiation and this has proven to be highly effective. A little more specifically, investment banking has delivered nearly as much revenue in the first nine months of this year as we did in all of 2016, and further as Aleem mentioned, M&A and equity are performing very well, which I think is a real testament to our increasing strategic relevance with our clients. ", "The investments we have made in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are providing excellent experience for our clients in addition to consistent and profitable growth. ", "Furthermore, we have made and continue to make, meaningful investments in technology to modernize our infrastructure and deliver differentiated experiences which embody our purpose, meet evolving client needs and position us for growth. In the third quarter specifically, we added new capabilities for our mobile and online platforms which reduced manual data entry for our clients and improves their overall experience. ", "Mobile deposits and sign-ons are up 20% year-over-year and in the third quarter more than a quarter of our consumer sales occurred via digital channel. Additionally, we are testing and highlight robotic process automation in certain parts of the company and we are expanding our cloud capabilities. Each of these investments will improve the client experience, help us become more efficient and increase our flexibility and speed to market. ", "Third, in order to ensure we have adequate capacity to make future investments and growth in technology, we just remain highly focused on improving the efficiency of the company. As Aleem mentioned, we have a number of initiatives in place to help us become even more efficient, some of these are continuation of long-term strategies, while others are an acceleration which require heightened focus in order to achieve our sub-60% target in 2019. ", "In addition to improving our efficiency, we also continue to demonstrate a focus on returns, we\u2019re making good progress here as evidenced by 12.5% ROTCE over the last two quarters. ", "And lastly our capital position remains strong with common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.5%. This is even more notable when juxtaposed against our risk profile, where SunTrust consistently demonstrates among the lowest levels of capital erosion in stress test relative to peer banks. The strong risk adjusted capital position afforded us the opportunity to purchase $330 million of common shares in the third quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 54%. ", "While I'm proud of the strong financial performance that we've delivered, I'm equally pleased with the progress in how we delivered against our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being, and helping more Americans achieve financial confidence. At SunTrust, teammates know purpose and performance are inextricably linked, specifically last quarter we announced the launch of Momentum onUp, which is not-for-profit program that aims to help our corporate and commercial clients equip their employees with the tools they need for financial success. Today we have more than 50 companies enrolled in Momentum onUp and a significant pipeline as our clients realize the link between financial well-being and satisfaction of their employees.", "This quarter we also participated in the grand opening of the new Crosstown Concourse in Memphis, a former Seers building turned into a new mixed used development that includes an innovative financial confidence center, where we have staff professionals who provide financial literacy and information in classes to the community. Crosstown is just a great example of how our capabilities and our purpose oriented culture can bring new life and economic growth to the communities we serve.", "Overall 2017 is progressing very well and my confidence in all of our teammates to fulfill our purpose and deliver strong financial performance continues to be very high.", "Now with that Ankur, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.", "Ankur Vyas", "Great. Thanks, Bill. Cinthia, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that I\u2019d like to ask the participants, please limit yourself to one primary question, and one follow-up. So that we can accommodate as many as possible today.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Matt O'Connor", "I was hoping, you could elaborate a bit on the NIM trending down during quarters where rates aren\u2019t going up, just little bit more in terms of what\u2019s driving that on the funding side? And then kind of tying it together with the balance sheet growth, are you still hopeful that you can grow net interest income dollars, I just [indiscernible] but then just conceptually during quarters where there aren\u2019t rate increases. are you hoping that you can still grow the revenue dollars?", "Bill Rogers", "Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So normally what happens in terms of NIM and in quarters without a rate hike. Partially, this is the roll on roll off effect for C&I. In C&I production yields are still a little bit lower than portfolio yields. So as all loans are often new loans come on, there is a little bit of downward pressure on them. ", "And then secondly, remember that deposit rates will continue to creep up a little bit in quarters without a rate hike. So just by the beta -- by the mass effect on beta that\u2019s going to be a little bit of downward pressure on NIM in quarters without a rate hike. But relative to your point about NII, is in general yes. You know overtime, take a look at our last several quarters and you see NII climbing and I think if I look out at the longer term absolutely, I think NII is going to climb both a combination of balance sheet growth and NIM expansion. In any one quarter, maybe yes maybe no. If I look at Q4, you know a little bit of balance sheet growth with a little bit of NIM pressure, that could go either way. I am thinking the NII might be generally flattish in Q4 but if I look out into \u201918 NIM expansion plus loan growth absolutely NII is going to go up I think next year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open. ", "John McDonald ", "Okay, good morning. I wanted to just follow up on the two questions Matt just ask Aleem just on next quarter\u2019s NIM guidance, what\u2019s the deposit beta assumption you\u2019re kind of incorporating into that?", "Aleem Gillani ", "We\u2019re thinking something in the mid-20s John. If I look at our cumulative beta over the last couple of years just on interest bearing deposits, its 17% and we think it is going to continue to nudge up a little bit over time. So not sure exactly where it's going to be but we\u2019re modeling something into the 20s now.", "John McDonald ", "Okay, and then on the balance sheet growth Bill maybe just kind of get your broader thoughts of how you\u2019re sizing up the opportunities and headwinds on loan growth, both on the commercial and the consumer side?", "Bill Rogers", "Yeah, sure. Let me sort of break that out as you\u2019ve suggested and maybe extrapolate a little bit. You know on the consumer side, we\u2019re pleased with the investments we\u2019ve made and the results we\u2019re seeing and it is up 4% sequentially, 4% year-over-year. We see things like a LightStream where as we noted had a really good production quarter and continues to be a on a good track and obviously up year-over-year in terms of production. ", "Credit card balance\u2019s growth is really positive and we\u2019re seeing that. Home equity is still good from a production standpoint but I would say we\u2019re several quarters away from an inflection point there from a growth standpoint. So, on the consumer side, we\u2019re really growing where we want to and the areas that we are growing are accretive to return. ", "And the wholesale is a little bit different story and you\u2019ve got to break it down. I think we\u2019ve talked about it before, I look at sort of four variables, I look at production, paydown, utilization and pipelines. And all four of those to think about the wholesale balance sheet portfolio. ", "On the production side, we did actually have an increase in the third quarter in production but it's still a little bit off the seven-quarter average. Payoffs are still elevated so we continue to see that and they\u2019re 14% to 15% ahead of the seven-quarter average. But on the payout side, sort of two things related to that, one is as Aleem mentioned, we\u2019ve never been better positioned to take advantage of that in terms of capital markets access, some of the M&A activity that we\u2019re involved in is causing the paydowns, the advent of our syndication capabilities, so we're benefiting on the advice side of the paydowns. ", "And then as you know we are also selective, we have got an intense focus on returns and as I mentioned when we are not involved in something, we get a chance to redeploy those assets under something the either has a higher return or return it. ", "And then utilization, and utilization did drop-off and particularly in CIB, dropped off about 9 basis points that for us equates to about $0.5 billion in outstanding. So, interesting enough, this quarter's production outpaced payoffs, so that was a little bit of a change and virtually all that decline was in utilization. ", "And then the final component is pipelines, so how do we feel about the future, CRE is a little bit down, that wouldn\u2019t be a surprise that sort of market conditions, as well as maybe some selectivity on our part, but CIB in the last 90 days is up and commercial had some of its highest levels of pipelines in the last year. ", "So that sort of put that all in a big mix and served around, I\u2019d say we\u2019re growing where we want to, we\u2019re benefiting from the things that we can\u2019t control, like capital markets access. We have maintained our return discipline which is important, and sort of our overall health metrics if you include those things like pipelines are pretty solid. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Ken Usdin", "Thanks, good morning guys. On the other side of the corporate side, you obviously had a really strong investment banking result and I just wanted to ask, how much of the kind of the hurt on the commercial loan side, are you seeing show up in the investment banking business, and if you could also just give us your general thoughts on how the pipelines look in that business going forward? Thanks. ", "Bill Rogers", "It's hard to calculate an exact sort of [our score] to that, but I would say overall its benefited, I mean we can look at the [advice] business that we have been in and the components and the things that drives that income. The momentum in that business is very good, if I look at -- you look over the last since 2010, we have had sort of 10% CAGR most recently, 2014 forward, closer to 16% CAGR. The metrics that we look at, average fee size up significantly, the number of left leads up significantly, really good fundamentals, deep expertise, really good consistency and quality of our talent there, diverse platform more than 40% of the revenue was from M&A equity offerings and equity sales and trading, we\u2019re penetrating the commercial market, that\u2019s up, so we have more runway there, so I am feeling good about the momentum in the business quarter-to-quarter. ", "As you know they can have lot of variabilities, I think we have got good momentum headed into the fourth quarter, but maybe more importantly really good momentum headed into the next several years. ", "Ken Usdin", "Appreciate that. And one quick follow up on the CRE business. We see in the press release that Pillar was lower but also looks like the other sides were lower, can you just help us understand that commercial real estate business and kind of the moving parts of what your confidence is, that\u2019s going to get after a couple tougher quarters?", "Bill Rogers", "Yeah, there are number of things in their Pillar included SunTrust Community Capital and number of things in there. I would say, in the third quarter, we were not as excited as we want to be, but the fourth quarter is going to be better in that business. It tends to have a fourth quarter seasonality to it. So, we can already sort of see that manifesting itself. What I would say is it relates to pillar is, what I\u2019m really excited about is just the whole -- once we go to market with our commercial real estate, I mean the kind of add backs we\u2019re getting with clients where we are having sort of that mutual introduction where, we\u2019re bringing essentially bridge financing to Pillar, and Pillar is bringing essentially distribution to the commercial real estate side. There might be a little bit of an overhang and fairness on affordable housing as it relates to tax reform and some uncertainty about the tax element of that. But on the other side, we\u2019re just got approved to do some senior housing loans in Pillar. So that really helps our ageing services. So, I still feel really good about it. Again, third quarter is probably a little disappointing in one sense, but in terms of the potential and the opportunity and long-term perspective I'll probably feel better about it now than when we got started.", "Aleem Gillani ", "Ken, as you know, there is a little bit of seasonality in that business and Q4 is normally a little bit better. So, we are optimistic that Q4 will be better than Q3.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Betsy Graseck", "Could we talk a little bit about the efficiency side? You dropped the efficiency ratio quite nicely this quarter, and I just wanted to understand the past, both in the commercial part of the business as well as consumer given some of the investments you\u2019ve been making to drive down the expenses?", "Aleem Gillani ", "Well for efficiency, overall you know where we are headed. The targets that we\u2019ve set for ourselves and we\u2019re working towards those and we\u2019re working towards those and making investments in both areas, as you said consumer and commercial. I guess first of all, in technology, we\u2019re making investments in consumer technology and you\u2019re going to see some of those actually show up this quarter in the payment space in consumer with the introduction of a new consumer payment product, and in commercial, some of the investments we\u2019ve made have actually just shown up in treasury and payment solutions with the introduction of SunView which we\u2019re rolling out across our commercial client base in several ways, some of which have already been implemented and some of which go into Q4 and Q1. So those are a couple of examples of investments that we\u2019ve made in technology in each one of those spaces in which we\u2019ll continue to improve efficiency. ", "I think in other areas Betsy you know that the severance chart that we took in the third quarter, we continue to take a look at it as you would expect, add our total amount of overall business, how our clients are reacting, what it is that they expect from us, and how we respond to that across all kinds of distribution channels, including the human one, and as we think about sort of overall skillsets needed and total amount of team in responding to clients in each of those spaces, we continue to make improvements in structuring the efficiency of each of our businesses from both a front and back office perspective. So, all of that is underway now. ", "Betsy Graseck", "And the guidance of below 60 in 2019 I mean it seems like you might be on path to hitting them a little bit sooner on an annual basis from what you delivered this quarter or is there something unique in this quarter in the form of maybe high investment banking fees that would keep us going out maybe a slower run rate than you got this quarter.", "Bill Rogers", "The part that we want to calibrate related to the efficiency ratio and Aleem pointed out you know things on both sides. I mean we have a lot of things to become more efficient but we also want to make sure that we create capacity to continue invest in growth. So similarly, we see just a lot of opportunities also on things that you can see them all across the performance here of things that we think are doing well. I mean we don\u2019t want to not make sure that we\u2019re investing in those businesses and those opportunities. So, this as we said earlier in the year that the latter two quarters would be lower efficiency ratio of quarters because the first two were higher efficiency ratio of quarters and we\u2019re careful about this is not a quarter-over-quarter sort of process. We look at this on an annual basis and we\u2019ll continue to do that, I think next year we\u2019ll say that [indiscernible] ratio will be lower than it was this year and will be on path to being sub-60 with balancing all those things related to achieving the maximum amount of efficiency we can and making sure that we\u2019re investing on our businesses for growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is open. ", "Marty Mosby", "Thanks. Aleem I wanted to drill down into your discussion about the grind down of the margin given some repricing in the more longer-term portfolios. If I looked across the yields, in CRE and mortgage and the securities portfolio, there each of those kind of fixed rate portfolios are rounding up from second to third quarter. So, I mean you're still continuing to see some positive in those. So where is the actual pressure point in a sense of what you\u2019re talking about for the pressure on the margin going into the fourth quarter?", "Aleem Gillani ", "Great, thanks Marty. Absolutely between the second and the third quarter you did see a move up in all of those spaces which we expected coming into this quarter given that we\u2019ve got a rate hike in June. So as a result of that rate hike, we were expecting our overall NIM to climb just a little bit this quarter as it did. But in quarters without a rate hike, those are the quarters where we\u2019re looking for NIM to probably grind down a little bit and again not substantially, we\u2019re thinking one to three basis points but we\u2019re grinding down primarily on the asset side is the lone turnover in C&I and where cost is a little bit on the liability side is a little bit of that normal delay you get in deposit repricing in quarters without a rate hike and that\u2019s just from a maths perspective results in a little bit of beta and a little bit of downward pressure on that.", "Marty Mosby", "The other piece I was looking at was if you looked at the provisioning, even taking out the 30 million from hurricane, consumer has been moving higher and your wholesale has been offsetting that, so it's kind of kept your provisioning in total relatively flat but we\u2019re seeing more you know I don\u2019t see much more improvement in the wholesale that\u2019s available and you are really been growing the consumer portfolio pretty strongly. So, didn\u2019t also was losses already related or are you providing for expected losses in the future for consumer, but how should we expect those two things to kind of keep balancing out going forward?", "Bill Rogers", "There is a little bit of a mix effect there, you are right. But in general, here is the way I would think about it, in general provision will approximate charge-offs, so not to lock in on one quarter here, because I don\u2019t intend us to be a one quarter point, but this quarter we had $78 million in charge-offs, 21 basis points and so in general the provision is going to approximate that, that would have been about our provision this quarter, ex the effect of the hurricane. ", "That going forward, there is a little bit of a mix effect, as we grow consumer banking, as we grow our consumer lending business and there may be slightly higher charge-offs coming out of that business overtime, but we are paying -- we are getting paid for that in terms of higher yields. So, the bottom line effective this is good, even though when you look at that one line, you might see slightly higher charge-offs overtime. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "On the loan growth topic, I appreciate the color you gave us in terms of the pipeline and utilization all that, what does that interpret into loan growth expectation for the quarter, next quarter is it likely to be at this low single digit level again and how does that play into your expectation for 2018, just given the macro backdrop? Thanks. ", "Bill Rogers", "I don\u2019t think loan growth is going to break out in any one quarter, I mean where the momentum is, so the fourth quarter could be a little bit better than the third quarter, we sort of have to see where things go from that standpoint and as it relates to the long-term, as I said I mean the health metrics that I look at in terms of the pipelines and the performance and the discipline that we have in the system, I think we\u2019ll have to see for 2018. I do fundamentally believe that there are commerce on the sidelines, our clients are healthy, they have got opportunity, I think we have to put variables in their light tax reform and others issues that could be propel us for loan growth in 2018. ", "So, we don\u2019t, as you know I mean John, we never guide the loan growth, we look at the health metrics and we look at are we doing the right things for clients and are we achieving the right kind of returns and loan growth is really an outcome of those things and output of those things rather than supplement that we start with as a metric and work backwards from. ", "John Pancari", "Okay, alright, appreciate that. Back to the credit side, on slide 18, just looking at that delinquencies were up, the 39-day delinquencies were up notably in auto and card on a linked quarter basis. Is that primarily hurricane related, and if not is there any other driver there that you are starting to see? Thanks. ", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, some of that is hurricane related, right, towards the end of the quarter, but these are early delinquencies and so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect that all of these are going to turn into non-performing loans. ", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. Lastly, just wondering if I could on the expense side, I know you\u2019re talking about the franchise and you're still looking at the overall system. What is your expectation again for branch consolidation for the coming quarters? Thanks.", "Bill Rogers", "Yeah. We\u2019ve done about 7% this year and we will do a little more, we'll start close to sort of the 7.5 kind of range, but remember that sort of net in terms of branch production. So, we\u2019re also opening branches and we\u2019re also renovating and refurbishing branches. And as you know, I think we were an early mover in terms of branch consolidation, which had to do with a lot of factors, not the least of which is the construct of our branch network, which is then faster growing urban market. So that afforded us an opportunity to consolidate faster. And also, the fact that we have in-store and traditional locations. So, we have a lot of different, different, different variables. And we also had a number of branches on the leases. So, we had some advantages I think which allowed us to sort of get started early on this process, and we're now down well north of 20% in terms of branch reductions.", "Now going forward a lot of that will be predicated as it was before on client behavior, I would see certainly -- I don't think we'll be at the same pace in 2018 and 2019 that we were in 2017. We probably be more of a steady state somewhere in the 3% kind of range, but in fairness, we'll look at our -- we\u2019re going to follow clients and the investments that we've made in digital, their adoption, particularly our clients, their adoption of those investments, we\u2019ll predicate to where we go, and the same opportunities that we had in the past, we have in the future, I mean we've got a branch network that really lends itself to optimization.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.", "Geoffrey Elliot", "Hello. Good morning. Thank you, sir for taking the question, staying with expenses, on the charges you took this quarter, what sort of earn back do you expect on those, how long is it going to take you to earn back the charges that you took?", "Bill Rogers", "Thanks, Geoffrey. That\u2019s a good question. Two types of charges there. If you think about the severance component of that charge, the earn back on that typically is four to six quarters. So, it\u2019s relatively quick. And on the technology related charge, so little bit longer, think about that one in terms of kind of six to eight quarters.", "Geoffrey Elliot", "Okay. Thanks. And then on the 60% target, the tangible efficiency, you said that at a long-time ago when I guess 60% was a long way below the efficiency ratio, you\u2019re running out modestly stretched to some people back then. How do you think about whether it makes sense to come out with a lower number, now that you are kind of closing on the 60%, there\u2019s going to be some courses where you are below, and some courses where you\u2019re above? Does it make sense to give us a lower number and kind of communicate the longer-term aspiration?", "Bill Rogers", "Yeah. Thanks, Geoffrey. You\u2019re right. We did communicate that a number below 60%. Actually, back in 2011, when our efficiency ratio at the time was 72%. So, when it was 72% we said we needed to get to below 60% and that's where we thought we could run the company. Over the course of the last several years, as we become more efficient I think we\u2019re learning more about what the potential is, what the opportunity is and to your point I think it is going to continue to get better. ", "So, the first thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to achieve that below 60. We\u2019re going to get those companies to an efficiency ratio that starts with a five, for a full year and when we achieve that target we\u2019re not going to stop. We have a culture now of continuous improvement. Our team may think about efficiency, they think about return every day and everything that they do and we will be looking at what is our opportunity, where should we be running this company and let\u2019s achieve that target and then you can expect we will be setting a new challenge for ourselves. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Erika Najarian", "I just had one follow-up question and thank you so much for all the responses on the efficiency front. Aleem, as we think about future rate hikes in 2018, balancing your commentary on future betas, how should we think about the value to the NIM of every 25 basis points of rate hike from here?", "Aleem Gillani ", "Yeah, typically I would think about that as generally on the order of three basis points in that first quarter after a rate hike depending of course on when the rate hike is in the quarter and what we are thinking of Erica in terms of a number of rate hikes for 2018 or let\u2019s say between now and the end of \u201918 as we\u2019re thinking there is probably going to be two. So, over the course of the next 15 months, as we put together our plan right now for 2018 we\u2019re going to be incorporating two rate hikes in that plan. I think the other point to think about also is remember Q1 is also is kind of always a weird quarter in terms of day count and is a little bit beneficial in terms of NIM because of Q1 day count every year.", "Bill Rogers", "Got it. And that three basis points, how much greater beta does that contemplate relative to the 20ish percent that you indicated you\u2019re assuming for fourth quarter \u201917? We\u2019re going to continue to nudge that up, so we are modeling in slightly higher betas with every rate hike. But always slightly higher. Looking at what client behavior is, how the market is operating and how deliberate and careful the FRB is in terms of rate hikes. I\u2019m not expecting a big spike up in overall betas.", "Operator", "And that would come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ", "Mike Mayo", "So, the consumer banking efficiency ratio in the second quarter was 67%. In the third quarter it was 62% and that just is like did you find a magic bullet; did you sprinkle fairly dust and what\u2019s going on there and is that sustainable? So, one question is should we expect that to bounce back or was that abnormally high in the second quarter? Second part of that is what was the retention rate in the branches that you closed in terms of deposits in customers. And then lastly as far as LightStream is that playing a role and how much?", "Aleem Gillani ", "So, let me start-off with the efficiency ratio point. Yes, there was a big improvement in efficiency ratio quarter-on-quarter, but that\u2019s really caused by or really benefited by the reversal of those legal accruals, several of the items that we settled during the quarter were legacy items that dated back several years, relating to mortgage and one of those benefited the efficiency ratio for consumer for the quarter. ", "So, I wouldn\u2019t think about a core efficiency ratio for consumer as 62 immediately, we\u2019re working obviously to get there and better overtime, but I wouldn\u2019t think of that as a Q4 automatic number. ", "Bill Rogers", "Yes, and then Mike I\u2019ll try to hit with the second part and maybe add-on what Aleem said is, while that was a one-time don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that we have had steady improvement there that we\u2019re going to continue to have steady improvement there. So that matched a little bit of the improvement that you see overall. ", "As it relates to the brand side and retention, our retention side has been really, really good, so, it's been well north of 90% and that has to do with all of the things that I talked about earlier, it has to do with the density of our branch network and being larger higher growing urban market, so generally we are closing branches that are in close proximity to other branches. ", "But it also has to do with not necessarily LightStream, but it does have a lot to do with the investments that we have made in digital and the adoption that we have had from our clients. So, used to be that branch proximity was sort of the highest correlation, but now it's just one of the variables, the other variables are the tenure of the relationship, which as you know we have long tangent relationships and they are not only mobile adoption but there is utilization of the digital platforms, which for us are pretty high. So, you put all those in the variables and the retention rates have been strong. That will get harder as it goes along, right, so as we continue to look at the platform and some of those things change, but so far, our experience has been very good. ", "Mike Mayo ", "And then just one follow up, at the start of the call, I thought you said record LightStream origination, if that\u2019s the case what\u2019s the potential to use LightStream to eliminate more branch expenses? ", "Bill Rogers", "It's not really a correlation necessarily with branch expenses, but today something like 25% or so of the originations of LightStream come through the SunTrust platform, so I wouldn\u2019t say there is much of eliminate expenses as it is create additional and incremental opportunity with our clients. So, it's more of the top side of the efficiency ratio, than the bottom side of the efficiency ratio. ", "Aleem Gillani ", "Yeah Mike, think of LightStream as a whole new distribution channel, a digital channel for connecting with clients and potential clients all over the country, rather than a replacement for the brand channel. ", "Ankur Vyas", "Great everyone. Thank you for joining our call, if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the IR department, and simply you can now disconnect us.

Welcome to the SunTrust Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Ankur Vyas. Please go ahead.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thanks, Leah. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release [Technical Difficulty].", "Ankur Vyas", "The press release, the presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com. With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. ", "During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance.

", "Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "William Rogers", "Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of the fourth quarter and full year, which we highlight on Slide 3 and 4, and then I'll turn it over to Aleem for some additional details. I'll conclude with some more strategic perspectives on our 2017 performance, our purpose and thoughts headed into 2018. ", "We reported $1.48 of earnings per share for the quarter, which includes $0.39 per share in net benefits associated with the actions we announced on our December 4 8-K and the impact of tax reform, including actions we took as a result. The December 4 8-K primarily highlighted the sale of our PAC business and associated gain but also important initiatives around organizational efficiency, technology enhancements and real estate that will collectively better position the company for improved long-term success. In addition, given our purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being, we thought it was important to invest a portion of the benefits of tax reform in our teammates and communities, each of which is foundational to our success. These contributions, which totaled $75 million in the fourth quarter, will support the financial confidence of our teammates and communities for years to come. ", "Aleem will provide more details on these items but I'm going to focus on the adjusted earnings, which were $1.09 for the quarter and $4.09 for the full year. Overall, I'd characterize this quarter as a good conclusion to a very strong year for SunTrust. In 2017, we grew the core earnings of the company by 14%, improved our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio by 100 basis points, increased our dividend by 54% and our share repurchases by 38%. As owners, you certainly benefited from our strong performance. Our total shareholder return was 20%, which was more than 700 basis points higher than the median of our peer group. ", "While we benefited from a favorable operating environment, a key driver of our outperformance this year was our improved executional abilities. We have instilled a culture of continuous improvement across the company. We've raised the bar together, and teammates have risen to the challenge. We're meeting more client needs. We're showing increased discipline on expenses and returns. We're ultimately improving the long-term earnings power of the franchise. ", "So to get into some of the specifics of the quarter, our net interest margin improved by 2 basis points sequentially, which drove a modest increase in net interest income. Fourth quarter lending activity was not meaningfully different with all of 2017, with solid consumer lending growth offset by declines in C&I. Tax reform should begin to change the trajectory of C&I though the timing and slope are difficult to predict at this juncture. ", "From the fee side, we had another great full year in capital markets even after the fourth quarter decline. Certain deal activity was pushed into 2018, and much of this decline was offset by strength in client-driven commercial real estate income, particularly Structured Real Estate where pipelines have been building nicely throughout the year and were realized in the fourth quarter. All in all, revenues were stable sequentially and up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. ", "On an adjusted basis, we showed continuous improvement in our efficiency with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 59.9% in the fourth quarter and 61% for the full year. Looking to 2018, the impact of tax reform has on our FTE adjustments and compensation growth will be a bit of an efficiency headwind for us and the industry. But given the actions we took in the last 2 quarters of the year, combined with our ongoing expense discipline, which had us on a path to be around 60% in 2018 before the FTE change, we still expect to improve our efficiency ratio this year. Aleem is going to talk more about this in a minute. ", "Credit quality continues to be a strength for us, and the full year net charge-off ratio was 25 basis points, the fourth consecutive year of net charge-offs being below our through-the-cycle expectations. This reflects a strong economic environment, the diversity of our loan portfolio and the conservative risk posture we've taken. Even after an almost 90% total payout ratio in 2017, capital ratios ended the year higher than where they started with a Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.6% on a fully phased-in basis, giving us some incremental capacity to support strong growth for both our clients and our owners. ", "So with that as an overview, let me turn over to Aleem.", "Aleem Gillani", "Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. As Bill mentioned, there are several discrete items in the quarter, which we list on Slide 5. The first set of items relates to the actions we took in our December 4 8-K, including the sale of our PAC business, which resulted in a $107 million pretax gain. PAC contributed approximately $55 million of revenue, $25 million of expense and $20 million of net income over the last 12 months. Much of the PAC gain was offset by several charges in the fourth quarter, which allow us to accelerate certain efficiency initiatives. Specifically, we offered a voluntary retirement option to eligible teammates, consolidated operation centers, terminated additional branch leases, wrote down certain software assets and prepared for the consolidation of our mortgage legal entity into the bank, the latter of which partially impacted the valuation allowance against DTAs within SunTrust Mortgage. The net impact of all these items was a $0.03 EPS benefit. ", "Separately, in connection with tax reform, our net deferred tax liability position was reduced by approximately $300 million, which resulted in an income tax benefit this quarter. We also took certain actions to enhance the company's future earnings potential, including a repositioning of our securities portfolio. Finally, as Bill mentioned, we announced important investments in the long-term financial well-being of our teammates and communities. The net impact of these items was a $0.36 EPS benefit. In 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% on a reported basis and 21% to 22% if you model us on a fully taxable equivalent basis. ", "Moving to Slide 6. Our net interest margin improved 2 basis points this quarter, in part due to some discrete benefits in the current quarter, including loan fees and nonaccrual recoveries. When excluding these items, the net interest margin was relatively stable as the benefit from lower premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio was largely offset by an increase in deposit costs. ", "Separately, as you know, we and many of our peers in the industry report our NIM and efficiency ratio on a fully taxable equivalent basis or FTE, which means we gross up the interest income on tax-exempt loans by approximately 35% to reflect the equivalent yield they would earn if the interest income were taxable. This adjustment increases our net interest income by approximately $150 million per year, which positively impacts our NIM by 8 basis points. All things being equal, a lower corporate tax rate will reduce the FTE adjustment by about half and negatively impact our FTE NIM by 4 basis points and the FTE efficiency ratio by 50 basis points. From a bottom line perspective, there's no impact as these changes simply impact income statement geography. ", "During the quarter, we sold about $3 billion of securities and reinvested in a portfolio with similar mix and higher yields, which will increase interest income by approximately $20 million per year, all else equal. Looking at the first quarter, we expect the net interest margin to increase between 0 and 2 basis points as the benefit of the December rate hike is mostly offset by the change in FTE calculation. Beyond that, NIM trends will depend on the rate environment, but we do expect NIM expansion in 2018 as the short end of the curve continues to rise. ", "Moving to Slide 7, you'll see that noninterest income decreased by $13 million sequentially largely due to the decline in capital markets-related income given our strong performance in the first 3 quarters of the year and the delay of certain client transactions into 2018. While capital markets-related income was down for 1 quarter, on a full year basis, investment banking income was up 21%, which represents the 10th consecutive year of growth and was a key contributor to our overall revenue growth in 2017. Much of the decline in capital markets was offset by a higher commercial real estate-related income, which increased $45 million sequentially due to Structured Real Estate transactions and seasonality in both Pillar and SunTrust Community Capital, our affordable housing and community development business. And finally, the net impact of the discrete items I discussed on Slide 5 was a $7 million negative impact to noninterest income. Looking to the next quarter, we expect capital markets to rebound nicely while commercial real estate-related income will decline from that seasonally strong fourth quarter level. ", "Expenses increased by $129 million sequentially driven by the discrete items in the current quarter, which we discussed on Slide 5, in addition to the net $14 million of discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter. We have now taken $80 million of efficiency-related charges in the past 2 quarters, which collectively have an approximate 2-year payback. On a core basis, expenses were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter and prior year as a result of improved expense management and efficiency efforts. As a reminder, our core personnel expenses, which exclude the $25 million increase in employee benefits in the fourth quarter, should increase by approximately $75 million in the first quarter due to the typical seasonal increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses. ", "As you see on Slide 9, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 59.9% and 61% for the full year. It's clear that the efficiency initiatives we've been implementing for several years are driving consistent, positive operating leverage. Not only have the investments we've made in growth driven strong revenue, we're also demonstrating heightened vigor around expense management, which enabled us to deliver a full year efficiency ratio that was at the bottom of our guided range. Looking to 2018, there will be certain headwinds to efficiency as a result of tax reform, both optical from FTE adjustments and actual from increased investments in our people and technology. Even after this, we're confident in our ability to improve the efficiency ratio in 2018 due to our heightened expense discipline, the actions we took in the last 2 quarters and a positive economic and revenue outlook. ", "Moving to Slide 10. Net charge-offs increased 8 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the resolution of certain C&I credits that have been in our workout pipeline. Despite this, our asset quality metrics remained very strong and well below through-the-cycle expectations, evidenced by a full year 25 basis point net charge-off ratio and a 47 basis point nonperforming loan ratio. The low level of net charge-offs reflect the relative strength we're seeing across our C&I portfolio, performance we are extremely pleased with, though we remain cognizant that there could be both variability and normalization going forward. Provision expense declined as a result of the prior quarter reserve build related to the hurricanes. Overall, we expect to operate within a 25 to 35 basis point net charge-off ratio in 2018 and expect a provision level that should approximate net charge-offs, though there may be some quarter-to-quarter variability. ", "Average loans were stable sequentially as growth in consumer lending offset declines in C&I. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew 1% with broad-based growth across most consumer lending products. Within C&I, lower revolver utilization and elevated paydowns continue to mask improving production numbers. Some of the decline is also due to our increased focus on returns, which has led us to exit certain lending relationships which don't meet our return hurdles. Looking ahead, we continue to have positive dialogue with our clients, and we believe that tax reform is a catalyst for increased investment and growth. Further, we're well positioned to meet their needs, whether via lending, capital markets or other solutions. ", "Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially and 2% year-over-year with growth across most products and both segments. Consistent with our previous commentary, the strong deposit growth we have produced over the past several years, in addition to our access to low-cost funding, enables us to prudently manage our funding base and, therefore, more effectively manage our overall deposit beta. Our goal continues to be to maximize our value proposition outside of rate paid by meeting more of our clients' needs via strategic investments in talent and technology. ", "Let's move to Slide 13. Given the net gains this quarter, our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 9.6%, up slightly relative to the prior quarter. In addition, we issued $500 million of preferred stock in November, helping us to further optimize our capital stack and reduce our weighted average cost of capital. At this point, our non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital stacks are fairly optimized, and any other near-term issuance will be limited to refinancing existing issues and/or replacing maturities. Given our strong capital position, combined with our improved earnings trajectory, we have incremental capacity to increase capital returns to our owners, the specifics of which will depend upon our rigorous capital planning process over the coming months. ", "Moving to the segment overviews, we'll begin with the Consumer segment on Slide 14, where we continue to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum. One of our primary strategic priorities at SunTrust has been to improve our balance sheet diversity and enhance returns. As a result, we've invested consistently in LightStream and our credit card business. The investments we've made continue to yield positive results, which have more than offset the declines in home equity, evidenced by the 5% increase in average total loans in 2017. These efforts, combined with our continued deposit growth, were key drivers of the 7% full year increase in net interest income. Growth in net interest income helped to offset the 17% decline in mortgage production volume. ", "Noninterest income was also pressured by lower service charges given the posting order changes that were made in the fourth quarter of 2016. On the other hand, our wealth management business is beginning to show modest growth, a reversal of previous trends. We took significant actions in 2017 to improve our client coverage model and are seeing early results. We have also invested in new advisers, both within our existing markets and in new markets. Big picture, our value proposition for our targeted client segments is resonating in the marketplace, driving growth in new clients, greater wallet share with existing clients and overall AUM growth. ", "Expenses were up $117 million relative to the prior quarter, driven primarily by the discrete items in the current quarter, including the discretionary 401(k) contribution and efficiency-related charges. The third quarter was also favorably impacted by the $58 million in legal accrual reversals. Expenses were stable relative to 2016 as a result of our continued expense management efforts, including continued reductions in our branch network and investments in self-served channels, including mobile. ", "Provision expense increased $196 million relative to 2016 as a result of the reserve build associated with the hurricanes, in addition to strong loan growth. Overall, we took significant actions in 2017 to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Consumer segment, including the integration of mortgage into consumer. We are beginning to realize the benefits of the strategic change, which creates an enhanced client-centric approach by having all consumer products and services under one segment and improves scale. We are in the early stages of executing this strategy. We've got a great team in place and are confident about the potential this segment has to grow revenues and improve profitability. ", "Moving to Wholesale Banking on Slide 15. For this business, 2017 was a great year. We delivered record revenue of $4.1 billion and record net income of $1.4 billion, in part due to strong market conditions and a benign credit environment but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we're having with our clients. Fourth quarter revenue was inclusive of the $107 million gain on the sale of PAC. After excluding this, revenues were up 1% sequentially and 14% on a full year basis. The sequential increase was driven primarily by higher net interest income and commercial real estate-related income, which offset the decline in capital markets. Compared to 2016, the increase in revenue was primarily driven by net interest income and investment banking income, which was up by a full 21%. ", "Investment banking's performance demonstrates the success we're having in increasing our strategic relevance with new and existing clients. It is clear that we're continuing to take market share and become a more relevant capital markets provider. Specifically, our left -- lead relationships are up 12%, M&A and equity both had record years and our average fee per transaction was up 9%. Additionally, we're not just becoming more relevant with our CIB clients, we're also -- we also continue to focus on bringing product and industry expertise to our commercial banking clients. We're making good progress here and earned a 10% increase in capital markets revenues from these clients in 2017. We have great momentum going into 2018, and we're very confident in our abilities to continue to grow capital markets revenues. ", "Noninterest expense was up 12% relative to 2016 as a result of the acquisition of Pillar. Higher compensation tied to strong revenue growth and ongoing investments in technology. Core revenue growth was a strong 14%, and as a result, wholesale's adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved by 130 basis points to 44.5%. Provision expense declined meaningfully in 2017, given the continued resolution of energy credits and overall strength within the C&I portfolio. These declines, combined with the strong revenue growth and improved profitability, drove meaningful improvements in net income, which was up 34% even after excluding the sale of PAC. Looking ahead, while market conditions may create quarterly variability, our differentiated business model and strong executional abilities in Wholesale Banking deliver strong results for our clients and shareholders. We expect to see further growth in 2018, particularly as economic growth accelerates in response to tax reform. ", "With that, let me turn the call back over to Bill.", "William Rogers", "Thanks, Aleem. I'll forward to Slide 16, which highlights how our long-term financial performance trajectory, including 2017, aligns with our overall investment thesis. First, we have an attractive franchise with great diversity and growth opportunities. This diversity helped drive revenue growth and 14% core EPS growth compared to 2016 even after absorbing the 37% decline in mortgage production income. The growth we continue to see is largely the result of the consistent strategic investments we've made over the years. Specifically, within CIB, we've been particularly focused on investing in our M&A and equity platforms to allow us to become the strategic adviser of choice. Both M&A and equity had record performance in 2017, and they have great momentum going into 2018. Our competitive advantage continues to resonate with clients and is a key contributor to our continued market share gains. ", "Within commercial banking, we're investing heavily in developing our industry and Corporate Finance expertise such that we can deliver increasingly sophisticated solutions to our clients. While we're in the early stages, our execution against this strategy was a contributor to wholesale's record performance this year and also a key part of our decision to expand our commercial banking presence outside of our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic footprint. Within consumer, the investments we've made in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are providing top-notch experiences for our clients, in addition to consistent and profitable growth. ", "And finally, across our company, we've made and continue to make meaningful investments in technology to modernize our infrastructure and deliver differentiated experiences which embody our purpose, meet evolving client needs and position us for growth. Specifically, we continue to invest heavily in our mobile app. We made it easier for clients to manage their financial well-being by adding advanced peer-to-peer payment capabilities using Zelle and displaying FICO scores. We gave clients more control over their financial lives by providing the ability to lock and unlock credit cards in real time. ", "Additionally, we introduced SunTrust Deals, which offers personalized rewards and discounts based on clients' preferences and spending habits. We've also made good progress in developing an API and cloud-based framework for infrastructure development, which allows us to more easily integrate with apps, services and digital experiences across the ecosystem. And finally, we've significantly enhanced our core infrastructure by upgrading our loan origination platforms within wholesale and mortgage, transferring certain activities to the cloud and began upgrading our core teller platform, which, when combined with our introduction of Zelle, significantly enhances our broader payment capabilities. ", "So looking to 2018, we'll continue to make significant investments in our technology platforms and have several items in the pipeline, including a new enterprise client portal, a fully digitized mortgage application and increased use of various forms of automation to streamline end-to-end processes and improve efficiency. As you can tell, we remain highly focused on improving our efficiency both to ensure we have sufficient capacity to make future investments in growth in technology and to improve the overall profitability of the company. ", "We've made good progress this year, evidenced by the 100 basis point improvement in our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. We still have significant room for improvement, and there are a few important actions we took in 2017 to ensure that we fully capitalize upon our opportunity set. We decided to consolidate mortgage, which historically had been a separate business segment, into consumer. This provides us with the opportunities to streamline operations and created greater alignment among all of our consumer-oriented channels. ", "We also created an efficiency office, and the work they've done have enabled a heightened focus and rigor around driving and sustaining efficiency in order to position the company for long-term growth and success. Finally, as Aleem highlighted, we took a total of $80 million in charges in the last 2 quarters, which allowed us to accelerate our progress against several key initiatives, primarily around organizational efficiency. These charges have a relatively short payback and further improvement in efficiency momentum we have going into -- and further the improvement of efficiency momentum we have going into 2018. ", "Of note, as we improve the efficiency of the company, we're also enhancing our overall return profile. Specifically, when excluding the discrete benefits in the fourth quarter, our return on tangible common equity in 2017 was 12.2%, a full 130 basis points improvement over 2016. And last but certainly not least, our strong capital position allowed us to increase our capital return by 47% in 2017. We reduced our share count by 3%. And our dividend yield is now in the top 1/3 relative to our peers, such as you as owners now benefit from an attractive yield combined with a franchise that has strong growth opportunities. ", "While these business accomplishments, I think, are impressive, what I'm equally proud of is the progress we've made in advancing our purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being. We launched Momentum onUp in June, which is the industry-leading workplace financial wellness program we offer to our corporate and commercial clients to equip their employees with the tools they need for financial success. We had 70 companies sign up in 2017, and the early results are extremely encouraging. Participants walk away with a much better understanding of their net worth, the importance of a budget, an emergency savings plan and, ultimately, greater financial confidence. In fact, 99.5% of participants would recommend Momentum onUp to others. ", "We also celebrated the opening of SunTrust Park, which included the opening of the onUp Experience center, which is a unique space that uses fun and interactive baseball activities to engage fans to learn more about gaining financial confidence while also strengthening our brand as a purpose-driven, client-first company. And clearly, the $75 million investment announced in the fourth quarter will be meaningful in improving the long-term financial well-being of our teammates and our communities. ", "Before I close, I wanted to tell you about a leadership appointment we'll be announcing after this call. Our Chief Information Officer, Anil Cheriyan, has decided to retire at the end of March. It seems appropriate to mention it here as he's been a significant contributor to the results we've delivered. Scott Case, who was previously our Consumer Technology Officer, will become our new CIO and is perfectly suited to build upon the technology momentum I just outlined. ", "In conclusion, I'd like to say I'm incredibly proud of this company and the team that we have in place. For each of the past 6 years, we've grown the earnings of the company, we've improved our efficiency and we've increased our capital return to owners. We've been able to do this because of a consistent strategy and discipline around financial performance and returns. Looking into 2018, I'm optimistic about the tailwinds that tax reform will provide to us and the broader economy. Further, given our position within the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, we should see outsized benefits from increased economic growth. While tax reform will provide benefits to our bottom line and increase capacity to invest in clients, teammates, communities and owners, I continue to expect strong discipline and rigor in our balance sheet and investment prioritization process. ", "We've made great progress in recent years, and the momentum we've created should help 2018 be the seventh consecutive year of higher earnings per share, improved efficiency and higher capital returns. Equally exciting now is my belief that we're just beginning to realize our long-term potential. I want to pause for a second and thank all of the great SunTrust teammates whose tireless dedication to our purpose makes all this possible. So teammates, thank you. ", "And with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur.", "Ankur Vyas", "Thanks, Bill. Leah, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions].", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And we will take a question from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.", "Matthew O'Connor", "You guys bank a very wide spectrum of commercial and corporate clients, obviously, both on the lending side and helping to originate debt on the banking side. So it's like you might have a good perspective on the potential for commercial loan demand to pick up and how meaningful that could be, the timing of that. Or does it kind of still get psyched away into the capital markets, which, obviously, you benefit as well? But just trying to get a sense of -- could we see a little more balance between the loan demand and some of the banking demand with the tax reform and maybe the timing of that?", "William Rogers", "Yes, Matt. We spend a whole lot of time with our clients. And I clearly feel and I think tax reform was a further accelerant, growing and increasing confidence in their business prospects, and we see that in the surveys that we did. If you -- I would just sort of look at ours and break it down. I think maybe it will actually help answer the question a little bit. If I think about sort of health metrics that I look at, sort of core loan growth, as Aleem mentioned, our production has been really good. As a matter of fact, this quarter was sort of our second-best production quarter, and the last quarter was our second-best production quarter in the last 8 quarters. So production as a health metric continues to be strong. Then if you look at sort of our core companies, middle market kind of lending, I mean that's continued to grow sort of mid-single digits.", "So if that's a barometer of where the economy is, I think that's a pretty strong indication, and I think that, that should continue. So really, the hanging chat, as what you've talked about, is how much of this paydown part will continue. I think what we're seeing is an opportunity to increase investments. I think overall if I sort of look into '18 and beyond, I think, thinking about loan growth as a GDP plus kind of concept, I think, is realistic, but timing of that is a little hard to predict. I think that's probably a little more towards the latter part of this year and the first part of next year. But I just see that what I -- when I look at those health metrics, I see sort of like core commercial bases just continuing to grow.", "Matthew O'Connor", "Okay. And then just separately, you guys had a very early partnership with GreenSky on the consumer lending area. And I think you guys had a stake or have a stake in that, and I'm wondering if you can confirm that and if you'd sized it. It's been in the press recently in terms of raising some private equity and [indiscernible] valuation on that, so I want to see if you could confirm your stake in that.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. Matt, it's Aleem. Yes, absolutely, we can confirm that we do have a stake in GreenSky and that we expect that the partnership that we have with them will continue to get better over time. We really like the partnership that we have with GreenSky. We think we were one of the early investors and have helped them grow. And so we think we have a special relationship with them, and we expect that to continue to do better over time.", "Operator", "And next, we have a question from the line of Ken Usdin.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Appreciate your opening comments about investing in the franchise with some of the benefits from tax and still committing to operating leverage. Just wondering if you could help us understand the phasing and even the magnitude of the incremental spend that you're thinking about and how you're balancing that against operating leverage. We obviously see it in the efficiency ratio guidance, but just wondering how you're balancing the 2.", "William Rogers", "Yes. Ken, it's Bill. I think let me sort of start with a punchline. I fundamentally believe that a large majority, and I don't want to put a percent on it, of the benefits of tax reform are going to fall to bottom line. So I mean, I think that's sort of where we start, and I think that's particularly over the short term. Beyond that, that becomes a little harder to predict and -- based on a lot of factors, including whatever the competitive environment may be. Now that being said, might there be some incremental investments that we make that make more sense now given tax reform? That might be the case, and we're going to look carefully at that. But that's going to go through our normal investment planning process, so I don't expect sort of a big step-up function.", "As you know, we've been investing in our company for years and continue to do that. And a lot of the efficiency gains that we get, we continue to make part of our investment strategy. So that's been part of the fuel that's been pumping our investment for a while and will continue to do so. And then I also don't see any sort of glaring gap that is going to require us to spend hundreds of millions of dollars that we didn't spend before to fix or put in place. And as you noted, we're also making the commitment to continue to improve our efficiency ratio. I mean, if you sort of do the math, I mean, what we're saying is we think we'll have another 100 basis point improvement in our core efficiency ratio for this year.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Understood. And as a follow-up on the lending side, you guys, in the past, have been relatively conservative and, I think, have talked about in the past that you'd like to stay on that side of things. But do you look at opportunity sets here, especially given the potential, as you mentioned, for loan growth to hopefully improve and think about either opening up the credit box a little bit or reevaluating some of the places where you'd like to see incremental business generation?", "William Rogers", "I think, as you know, I mean, we have been conservative. That's part of our strategy. We think we want a capital base that reflects that conservatism and see it in our CCAR results that are being at the lower decile or quartile of others in terms of capital degradation. That being said, at sort of post tax reform, are there new deals that might hurdle that didn't hurdle before? Yes, I mean, that might be the case. And we'll look at that on an individual basis. It will go through the same rigorous process that we have. But it's not a case of opening the floodgates. It's a case of sort of incrementally looking at opportunities, given some different dynamics from a return perspective.", "Aleem Gillani", "And Ken, let me come back to your first question for a moment on operating leverage and efficiency ratio. In '17 over '16, we delivered a full point of efficiency ratio improvement from 62% to 61%, and in '18, we expect to do that again. We expect to get another full point of efficiency ratio improvement. But just remember that optically, because of that FTE impact, that full point will look like 0.5 point.", "Kenneth Usdin", "Right. 50 basis points, right?", "Aleem Gillani", "Right. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.", "Saul Martinez", "So I guess, just following up on reinvestment, positive operating leverage. Your tax guide, 20%, is about, I guess, a 10 percentage point reduction, more or less, to where you were. And you're generating about, I guess, $3 billion or so, more or less, in pretax profits, so it looks like the windfall is about $300 million or so. Have you put parameters or quantified how much of that you think is -- should be reinvested in various initiatives you talked about? How should we think about that in the context of your cost guidance -- or your cost expectations?", "William Rogers", "Yes. I think, I mean, back to the answer before, I think a large majority of that benefit is going to inure to the shareholders. I think the discipline that we've had in the system, the constant trade for efficiency and investment and that continued process that we've had in place, that's just not going to change. I mean, again, as I said before, there's not sort of a onetime thing that we're going to put in place. So I'm hesitant about putting percentages because I just don't think that's the way that we think about it. And I think just take solace in what we think, is the majority of that, again, in the short term is going to fall to the bottom line.", "Saul Martinez", "Okay, that's helpful. I guess just going back to the loan growth question then. You mentioned obviously utilization rates and paydowns being elevated. And I know you don't manage the loan growth, but is there any way to put some numbers or some parameters around how much fall in utilization rates and paydowns impacted your loan growth -- if we had a more normalized level of paydowns or utilization rates were constant, how much would that have impacted loan balances? And I just -- I guess I'm trying to get at, if those things do normalize, how much of a tailwind that could be going forward.", "William Rogers", "Yes. I mean, just not to put direct math to it because those are sort of constantly moving numbers, but if you just take C&I specifically, I mean, paydowns exceeded production. And we produced total loans somewhere in the $8 billion-plus kind of category so you can sort of do your own math on that in terms of what that might be if paydowns were to normalize. I struggle with it because I don't know what normalize means. I think we have to sort of think about environments change, things are in different mode. But my earlier comments around overall loan growth going forward, I think, take into account that things do return to levels that we've seen before, and I think that's where I get back to, sort of a GDP plus kind of mentality as we think about loan growth. So if we're looking at a 2.5% to 3% GDP, I think that's a reasonable expectation longer term, meaning sort of towards the end of this year and into next year as we think about loan growth.", "Operator", "And next, we have a question from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari", "On the commercial real estate-related income that you saw from Pillar and the other operations there, I think you alluded to some of that was impacted by tax-advantaged business. And would you say at all that a proportion of that is inflated this year because of the pending tax reform and accordingly, we can see a reversion next quarter? And if so, by how much is that delta so we can model it?", "William Rogers", "No. If the implication was that it was tax reform related, I don't think that's quite an accurate representation. It does have seasonality towards the fourth quarter. I mean that's just sort of the natural flow of that business. So all of that business is client-driven. It did have some seasonality, probably a little more beta on that seasonality than we normally have. So as it relates to next year, I mean, we expect that business to continue to be positive. The first quarter will be lower than the fourth quarter because that's just a seasonality impact rather than a fundamental change or onetime aspect of the business. So all client-driven, not onetime, not specific tax reform business, just sort of core good business in the fourth quarter.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. And then on the margin, wanted to get -- just to see if you could quantify the amount of the loan fees and -- or the benefits of the margin from the higher loan fees and interest recoveries in the quarter and then your thoughts on the trajectory of the margins through 2018 as deposit beta starts to build.", "Aleem Gillani", "John, the fees, I think, that we picked up in the fourth quarter, I would think in the context of 1 to 2 basis points. And then as I look out into 2018, the first quarter, I'd say, is kind of 0 to 2 basis points positive. And then after that, it depends on the trajectory of rate hikes. Any quarter that we get a Fed hike or the quarter after it will typically pick up three-or-so basis points. And then when -- in a quarter where there isn't a Fed hike, we'll get a little bit of a grind downward.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And remind me what you're modeling in terms of the Fed actions for 2018.", "Aleem Gillani", "Well, as you know, we're typically a little bit on the conservative side. So with the Fed suggesting that they'll hikes three times this year, we're modeling two hikes", "Operator", "And next, we go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Michael Mayo", "My basic question is, why can't get to your 60% efficiency target in 2018 instead of 2019? Now you have additional tailwinds from rates, revenues, regulation, and not to take anything away from you, Bill. Since you've been there as CEO, the efficiency ratio is down 10 percentage points. I heard what you said. Last year, that improved by another percentage point. This year, you're expect it to improve by another percentage point, so, certainly, all going in the right direction. It just seems like -- if you wanted to, it seems like you could be there. Maybe that's why you're getting so many questions on the reinvestment. I mean, the list of investments, kind of like 10 different areas you're investing in based on just what was said on this call. So I guess to ask an earlier question a little bit differently, how do you balance the trade-off between letting some of these benefits fall to the bottom line to shareholders today and reinvesting that for shareholders in the future? It seems like your investments -- your pace of investing might have gone up, but if you could clarify that.", "William Rogers", "Yes. I think, Mike, first of all, these FTE adjustments are sort of making this conversation a little more difficult. Let me make it really clear. We're going to get to 60% net of the equity adjustment. So before, we've said 60% was a longer-term trajectory. And net of FTE, actually, we would get to 60% in '18. That's exactly the place where we want to be. So challenge accepted and delivered. Of course, we've got to deliver it for the year, but challenge accepted. As it relates to the continued level of investment, that's all in light of that efficiency target. We clearly have outlined things that we're investing in. I mean, constantly, that's what we evaluate as a company, but that's in light of the efficiencies that we create. So we run this through a model that sort of says invest -- save $1, invest $1 kind of process for our business leaders, with the thought process that you also got to continue to drive down the efficiency ratio.", "So I think that intensity is in there. The reason we talk so much about investment is we want to make sure that everyone understands, from a shareholders' perspective, this is not a short-term gain for us. This is a long-term gain. So as soon as we're hitting the efficiency targets, we're also not forgetting the fact that we're investing for the long term in the company. So if we've over-calibrated maybe in terms of how we talk about that, I think, in fairness, we probably under-calibrated before. We didn't talk enough about investment and probably too much about expense saves. And really, the desire here is to calibrate and to balance that dialogue because they are both equally important and this is a long-term deal for us.", "Michael Mayo", "And then the follow-up relates to Slide 14. And compared to some peers, it's a disappointment compared to where you might want to go. Maybe it's an opportunity. But you closed 100 branches. That's 7% of the total. Yet, the efficiency ratio in the Consumer segment was flat '16 to '17. I think there must be some noise in that '17 number, but even after eliminating some of that noise, it seems like the consumer efficiency probably isn't where you need it to be. And you did highlight the investments in LightStream and digital banking and automation and cloud and the mortgage restructuring into consumer. What are your expectations for the Consumer segment efficiency? And did I characterize that correctly?", "William Rogers", "Well, also, I mean, you certainly characterized it correctly in terms of the opportunity. I mean, from a math perspective, just if you sort of -- so consumer and wholesale, just to make it easy, 50%, 50% of the business. Wholesale is pretty much at the efficiency ratio in terms of top quartile or top decile in terms of how we look at performance. Now that's not to take the bell off the hook by any means. I mean we want to continue to strive and do those kind of things. But the bulk of the efficiency savings going forward are in the Consumer segment, as you accurately pointed out. But things like the mortgage consolidation with consumer create savings. That's why that's highlighted. The branch closures start to create more opportunity on an ongoing basis. The other efficiencies that we've taken in terms of transactional efficiencies and process improvements really primarily rest in the consumer side.", "Operator", "And next, we have a question from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.", "Marlin Mosby", "Maybe we'd take a little different tilt on the investments and talk about the returns. You have restructuring the securities portfolio this quarter, which you say it could generate $20 million. That's about a 5-year payback. That's pretty conservative. I would think that could do a little bit better even than that. You've got the $80 million, which is going to turn into $40 million of annual benefit that you've talked about there. And then you've been investing in your capital markets business, which then you talked about the deal activity that was spiked, but, yet, you didn't really even reap all the benefits of that as it comes in the first part of next year. So it looks like there's some returns that actually give you some momentum as you go into next year that you've been able to take from the investments you've been putting out there so far.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes, Marty. I think you're completely right. We've got a number of initiatives that we put in place. We expect to be reaping the benefits of those initiatives over the course of the next several years. You're right about securities. You're right about the other things you've mentioned. There are a couple of efficiency ratio headwinds, as we've mentioned. But those are -- some of those are optical, and that's efficiency ratio as opposed to bottom line. If you focus on bottom line, we're pretty optimistic about what we can deliver over the next couple of years. And if you think about what our shareholders really care about, and it's the return on capital, we think that our ROTCE over the next couple of years is going to be considerably higher than it has been over the last couple of years. This year, as Bill mentioned earlier, we did grow our ROTCE to 12.2%. We've crossed that 12% barrier. And next couple of years, we're looking for floors to ROTCE that would be even higher than that.", "Marlin Mosby", "And a follow-up, so one of the backdrops of all your adjustments this particular quarter were a few nuggets that kind of also were hidden. One is your tangible book value was about 2% higher because you had the net gain from DTO versus a lot of other banks that were actually writing down their DTAs. So you actually had a 2% increase in tangible book value, which is a nice base adjustment. And then your capital ratios went up because of that as well, which then gives you even more kind of ammunition going into next year's CCAR and thinking about the acceleration of deploying some of that excess capital. So just wanted to think about those two things as well.", "William Rogers", "No, I think that's exactly right, Marty. And that's part of the reason we have the confidence in saying, of the things that are continuing on the seventh year of improvement is continued increase in our return to shareholders. So as you duly noted, we got to get all the CCAR stuff and all those caveats, but we enter into this with a stronger capital base and more opportunity to return to shareholders.", "Aleem Gillani", "Marty, I don't know if you've heard too many CFOs say this before, but I'm looking forward to seeing what the CCAR scenario is this year.", "Marlin Mosby", "I can imagine. And if you'll humor me one more question on credit. You have been building your allowance throughout the year, and then this quarter, you actually went the reverse. And it looks like you were providing for the losses that you took this quarter through the first 3 quarters of the year. So this was just a natural offset of that as you kind of got your provision down but net charge-offs bounced up just because of the recognition losses you already provided for.", "Aleem Gillani", "Yes. I'd say that our provision and allowance build was mostly in the third quarter, and that was for hurricanes. So we're expecting to see some of the hurricane charge-offs show up next year. And we provided for that early. Other than that, I'd say our allowance has been generally flat and maybe even slightly declining on a percentage basis.", "Operator", "That's the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.", "Gerard Cassidy", "A couple of questions. Can you guys tell us, when you're talking about the commercial loan growth earlier, what your utilization rates are in the C&I portfolio? And how do they compare in the past? And what do you think they could be over the next 12 to 18 months?", "William Rogers", "Yes. They've been -- sort of been in the high 20s to low 30s, and they've been pretty consistent. I mean, that's a barometer that we all look at, but it moves in tectonic ways. I mean, it just doesn't move a lot in any one particular quarter. It's sort of slightly down now, but that's reflecting sort of some of the comments we've made. But I think that's one of the levers. But I think that's the lever, quite frankly, that moves the slowest. I think the things that we talked about in terms of production and paydowns have a bigger R-square, so to speak, to loan growth in the short term.", "Gerard Cassidy", "Very good. And then second, obviously, you guys put up a good quarter, like many of your peers. 2017 has been a very good year for the banks and the bank stocks. '18 looks real good as well. So all of us know we have to look around corners for potential risks. What do you guys look at? Because, again, things are very good for you and for your peers, what do you kind of worry about? Or what are you looking on the horizon that you got to keep your eye on?", "William Rogers", "Yes. I think you clearly have to look around the corner and think about the things that are tail risk or that are pending risk. I think all the businesses that relate to leverage and higher rates, we have to factor in. And so whether that's things on the credit card side, whether that's leverage lending in any shape or form, that's simply something that we have to look at. I don't see that as a near-term issue, in fairness, but as rates increase and leverage stays high, that's something we have to look at. Anything related to cyber is something that we have to be concerned about and think about. So those risks are risks that keep going for us and the industry almost exponentially, so that's something that we have to be vigilant and concerned about.", "Ankur Vyas", "Leah, this concludes our call.
