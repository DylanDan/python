My name is Christine, and I will be the operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Greg Ketron - Synchrony Financial", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.", "In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call.", "Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.", "Margaret Keane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Doubles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.", "Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.", "I'll begin on slide 3. First quarter net earnings totaled $499 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Our results were impacted by the 45% increase in the provision for loan losses we experienced this quarter, which was driven by growth and the normalization trends we are seeing in the portfolio and also by lower recovery pricing. Brian will describe these items in more detail later in the call.", "Continued execution of our business strategies helped generate strong organic growth in each of our sales platforms, which resulted in double-digit growth in loan receivable and interest and fees on loans for the company, as you can see on slide 4 of today's presentation.", "Furthermore, we grew purchase volume 7% and average active accounts 5% over the first quarter of last year. We are delivering value to partners and cardholders through attractive value propositions, promotional financing and strategic marketing offers, and this is helping to generate this growth.", "Looking at just our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 21%, exceeding U.S. growth trends which have been around 15%. And our Retail Card online sales penetration reached 26% in the first quarter. Net charge-offs came in at 5.33%, compared to 4.74% in the first quarter of last year. Our efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter versus 30.4% last year.", "Strong deposit generation supported the growth we generated this quarter. Deposits increased $7 billion or 15% to $52 billion. Deposits now comprise 72% of our funding sources. With a continued focus on competitive rates and customer service, we believe we can continue to drive deposit growth, though we would expect for that growth trend to be more in line with our receivables growth over the longer-term.", "Regarding capital and liquidity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 18%, and liquid assets totaled $16 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter-end. And we continued to execute our capital plan with quarterly common stock dividend of $0.13 and a repurchase of $238 million of common stock during the quarter.", "Looking at the business highlights this quarter, we renewed key partnerships with Belk, QVC and Midas. We also launched our Synchrony Car Care program, which offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations, as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide. We also continue to seek new partnership to augment growth, and we are excited to have launched our new program with Cathay Pacific during the quarter.", "In addition, as we continue to seek ways to expand our networking capabilities, we recently made two acquisitions. We acquired the Citi Health Card portfolio, which further expands our healthcare acceptance network in the United States.", "We also acquired GPShopper, an innovative developer of mobile apps that offers retails and brands a full suite of commerce, engagement and analytics tools. We are expanding our mobile engagement capabilities, improving the functionality and ease of use for our mobile users and our partners. And this capability-enhancing acquisition will help us to do that.", "You can view our sales platform performance on slide 5.", "I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Thanks, Margaret. And I'll start on slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $499 million of net income, translates to $0.61 per diluted share. We continued to deliver strong growth, with purchase volume up 7%, and loan receivables and interest and fees on loan receivables up 11% over last year.", "Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 5% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continued to resonate with consumers.", "Positive trends continued in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 6% compared to last year and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year.", "The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision for loan losses increased 45% over last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth.", "The reserve build was higher than we had expected. While most of the build continues to be driven by growth and the normalization we are seeing in the portfolio, lower recovery pricing in the quarter also drove approximately $50 million of additional reserves or 7 basis points of coverage.", "Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-day-plus delinquencies were 4.25% and the net charge-off rate was 5.33%. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.37%. RSAs were up $14 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 3.7% for the quarter, compared to 4.1% last year.", "The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailers sharing in the incremental provision expense, which offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year growth in the programs. Looking forward into 2017 and given the trend so far in the first quarter, we think RSAs will run closer to the 2016 level of around 4.1% to 4.2% for the full year.", "Other income was essentially flat versus last year. Other expenses increased $108 million or 14% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. And the efficiency ratio was 30.3%, slightly lower than the 30.4% ratio last year.", "I'll move to slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.18%, up 34 basis points over last year.", "As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we are holding and have deployed excess liquidities for our strong receivables growth.", "The yield on receivables is relatively flat at 21.2%, down 4 basis points compared to the prior year. Revolve rate improved compared to the prior year, and we received a modest benefit from the increase to the prime rate. However, those improvements were offset by the impact on mix shift due to continued strong growth in lower-yielding Payment Solutions receivables.", "The platform's receivables have grown on average 15%, compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 10% to 11% range over the past year.", "Lastly, funding cost improved by 6 basis points driven by improved funding mix. Our deposit base increased by $7 billion, and was 72% of our funding sources versus 69% a year ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources, so the margin benefited from the shift in the funding mix to lower cost deposits.", "So, overall, we continue to be pleased with our net interest margin performance, with the margin exceeding our expectations for the first quarter. And if the trends we're seeing so far this year continue, we would expect the margin for the full year to be between 16% and 16.25%, which is better than the outlook we put out back in January.", "And lastly, just to reiterate the impact of seasonality on our net interest margin throughout the year, we would expect the net interest margin to come in at the low-end of the range in the second quarter, given we expect to carry more liquidity in the quarter. Then the margin typically increases in the second half of the year and should move towards the higher end of the range, as we deploy liquidity to support the seasonal build in receivables.", "Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. As we noted previously, we continue to anticipate credit to normalize from the levels we experienced over the past couple of years. We expect this normalization to occur over time and is driven by a number of factors, including portfolio and channel mix, account maturation and seasoning, and consumer and payment behaviors.", "In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. 30-day-plus delinquencies were 4.25% compared to 3.85% last year, and 90-day-plus delinquencies were 2.06% versus 1.84% last year.", "Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.33%, compared to 4.74% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. Our outlook for 2017 was for the net charge-offs to continue to normalize into the range of 4.75% to 5%, approximately 25 to 50 basis points higher than 2016.", "Given what we've seen so far, we now expect NCOs to be in the 5% to low-5% range this year, depending on how some of the factors play out. Normalization will continue to be the largest factor and, incrementally, the impact of lower recovery pricing pushes us into this range.", "The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.37% and the reserve build from the fourth quarter was $332 million. While most of the build is related to growth and normalization, the reserve build also reflects the lower recovery pricing we saw in the quarter, which drove approximately $50 million of additional reserves or 7 basis points of coverage.", "Looking forward, based on what we are seeing across the portfolio and assuming economic conditions continue to be stable, we believe that our loss rate will continue to trend higher into 2018, then start to level off in the second half of the year. We expect the net charge-off rate to be in the low- to mid-5% range for 2018.", "Given that expectation as well as continued strong growth, the reserve builds for the next couple of quarters are likely to be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw this quarter. In summary, while credit will continue to normalize from here, we continue to see good opportunities for growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns.", "Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $908 million, up 14% over last year. The efficiency ratio was 30.3%, relatively flat to last year. For the full year, given the strong growth in receivables and the higher expectations on margins for the year, we now expect the efficiency ratio to run closer to 31.5%, which is better than the outlook we provided in January.", "As we've noted in the past, we expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, driven by the timing of the spend on some of our projects.", "Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plans. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.", "Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $7 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 72% of our funding, higher than the 69% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities.", "Longer-term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers.", "In terms of our funding plan going forward, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017. Funding through securitizations was 17% of our funding, consistent with our target of 15% to 20%.", "Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources, within our 10% to 15% target. So, overall, we feel very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources.", "Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18% CET1 under the transition rules and 17.7% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year.", "Total liquidity decreased slightly compared to the prior year to $21.8 billion, which is equal to 24.4% of our total assets. This is down from 27.2% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.", "During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased $238 million of common stock out of the $952 million our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to execute our share repurchase plan, subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.", "I'd also like to provide an update on our 2017 capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the timeline last year, and we hope to be in a position to announce our capital plans in the June-July timeframe. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, we would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks, in addition to supporting our growth.", "Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Before I conclude, I wanted to summarize for you our current view on 2017. Given the strong receivables growth and higher revolve rates we've seen so far this year, we believe the margin for the full year will be in the 16% to 16.25% range, which is better than the outlook we provided back in January. This further demonstrates one of the natural offsets in the business. Some of the same factors driving credit normalization also result in higher receivables yield than we expected back in January. So we are seeing a partial offset on the revenue line.", "Given what we've seen so far, we now expect NCOs to be in the 5% to low-5% range, depending on how some of these factors play out. Normalization will continue to be the largest factor, and incrementally, the impact of lower recovery pricing pushes us into this range.", "Regarding the loan loss reserve builds, given continued credit normalization and strong growth, we believe that reserve builds for the next couple of quarters are likely to be in a similar range to what we saw this quarter. We now think RSAs run closer to the level we experienced in 2016 between 4.1% to 4.2%", "Moving to the efficiency ratio. For 2017, we had expected to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of around 32%. However, given the strong growth in receivables and the higher expectation on margins for the year, we now expect the efficiency ratio to run closer to 31.5%. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, driven by the timing of the spend on some of our projects.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap-up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. While the reserve build impacted our results this quarter, we continued to deliver strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms. We renewed key programs, made strategic acquisitions and launched new programs during the quarter.", "We continued to drive deposit growth and maintained a strong balance sheet. We also returned capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program. We continue to focus on our strategic priorities and believe they will help us generate additional growth and strong returns as we look ahead.", "I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron - Synchrony Financial", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.", "Operator, please start the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from John Hecht from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. Can you hear me?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah, John.", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "All right. Thanks very much. So, just with respect to credit, a couple of questions. Number one is, so if I just do the math relative to our model and it sounds like the dollar increase allowance build is going to be similar to this quarter for the next couple of quarters, it gets us to an allowance range of about 7% relative to receivables. And yet you all are guiding about 25 basis points in terms of charge-off content. So I'm wondering can you reconcile more than 100 basis points build in ALL (20:30) relative to the 25 basis points build in net charge-offs.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Sure, John. I mean, the coverage is obviously driven by a number of different factors, including whatever your growth assumption is. And there that's why we've tried to be as helpful as we can in terms of telling you how to think about it on a dollar basis.", "But as you think about the reserve builds for 2017, they'll continue to be driven by really two factors; growth in our receivables, which we're off to a very strong start this year; as well as the normalization trends that we're seeing.", "So, as you move throughout the year, you also have to factor in the fact that the reserve will start to pick up 2018 as you roll forward. And so the reserve build in this quarter as well as the next two quarters will start to pick up 2018. So we would expect that to be the dynamic really for the next couple of quarters.", "And then as you move into 2018, we indicated towards the back half we expect the credit trends will start to level off and we'd expect the reserve builds to kind of run in advance of that, and the reserve build in 2018 would be more reflective of growth and include a little bit less of that normalization component.", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned \u2013 you gave some specifics about recovery rates, but then you also cited channel mix and so forth. And I'm wondering if you can give a little bit more detail what \u2013 is there growth at certain retail partners that has a different credit mix than maybe you've seen before, or any color on that concept would be helpful.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Sure. I mean, portfolio mix is something that we've highlighted in the past. We've talked about the fact that our underwriting is very customized, and we underwrite differently based on the platform, the program, the channel and the product. So it's really multi-variant, if you think about it, across the spectrum there.", "And so our credit guidelines have been pretty consistent across those areas. But we do underwrite to different loss rates in some of those areas. So, depending on the growth rates that we're seeing in certain segments of the portfolio, mix can be a driver and certainly influences the composition of the vintages and then how those vintages subsequently perform.", "And if you look at it today, today we would have a larger percent of the book in those newer vintages and in those areas of the portfolio that have had higher growth rates really in 2015 and 2016. So, that's driving the dynamic that we're seeing.", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "Right. Thank you, guys, very much for the color.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Hi.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "I guess, staying on credit, when we think about the step-change in the charge-off rate guidance, I just want to make sure, is it mainly the recovery pricing? And I guess, can that recovery pricing change as a result of recovery experience?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. So I would say it's a combination of a couple of things. One is, just based on how we started the year \u2013 and I wouldn't call it a step-change, Sanjay. I would say we were 4.75% to 5%. We're now saying 5% to low-5% range. So we moved it up largely based on how we started the year here in the first quarter and what we're seeing around recovery pricing.", "The recovery pricing itself, it can move around a little bit. We highlighted, I think it was $36 million back in the third quarter of last year. We saw an incremental decline in pricing this quarter. We believe it's driven by a combination of factors, including just the fact that you've got increased supply in the market. As charge-offs start to normalize across the industry, which we've seen, you've got that dynamic. So you've got just increased supply in the market, which we think is impacting the price.", "And then to probably a lesser extent, you've got the costs that some of the buyers have added to improve their processes in response to the proposed new regulations. I think that was probably a little more of a driver in the third quarter of last year. I think the dynamic that we're seeing now is probably a little more supply-driven.", "Look, the one thing I'd highlight is that we run a regular NPV analysis on these sales. And if we start to see more deterioration on the pricing, we may pull back on some of these sales and start to collect on the accounts or other means.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. And I guess when we think about \u2013 one of the questions I get a decent amount is just your reserve coverage and the differences in your reserve coverage relative to your peers. Let's just talk about your reserve coverage rate relative to your peers and how you see that kind of unfolding as charge-offs start leveling off? Does that reserve coverage rate come down?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Sure. So, obviously, it's hard for me to speak to how others reserve. Our reserve is based on our best estimate of the incurred losses that we have in the book at the end of the reporting period. I would say our model is to generally look out over a 12-month window. But our reserve, it includes principal as well as interest and fees. We also have qualitative and other factors that we include in there.", "So, when you add up those pieces, it typically equates to 14 to 15 months of coverage. But as I've said in the past, that is not how we book the reserve. It just gives you some guidepost in terms of how to think of it. It kind of equates to that 14 to 15 months. But we're not targeting that. That's really more of the output and how it ends up comparing to the next 12 months' charge-offs.", "Other than that, we have a lot of good disclosure in the Qs and the Ks that tell you about the factors that we consider and that we build into the models. But, again, it's kind of tough to compare to what others do.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Brian and Margaret. Brian, given this is now the second credit change we've had over the last three quarters, you gave us guidance looking out pretty far over the next, call it, four or five quarters. Like, what gives you the confidence that losses will actually begin to start leveling off in the back half of next year? What is it that you're seeing across vintages that would give us comfort that this could actually start to happen versus another potential to see the losses drift higher beyond your expectations?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Sure, Ryan. I mean part of this is, if you think about our growth, it really started to accelerate in second, third quarter 2015 through the first half of 2016. And that's obviously driving the dynamic that we're seeing here. It's driven by the factors that I've highlighted in the past, portfolio mix, like program, product, channel, all those same components.", "However, when we look at the more recent vintages and how kind of an early read on those, as well as other factors just including things like the growth rates in some of the higher loss areas of the portfolio, that gives us some comfort that losses will start to level off in the second half of 2018.", "So it's really a combination of early read in the more recent vintages from the second half of 2016, as well as we have been growing in certain areas at a very healthy clip here in 2015 and 2016. And just given now that we're comping against some of those really high growth rates, they started to moderate a bit. And so the mix impact that we're feeling there should lessen as we get more towards the back half of 2018.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Two quick follow-ups, I guess. One, as you look at the performance of your more recent vintage relative to the older ones, are you seeing underlying deterioration in, call it, the 2015 versus the 2016? I know that there's some channel mix that obviously weighs on that.", "And then, just to follow-up as to the last question, if you are expecting charge-offs to begin to level off in the back half of 2018, should we expect the reserve to actually to start to begin to level off in the back half of this year or maybe into early next year? Thanks.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah, Ryan. Let me take the second one first. I would expect the reserve to start to level off in advance of what we expect to see on charge-offs. Obviously, your reserve is forward-looking. So I think, not to get too specific about it, but as you start out into 2018, the reserve build should be more reflective of growth and include less of that normalization component that we expect to see for 2017.", "And sorry, Ryan, take me back to your first question.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And just underlying what are you seeing in the subsequent vintages. Are you seeing similar performance, are you seeing worse performance, any color you can provide there?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. I think, consistent to what others are seeing, 2015 and 2016 have higher loss content. I would say back half of 2016 is a little better than first half of 2016 for us. I don't know how that looks relative to others.", "The underwriting box for us has been largely consistent. But if you look at the past couple years, our growth rates did really accelerate in the second half of 2015 and 2016. And those vintages, second half of 2015, first half of 2016, are seasoning at somewhat higher delinquency levels, driven by the factors that we've talked about, portfolio, channel mix.", "But, again, the early read on the more recent vintages gives us some comfort as well as an updated view of the growth rates going forward on some of those higher loss areas of the portfolio, give us some comfort that we'll work our way out of this towards the back half of 2018.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Yes. I had a question about \u2013 there's been a lot of talk about retailer bankruptcies and just wanted to kind of get your sense on, based on your history, how that plays out when a retailer does go bankrupt? How long that process takes?", "And then, secondarily, have you ever had any experiences where another retailer that's not part of your portfolio suffers a bankruptcy and that can lead to sort of a pickup at your retailers. Can you just talk a little bit about the dynamics?", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Sure. So, first, let me start off by saying that when we do a new transaction and we have a mix of retailers on our portfolio, we're always watching the performance of the underlying economics and balance sheet of that particular retailer. But our risk is really with the consumer, not the retailer.", "And so I'd say when a retailer's gone bankrupt, it's their going into bankruptcy where they're going to restructure their debt and kind of come out in the end, and maybe less stores but continue to run the operation, we work very closely with them on that whole process. They usually let us know ahead of time. We work with them.", "One of the things that's important if they're coming out and want to continue operating as a retailer is, the credit card program becomes a very important element of how they drive their growth going forward.", "In a case where they're closing the doors and they're liquidating, in that case, our experience has shown, based on how we operate, that we can liquidate those portfolios profitably. I would say, again, we work really then with the consumer to make sure the consumer understands they're still responsible for the debt. Most consumers understand that, and they end up paying their bills.", "And then on the last question, I'd say I think that is an opportunity. And we've talked to some of our retailers who are strong and seeing some opportunities. As other retailers do go through bankruptcy, we do see pickup, especially in the specialty retailer market, where you'll have some of the recent closures that have happened that help some of our retailers pick up sales. So, that's both sides of the equation that we see.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Morning.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Morning.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I have a question on your commentary around the RSA trajectory. Just wondering if we're going to be continuing to increase reserves. And just to be clear, the reserve build that you did this quarter, I think that was $322 million, and you're expecting over the next several quarters that you'll be adding to reserves around that same level of $300 million, plus, minus. That's what I heard. Let me know if that's accurate. And if that's the case, why is the RSA profit share moving higher as opposed to staying where it is this quarter?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Sure, Betsy. So the reserve build in the quarter was $332 million. And we said for the next couple of quarters, assume it's in that range. So we're not being that precise around it, obviously. We're going to have to adjust to what's happening in the quarter when we record the allowance.", "But in terms of the RSA, for the quarter, we were at 3.7% of receivables, which is well below the 4.4% to 4.5% that we guided to for the year. So you're definitely seeing an offset. You also have to remember that a lot of things were better year-over-year. We had good growth, higher margins, which would have resulted in a higher RSA than we had originally forecasted. However, those improvements were more than offset by the incremental provisions.", "As you think about it for the balance of the year, you have to factor in that in the third quarter we typically hit a high point on the RSA percentage. You typically have lower charge-offs. Just seasonally, yield comes up on the book. And so, when you factor that in, it gets us in that 4.1% to 4.2% range for the year.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then just two follow-ups on that outlook for RSA into 2018. You gave us some of your other 2018 commentary. Maybe you could help us with that one.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. It's really a little early to start giving RSA guidance beyond that. Obviously, you have to take new deals into account, renewals and things like that. So there's quite a bit that could happen here in the back half of the year that could influence that number. So I wouldn't want to start giving 2018 guidance on the RSA.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then you highlighted that RSAs are typically higher in 3Q when the NCOs are tracking down. So are you saying you're expecting normal seasonality to come through into 3Q? Is that something you could give us some color on?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. There's still going to be a seasonal component to the book. I'm not going to range the magnitude or give quarterly guidance on the NCO rate. But that seasonal component we would expect to still be there, both on the top line as well as what we're seeing on credit. So, it tends to be relatively stable in the first half of the year.", "You see charge-offs come down in the third quarter. They tick back up in the fourth. On the margin side, you see yield come up in the third quarter, comes back down in the fourth a bit with the seasonal build in receivables. So we would expect those trends to still play through for the year.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, just lastly on the RSA, so the 3.6% this quarter did reflect some of the share that you had with your retailers for the reserve build that you did in 1Q. Would you be sharing that reserve build that you're doing over the next several quarters with them as well?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. That's just part of how they work. For all the programs where we have an RSA, all of our partners share in net charge-offs and the majority of them share in the reserve build as well. We have a couple of programs where that's not the case.", "So there can be a little bit of a lag in terms of the offset, but, for the most part, they're sharing in that and that's really what drove the RSA percentage down from that 4.4% to 4.5% range that we had guided to down to 3.7% for the quarter.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Great. Thanks. I guess, first, maybe from a high level, could you just talk about what things you're doing differently, if anything, in response to this? Like, are you doing things either to tighten from a credit perspective or from a profitability perspective to kind of mitigate some of these results?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Sure, Moshe. So we're always making refinements to the underwriting models across the portfolio based on the trends that we're seeing. And while I'll say that overall our underwriting standards and the cutoffs have been largely consistent, you see that if you look at the FICO stats (37:45) on the portfolio, which has been pretty consistent for a number of years now.", "But given we're still seeing attractive risk-adjusted returns, we haven't made what I would call significant changes to our underwriting model to tighten up. The changes that we've been making, we'll continue to make, are pretty surgical in nature. They're specific to certain portfolios, certain credit strategies. We're always adjusting things like line assignments, refining upgrade strategies and things like that.", "So, yeah, we tightened a bit in the second half. We'll continue to refine our strategies here as we move throughout 2017. We saw that actually improve some of the performance in the more recent vintages. So, look, we're obviously adapting to what we're seeing as these high growth vintages mature. But I wouldn't say it's anything dramatic that's going to slow the growth rate of the business.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. And then maybe just to come back from a reserving perspective. I mean, you've gotten this question really in a bunch of different ways. But I guess I still kind of struggle, the $50 million that you referred to with respect to recovery pricing, is that something that becomes part of a consistent reserve build? Like, it seems like that should be something that's more or less one-time. And so maybe why is it that you're talking still about reserve builds that are comparable to this level?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Look, the $50 million is one-time based on the market pricing that we got in the quarter. Hard to tell when we go back out if we'll see another adjustment there. We don't have any visibility into that at this point.", "And we're really not trying to be that specific. We're saying, look, assume the magnitude of reserve build for the next couple of quarters will include a component for the strong growth that we continue to have as well as normalization. And that puts the reserve build in the same range as what we have this quarter. But that's about as specific as we can be.", "We're trying to give you a way to think about it over the next couple of quarters. But I can't pinpoint a dollar amount today and tell you what exactly we're going to book in the second and the third quarters.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Right. And I appreciate that. Just a quick comment and that is that you have to appreciate our perspective that the impact of the reserve build is kind of four times as important as an effective change in charge-offs because it's \u2013 and so it puts us in just a difficult position. So, as you go forward, future guidance and information on that would be helpful.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. No, Moshe, we understand that. And the reserve build in the quarter, as we said, was higher than we expected and that's why we're giving you a framework for how to think about it for the next couple of quarters, which is all predicated again on the net charge-off trends that we're seeing, so.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. It's going to be another question on reserve build because I'm still kind of confused about why we're talking about this kind of reserve build. Maybe I misheard your comments. Brian, did you indicate you also expect 5% to low-5% charge-offs for 2018 as well or did I mishear that?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "For 2018, we're in low- to mid-5s. So we do expect the charge-offs.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Low- to mid-5s.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. So we expect the charge-offs to continue to trend up in 2018, leveling off in the back half. So, as you start to build reserves for that, you're picking up more of the 2018 dynamic as well as the fact that we moved our forecast up for 2017 as well.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. So the thing that I'm most confused about then is, if we talk about the same type of reserve build for the next two quarters, you basically added 60 basis points of coverage in one quarter, right? So, if we did that two more times, we'd be at like 7.5% coverage on 5.5% charge-offs at the high-end of that range for 2018. So why are we building so much incremental cushion over kind of what you're guiding to in terms of an 18-month forward charge-offs here?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah, Mark. I think you might be missing the growth component that would bring that percentage down. We wouldn't be in that kind of range on the reserve coverage.", "But you also have to factor in the seasonality, right? The reserve coverage typically increases second quarter, third quarter, and comes down in the fourth quarter. And when you get to the fourth quarter of 2017, your reserve coverage should look largely in line with that low- to mid-5% range of charge-offs for 2018.", "That's just another way to think about it is as you move throughout the year, your reserve coverage at the end of the fourth quarter should reflect what we expect to see for 2018, which is at low- to mid-5% range.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. And then just a question on the seasonality you're assuming in your guidance for this year. As I look back at the last two years, the back-half seasonality was pretty different in 2015 versus 2016. It was much more muted in 2016. So, if I use the seasonality of 2016, I'm getting to like a 5.175% average charge-off for 2017, assuming no incremental upward bias for normalization. Are you kind of implicitly assuming a little bit more pronounced seasonality than we saw in 2016?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. I don't think we're assuming anything incremental on seasonality. That charge-off range would be in the range of what we're indicating in the 5% to low-5% range.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Hey, Rick.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "One of the things that is unique about your portfolio is the idiosyncratic risk associated with the different retailers. And I know that you say that you're tied to the consumer, but there is a utility factor tied to the specific retailers.", "When you look at the recovery pricing that you're describing, is one of the things that's causing the tiering of your sales into the secondary market a function of which retailer portfolios you're selling off?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. We don't think so, Rick. I think it really is driven by the factors that I mentioned earlier. We know for a fact that there's increased supply in the market. You've seen charge-offs normalize across the entire industry. We think that's probably the primary driver this quarter.", "And remember, we're coming off of historically low loss rates. So there was definitely a supply-demand imbalance in 2014, 2015, a little bit into 2016, and now that's started to come back and normalize a bit. And we think that's driving the majority of what we're seeing on pricing.", "And then I think the secondary factor is just buyers have added a lot of cost to get out in front of some of these proposed new regulations and we think that that's probably secondary driver. But I don't think it's specific to anything idiosyncratic or anything related to any of our retail partners.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. In that vein, not only in terms of secondary pricing, but how much churn do you see from a credit performance perspective related to retailers? And again, the question came up before, but I assume in a scenario where a retailer is at risk, the utility of that card to the consumer goes down and that impacts willingness to pay.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. There's definitely some of that, Rick. Typically, if a retailer is going to go through bankruptcy and then liquidate, we usually adjust our reserve modestly to accommodate for that dynamic. But then we always liquidate properly because the vast majority of the consumers want to protect their credit rating. They know they still owe the debt and they pay us back.", "And so we've been through a few of these over our history and they always liquidate profitably, and again, because the consumer knows that they're still obligated on the debt.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's it for me. Thanks, guys.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Thanks, Rick.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ho from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Again on the reserve build, I fully appreciate the commentary, but in terms of the kind of build over the charge-off acceleration, just want to clarify that, again, the $300 million is kind of the incremental reserve build even with the higher guide in charge-offs for next couple of quarters?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "That's right. The higher guide on charge-offs for 2017 and the new outlook we put out there for 2018 inform kind of the reserve build over the next couple of quarters. So, that's exactly how to think about it. You're picking up both 2017, what we expect to see for the balance of the year in net charge-offs, as well as every quarter as we move forward you're picking up another quarter of 2018.", "David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And then in terms of the credit normalization that has accelerated, do you believe that that could slow \u2013 or is that part of your assumption in terms of the leveling off in 2018 in terms of the loss rate guide, that credit normalization, more underlying even if you had adjusted for a portfolio mix and some of the things you're seeing would start to level off maybe if overall kind of consumer leverage and the economy start to scale off as well?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. I mean, all of our comments are based on a relatively stable macro environment. So we're really talking about based on dynamics that we've seen and the vintage curves and the portfolio mix. That gives us some comfort that losses will start to level off in the second half of 2018. But, again, it's predicated on a stable macro environment and nothing really changing there.", "David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then quickly, any late fee benefit from them, just given the acceleration in credit?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. You do see \u2013 that's part of what gave us better yield than we were expecting. It was relatively flat year-over-year, but better than our expectations. And that's what's pushing our guidance on NIM up from, in January, we were at 15.75% to 16% and now we're saying probably 16% to 16.25% in a quarter for the year. So it's a combination and more revolved on the book. It's one of the natural offsets in the portfolio. So, as credit starts to normalize and trend up, that is one of the natural offsets that you'll see in the business.", "David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. So it's not like pricing for lower quality loans, just some of the natural progression of credit normalizations flowing through there. Got it.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. The FICO strats (49:20) have been very consistent. The Q will come out next week and you'll see that they're virtually unchanged compared to the prior year. We still have 72% of the portfolio with 660 score and above, no change from the prior year, 20% of the portfolio is between 600 to 660 score, no change from the prior year and 8% of the portfolio is below 600 score. So those are all very consistent year-over-year. It really is the dynamics that we've highlighted earlier.", "David Ho - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Scharf from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I just wanted to follow-up a little more on recovery pricing. In first off, do you enter into forward flow deals with some of the larger debt buyers?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. We do in some cases, David.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Okay. And as we think about \u2013 this may have been asked by a prior caller, but inherent in your forward-looking loss guidance, we would expect as normalization continues the industry as a whole is going to continue to generate more supply. Are you factoring in additional declines in average pricing on charge-off sales or are you basing the assumption that that $50 million was sort of a one-time event?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. The way we book the reserves is you take all the best information that we have at the time, which is current market pricing, any indications that there is a trend there that is going a different way, and we try and build all of that into the reserve model. So I wouldn't call it a one-timer necessarily because it can always change in the future as we move forward. But we've booked our best estimate for what we think the market is priced for today.", "We've included all of that in our reserves. It will drive \u2013 it's part of what's driving the NCO guidance up a little bit beyond where we were in January, but we've included everything that we're seeing today in the market.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. And when we talk about the market, can you give us a sense for how many sort of approved debt buyers there are on your list versus maybe 12, 18 months ago, because there seems to be a lot of regulatory-driven shake-out in that end of the market and whether that's one of the factors driving the pricing?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. Look, I'm not going to be specific on the number. We've got, I'll call it, a handful of buyers that we've been dealing with for a long time that we're very comfortable with.", "Our mix changes pretty regularly, depending on the dynamics that we're seeing in the market. I think as I've mentioned in the past, we're always looking at the best ways to optimize the value through sales of the charge-off accounts and then collecting through other means. We always run a regular NPV analysis.", "And, look, if we start to see pricing deteriorate further, we may take a different approach and we'll make modifications along the way.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. And maybe just lastly, along the same lines, regarding sort of other means, obviously that would be your in-house collection capabilities and potentially outsourcing to contingency collection agencies. Are the settlement terms that maybe you're agreeing to with already written-off consumers changing as well? I just want to understand definitionally if recovery pricing exclusively refers to the price that the debt buyers are paying or if it also implies maybe lower settlement in full terms with the stuff you work out yourself?", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "It's pretty specific to the buyers.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. Got it. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. One question we get a lot is with regard to retailer health. Margaret, you addressed this earlier, but apart from bankruptcies, it seems like retailers are frequently decreasing their storefronts. I was wondering if you could talk to how that impacts the model for Synchrony.", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Sure. So we've been seeing this for quite a while. The retailers are going through a transformation. But I would say, as per our reading, it's definitely accelerated coming out of the holiday season. And I think, for us, when we look at this for the retailers that we have, when they're closing stores or reducing their footprint, it's usually stores that are not really generating the sales volume that they need, and it also means that our cards are probably not doing as well in those stores as well.", "So I think, for us, what we've been able to do, and we show it in the growth that we've been able to achieve in this last quarter, is while they're going through their transformation, we're going through our transformation of making sure we can really attract those customers through the online channels, whether it's through their iPad or on their mobile phone.", "And, as we indicated in our comments, this quarter, 26% of retail card penetration was online. So we're definitely picking up, I think, more than our fair share of consumers who are not going into the actual physical brick-and-mortar but shopping online. And I think that's really where we have to continue to work with our partners, continue to make sure we have not only the capability, but also the right value props in place, that we're giving the right marketing programs to those consumers to ensure that they're coming back.", "So we're working hard on those things. We purchased GPShopper. We acquired them this quarter. We did that because they've been able to demonstrate their capabilities in helping us enhance what we're driving for our retailers and also helping some of our retail partners build out their mobile assets.", "So I think the shift is happening and probably happening at a little more of an accelerated rate this year, but we're on top of it and one that we think we are well-positioned for as that transformation continues to happen.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. And then, nothing imminent, but I believe you have some significant renewal opportunities next few years. I was just wondering when those conversations typically begin and what the methodology will be to announce or release the status when you have something to say about them.", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. So those conversations go on continually, as our retailers are looking for new ways to do things and maybe different kinds of investments or a different value prop. So we're working them all the time, as evidenced by our renewal this quarter of Belk and QVC and Midas.", "What we would do is, once we close a deal is when we would announce that we won it. But we're working those every day. I think given the state of retail right now, it's incredibly important for us to be the best possible partner we can be for them to really ensure their success and that they feel good about the overall partnership. And hopefully, we're doing that and then we work the renewals into that process as we continue to work closely with them.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Greg Ketron - Synchrony Financial", "Okay. Christine, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks and good morning.", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Good morning.", "Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Thank you for all the color on the reserving and kind of what your thoughts are on that. Could you maybe elaborate in terms of within the portfolio if there are any particular parts of it that are normalizing faster than other? I mean, what you're experiencing is something we're hearing from others. So, I guess, I'm interested in knowing if there's something that you're seeing within the context of consumer credit that's beginning to change maybe more rapidly than we had seen in just a few months ago.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. I think it's pretty consistent, Ken. It's driven by the factors that we've talked about in the past. And if you look at our growth rates, everybody has had a different trajectory around growth by a quarter or two, and if you look at ours, our growth rates really accelerated in the second half of 2015 into 2016. And so those vintages are seasoning at somewhat higher delinquency levels.", "But it's really driven by the fact that we had really strong growth in certain areas of the portfolio that have higher loss rates. When I say areas of the portfolio, I'm really talking about a multi-variant kind of cut where it's a combination of program, channel, platform and product. It's not as simple as just saying it's one program. It's a combination of different things.", "However, as I mentioned, based on the early read of the most recent vintages, given some of the changes that we made in 2016 and continue to make, they're actually performing a bit better. And that gives us some comfort that this is normalization, and it will level off at some point. We think, for us, based on what we're seeing, that's the back half of 2018.", "Again, I think it's still important to point out that we're also getting improvement on yields. So we're still seeing pretty good risk-adjusted returns. Once we get past the reserve builds, then include both the growth and the normalization component that we're seeing now, these are going to be very profitable balances going forward once we get beyond that.", "Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. I appreciate that. I think one of the challenges that we have in the investment community is, as you see these portfolios and credit cost normalizes, understanding ultimately if that normalization turns into something which we may characterize as deteriorating and as you've kind of mentioned there's been a lot of growth across consumer credit for a lot of companies. And we haven't seen anybody really pull back, and it's \u2013 I guess for those of us who have been around long enough, we kind of recognize that the growth tends to lead to the next credit cycle. It feels awfully close to some previous cycles, and I guess I'm kind of curious as to why we're not seeing more companies pull back before...", "Margaret M. Keane - Synchrony Financial", "Well, I think we're in a good macro environment. I think you got to put the backdrop in there, Ken, which is we're in a fairly good macro environment. The consumers are getting stronger. There's confidence in the consumer. Unemployment is getting better. So I think those things certainly play in to the environment that we're in, and we expect that to continue. I don't think anyone is seeing a big macro correction in that area. So, that helps.", "Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "No. I don't disagree with that. I think the problem that we have is that we find that this deterioration is occurring when the consumer is so strong, and that's frankly the problem.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Yeah. I mean, I think part of that, Ken, if you look at the improvement we were getting in 2014 and 2015, it was significantly above our expectations. And if you go back every quarter, we said credit is not going to get better, credit is not going to get better. And I think that was fairly consistent across the industry.", "And so we saw historic lows for a couple of years, and we're starting to come off of that. It's a fairly gradual change. And if you look at \u2013 for us, I mean I can't speak to others, but our underwriting has been pretty consistent. And I'll walk through the FICO strats (1:01:35) earlier, but for the past few years, they've been very consistent, which says that while there's more supply in the market, we've tried to stay pretty disciplined based on the trends that we're seeing and some of the performance of the vintages from 2015 and 2016.", "We're making some modifications. But as I mentioned, they're pretty surgical. I think others are probably going to start to do that as well. But I don't think there's anything that we see at least in the consumer that says, by historical standards, there's a problem there. I think they're still healthy. They've continued to take on more debt, more leverage. But, again, if you look at it over time, it still appears to be fairly responsible. And so we're still seeing a lot of opportunities for growth across the credit spectrum.", "Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Well, thank you for all your comments this morning. I really appreciate it.", "Brian D. Doubles - Synchrony Financial", "Thanks, Ken.", "Unverified Participant", "Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning.

Thank you for joining us today.", "I'll start on Slide 3; the overall fundamentals of the business remain strong in the first quarter with net earnings of 552 million or $0.66 per share. Our growth drivers continued their solid trends helping to drive purchase volume of growth of 10%, loan receivable growth of 7% and platform revenue growth of 5%. We're seeing the impact of compelling new value propositions such as The Sam's Club 531 cash back program which was recently recognized with a PYMNTS.com innovator award.", "Programs like this demonstrate the impact of engaging deeply with partners to help them develop innovative and effective ways to drive sales. Our focus on enhancing value for our partners and cardholders through digital offering has also helped to drive significant increase in online purchase volume. For the first quarter, digital purchase volume increased 18% compared to prior year. I will spend a few moments this morning outlining how our digital, loyalty and analytics capability are bringing value to our partnership. ", "Asset quality improved with a 33 basis point decline in the net charge-off rate and a 30-basis point improvement in delinquency. Expenses were in line with our expectation impacted by investments we made to support the build-out of our standalone infrastructure as well as to help grow the business. We continue to generate solid deposit growth with the process increasing 8 billion or 28% over the first quarter of last year to 35 billion. Deposits now comprise 59% of our funding sources. And our balance sheet remains strong with Tier 1 common capital of 16.9% and liquidity of 14 billion at quarter end. Moving to our business highlights, we continue to capitalize on new business opportunities, forging partnerships across all three of our platforms. We extended our partnership with Amazon and now over 85% of retail card receivables are under contract to 2019 and beyond. We also announced a new Top 40 agreement with Guitar Center, the world\u2019s largest provider of musical instruments and recording equipment which we expect to launch in the second half of this year. ", "Additionally, we launched a new CareCredit exclusive endorsement agreement with VSP, the nation\u2019s largest vision insurance provider. We are excited about these new partnerships and our ability to bring significant value to these relationships. At the same time we still have a meaningful opportunity to driver organic growth and we continue to pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration. Also further progress has been made in our efforts to prepare for separation and we are on track to have the applications submitted to the [FED] in the second quarter. Our plans have not changed with GE\u2019s announcement last week that they are reducing the size of GE capital asset base. We continue to target separation by the end of this year.", "Moving to Slide 4; I want to spend the next few minutes outlining the achievements we have made to expand the value we deliver to partners and customers specifically as it relates to our digital, loyalty and analytics capability. We have long viewed online and mobile as important channels for our business. These channels have evolved considerably over the last several years and will continue to evolve. As customer shopping behaviors have increasingly moved to digital, the importance of credit has solid suite.", "Our digital strategies have helped drive a market increase in online and mobile purchase volume which is up 18% from last year. And nearly a third of our credit applications are done through digital channels. Our mobile capabilities cover the entire credit life cycle from acquisition to servicing to loyalty and payments. Our offerings include MFI which allows shoppers to securely apply for credit on their mobile device and instantly access their approved credit line. We also offer end service which allows customers to pay bills and service their account on their mobile device including obtaining their rewards. ", "During the first quarter we announced that our MFI product will be available to our payment solution customers. Since launching the mobile applications in 2011 we have processed nearly 5 million applications through this channel for our retail card, CareCredit and now our payment solutions platform. We also offer digital cards, our proprietary digital version of our cards that enables in-store count look-up and mobile payments functionality. Piloted in 2014, the digital card leverages geo-locations for authentication and home screen icon for easy access post in moment for participating retailers.", "In March we announced that we extended our digital card to our CareCredit platform enabling access to a digital version of our CareCredit card on their mobile device, since nearly half of all CareCredit purchase line is from existing card holders this was an important initiative. This coupled with our CareCredit online provider locator which received 600,000 hits monthly provides a power tool for increasing repeat purchases in this platform.", "Mobile wallets are an important development in the mobile payment space and we are excited to announce our participation in Samsung Pay leveraging both MST and NFC technologies. Samsung Pay is accepted at 90% of retail merchants and allows our partners and customers to access the unique features and benefits of our cards. As you know we also announced our participation in Apple Pay and we have partners that are engaged with MCX and their currency platform, so we plan to support that technology as well. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships we have developed a mobile platform that can rapidly integrate with mobile wallet while preserving the benefits of our cards. We recently made a strategic investment in GPShopper an innovator developed of mobile apps with a focused on the retail industry. This partnership helps us build on our existing mobile platform to more easily integrate credit into the shopping experience with personalized offers, enhance account serving and loyalty programs.", "We continue to design and launch new loyalty and value propositions for our partners. We are enhancing our loyalty capabilities by leveraging [indiscernible] platform to provide multi-tender loyalty programs allowing us to create a single seamless fully integrated loyalty solution regardless of tender yup.", "Multi-tender loyalty programs were enabling our partners to market to an extend customer base, give our card holders access to a more seamless loyalty rewards program and it allows us to access the additional perspective card holders. Our analytics capabilities are an important component of the value we bring to our partner and customers. Currently, we receive SKU or category level data on over half of all transactions that occur on our network. We offer our retailers actionable analytics, market research and creative services to help them drive sales. Our data access affords us a wide array of opportunities to better analyze card holder spending to understand what they are buying and how they are shopping. We then work with our partners to customize offers that will increase engagement, sales and loyalty. ", "Underlying our ability to provide distinct value to our partners and card holders is our proprietary close loop network. Our private label and co-branded dual cards run on our network which means that the transaction comes directly to us, enabling us to see the date of the purchase, name of the retailer, what brands and items were purchased and the channel through which this transaction occurred in store, online or via a mobile device. The volume of data to which we have access is immense and we've build the capabilities to transform this information into actionable insights. ", "In summary, we will continue to seek ways to build, partner and invest in the latest technologies to further benefit our partners and customers. It's an exciting time in the evolving digital landscape and we\u2019re committed and positioned to continue to deliver value.", "Slide 5 highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Purchase volume was 23 billion, an increase of 10% over last year. This helped to drive non-receivable growth of 7% to 58 billion. Our average active accounts were up to 62 million, a 4% increase from last year. And platform revenue was up 5% over the first quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continued to drive incremental growth for our value propositions and promotional financing offers. ", "On the next slide I will spend a few minutes discussing the performance with each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to give you more details on our financial results. ", "We delivered solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. To our Retail Card platform we offer private label credits cards and a proprietary Dual Cards as well as small business products. The addition of DP which we announced last quarter will bring us to 20 retail card partners nationwide. Our retail card platform accounts for 68% of receivables and 69% of platform revenue. Our retail card performance was strong, with purchase volume growth of 10%, receivable growth of 7% and platform revenue growth of 5%. ", "Renewing and extending our programs has been a key priority in this business. And as I outlined earlier we have been very successful in this regard. And we now have over 85% of our retail card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth. Payment solution which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 15% of our platform revenue is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases primarily in the home furnishing consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power product markets. ", "Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts were up 8% over the same quarter last year, driving receivable growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 8%. The majority of our industries have solid growth in both purchase volume and receivables including home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. We\u2019ve recently signed a new partnership with Guitar Center and extended our Top-40 partnerships with MEGA Group USA a 1,700 member national home furnishings buying group of independent retailers. ", "We also extended our Pep Boys partnerships, a key partner in our CarCareONE auto network. We continue to actively pursue a solid pipeline of potential new partnership opportunities in this platform. CareCredit which accounts for about 12% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue is a leading provider of financing to consumers for [selective] healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology services. Our partners in this platform are largely individual and small group of independent healthcare providers; the remainders are national and regional healthcare providers. ", "During the quarter the majority of our specialty showed year over year growth in both purchase volume and receivable, with dental and veterinary turning the highest receivable growth. Purchase volume and average active account both increased 6%, helping to drive receivables growth of 4% and platform revenue growth of 5% over the same quarter of last year across each of our sales platform we delivered solid performance and continued the momentum of signing new partners, renewing and extending partners and working to drive organic growth. ", "I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter. ", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 7 of the presentation. In the first quarter the business earned 552 million of net income which translates to $0.66 per diluted share in the quarter. Overall, the company continued to deliver strong top-line growth with purchase volume up 10% and receivables up 7%. Net interest income was up 5% compared to last year. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year. ", "Interest income was up 7% which is in-line with our receivables growth. RSAs were up 66 million or 11%, driven by growth in the programs and improved credit performance compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.5% for the quarter consistent with the trends in both 2014 and 2013. We do expect the RSAs to trend just under the 4.5% level for 2015, consistent with what we communicated back in January. ", "The provision declined 77 million or 10% compared to last year. The decrease was driven primarily by improving asset quality trends. There are a couple of things worth pointing out here. First, 30 plus delinquencies declined 30 basis points versus last year to 3.79%. And the net charge-off rates fell to 4.53% which is 33 basis points below last year. Our reserve coverage was fairly consistent compared to the first quarter last year, up slightly from 5.52% to 5.59%.", "Measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs the coverage remained relatively stable at 1.26 times. Other income decreased 14 million versus last year. The main driver here is higher loyalty expense related to the new value propositions we launched in the third quarter of last year. Interchange was up 24 million driven by continued growth and out of stores spending our Dual Card. This is offset by loyalty expense that was up 35 million primarily driven by the new value proposition. As a remainder, we run the interchange and loyalty expense back through our RSAs so there is a partial offset on each of these items.", "Debt cancellation fees of $65 million were down 5 million from last year due to the fact that only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased 136 million versus the first quarter last quarter. Last year's results included a $44 million benefit related to a reduction in reserves for certain regulatory matters. Adjusting for that, expenses were up 92 million or 14%. The remaining increase was due to three main drivers all of which are consistent with prior quarters.", "First, we're making investments to support ongoing growth particularly in our Retail Card program. As many of you are aware, we have completed long-term extensions with many of our large partners and as part of those renewals we set aside more dollars in the marketing and growth funds to support those programs.", "Second, we also launched our new branding campaign in September and continued our marketing efforts with a focus on our deposit products. And lastly, we continue to invest in the infrastructure build as we execute our plan to separate from GE.", "So overall, the business had a solid quarter. We had strong balance sheet growth and good top-line growth generating an ROA of 3%. ", "I'll move to Slide 8 and walk you through our net interest income and margin trends. As I mentioned on the prior slide, interest income growth was strong at 7% in line with our receivables growth. This was partially offset by higher funding cost related to the additional liquidity we're carrying on the balance sheet compared to last year. The net interest margin declined to 15.79%, which was a little better than our expectations. This is due to using some of the liquidity that seasonally builds up in the first quarter to pay down the bank term loan facility and pay off GE Capital loan and I will cover this later when I discuss our funding profile.", "As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, approximately 250 basis point was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $14 billion, which is up $9 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the FED, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets.", "The yield on our receivables declined 34 basis points as a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter compared to the last year and the impact of portfolio mix given the strong growth we're seeing in our promotional offers and payment solutions. As Margaret mentioned earlier, payment solutions grew receivable 11% over the last year.", "Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.9%, up 28 basis points compared to last year. This is in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I'll walk you through our breakdown by funding source.", "First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable, up 9 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor of our direct retail CDs partially offset by growth in our lower rate savings account product. Our deposit base increased over 8 billion or 28% year-over-year. We continue to be very focused on growing our deposit base and making this a larger funding source going forward. Securitization funding costs increased 20 basis points to 1.5%. This is driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of 6.6 billion of undrawn securitization capacity.", "Our other debt costs increased 84 basis points to 3.2% due to the higher rates on the GE Capital and bank term loan facility as well as the unsecured bond. It\u2019s worth noting here that the majority of the new bonds we issued in the quarter are fixed rates, so we have replaced in variable rate funding for longer-dated fixed-rate funding and this will benefit us in a rising rate environment.", "Over the past several quarters, our margin has changed significantly due to the factors I just mentioned. The primary drivers are the liquidity build and the cost of the new funding sources we put in place after the IPO. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primary driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the GE Capital and bank loans. Given we don\u2019t expect a similar benefit in future quarters; we will likely see our margin move back in the 15% to 15.5% range we communicated back in January.", "And next I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 9, but before I get to that I thought it would be helpful to provide some perspective on the seasonal trends and impact allowance coverage from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. As you'd expect we typically see a significant receivables billed during the holiday season. The allowance coverage as a percentage of receivables typically comes down a bit in the fourth quarter as customers pay down a significant portion of the holiday balances in the first quarter and a higher proportion of delinquent accounts don't translate into losses.", "Then in the first quarter as the holiday balances are paid down, you will see the allowance coverage revert back to levels of more consistent with other quarters. As you look back at the 2014 allowance coverage, this will give you a sense for the seasonality. The coverage was in the 5.5% range for the first three quarters, very similar to our result this quarter. So looking more specifically to the first quarter results, as I noted earlier we continue to see stable to improving trends on asset quality, 30 plus delinquencies were 3.79% down 30 basis points versus last year 90 plus delinquencies were 1.81% down 12 basis points. We believe these improvements are driven at least impart by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer. Net charge-offs also improved to 4.53% down 33 basis points versus last year.", "Lastly, the allowance from loan losses as the percent of receivables was 5.59% which increased from the prior quarter for seasonality but was fairly consistent with the first quarter of last year. Another metric you can use to measure reserve coverage is to compare the reserve to the 12 months charge-offs. We\u2019re currently at 1.26 times coverage which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve. This is always fairly consistent with the level throughout 2014.", "So overall we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trend we\u2019re seeing. To give in those factors we believe that our credit trends will continue to be stable.", "Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were in line with our expectations. As I noted earlier last year\u2019s results included a $44 million benefit related to a reduction in reserves for certain regulatory matters. After adjusting for that item expenses were up 92 million or 14%. And this increase was driven primarily by incremental investments in our programs as well as the infrastructure we\u2019re building as part of our separation from GE.", "Employee costs were up 46 million as we added additional employees over the past year to support growth in the business and the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation. Professional fees were up 32 million due to both growth in the business as well as cost to separate from GE. ", "Marketing and business development costs were essentially flat to last year. We continue to invest in our programs and our marketing efforts around our deposit platforms as well as branding. However given the significant success in growing deposit and the excess liquidity in the first quarter we did see an opportunity to dial back some of the marketing cost for deposits. Information processing was up 11 million on higher IT investment and transaction volumes compared to last year.", "So overall our efficiency ratio was 32.2% for the quarter, which is below the 34% target we provided back in January. We continue to believe we have a very scalable platform and while the efficiency ratio will climb modestly from here through the remainder of the year we expect to stay below our target level of 34%. ", "Moving to Slide 11, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy is the continued growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year we\u2019ve grown our deposit by 8 billion primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 59% of our funding; we are well positioned to meet our long-term target of being 60% to 70% deposit funding.", "Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion to $15 billion range which is approximately 24% of our funding. We did issue 750 million of new debt in March, the debt was five year fixed and price at 2.37% which was a little better than we expected given the strong demand. Our unsecured bond offerings have also been well received. In January we issued 1 billion of five year unsecured bonds, 750 million of which was fixed rate and price to 2.7%. The remaining 250 million was floating rate.", "Lastly, I want to highlight some recent developments related to the bank term loan facility and the GE capital loan. First, as we\u2019ve said in the past our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility and GE capital for funding. These are more expensive forms of financing for us and not part of our long-term strategy. ", "During the quarter we made 3.2 billion of prepayments from the bank and GE capital loans, this included 2.8 billion of pro rata payments in January and February and then in March we made an additional $400 million payment on the GE capital loan which paid the loan off in full.", "Since the IPO we have paid down the bank and GE capital loans from 9.5 billion to 5.7 billion today, which is ahead of our original expectation. So we\u2019ve really made a lot of progress on the strategy to reduce a reliance on these sources. So overall we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We\u2019ll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility. ", "Turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 15.9% Tier 1 common under Basel I. This translates to 16.4% common equity Tier 1 under the fully phased in Basel III guidance. And consistent with prior communication we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buyback until we complete the separation from GE, so we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. Post separate we\u2019d expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers.", "Moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to 20.4 billion and is comprised of 13.8 billion in cash and short term treasuries and an additional 6.6 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 28% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR level.", "Overall we\u2019re executing on the strategy that we outlined previously, we\u2019ve build a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity level. And with I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret. ", "Margaret Keane ", "Thanks Brian, I\u2019ll close with the summery of the quarter on Slide 12 and then we\u2019ll begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter we exhibited strong broad-based growth across several key areas, continuing the momentum we've generated over the last several quarters. We continue to make our cards valuable to consumers, retailers and merchants. Notably in the first quarter we announced that our card would be available on the new Samsung Pay mobile wallet. Leveraging the early investment we made in [indiscernible].", "From our business development perspective we continue to win and renew important partnership as well as sign key endorsements and maintain a healthy pipeline of additional opportunities. Our focus is steadfast; we will continue to deliver value to our partners and customers while leveraging strong engagement, innovation and advanced analytics to drive growth. At the same time we remain acutely focused on our preparation from separation from GE and look forward to providing update as we move closer to the finish line. ", "I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. ", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A session. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. ", "Moshe Orenbuch ", "I guess you had 7% growth in receivables and in core platform and across the company, in what is now turning out to be a little bit more sluggish probably industry setting than we had been thinking just a couple of months ago. Can you talk a little bit about how much the industry setting effects that and what might happen if things were to get a little better from a consumer stand point? ", "Brian Doubles", "This is Brian. I think it certainly impacts it a little bit. Retail sales in January and February were pretty soft. They came back a little bit in March; we saw a little bit pickup as well in our sales which is maybe a positive. I don't think it's enough to really read too much into it. If you look at our growth year-over-year certainly the value proposition that we rolled out in third quarter helped us a bit. If you adjust for portfolio exit our active accounts were up 8%. We\u2019re also seeing pretty good purchase volume per active account; it was up 6% versus last year. So that tells you that even though we\u2019re in a relatively weak retail sales environment. Consumers are still seeing real value on our cards and they are spending more on their accounts which is a positive. ", "Online sales were up 18% that continues to be a positive for us, and then if you look at CareCredit and payment solutions specifically as we talked about in the past one of the things that\u2019s benefitting our results here a little bit is just the amount of reuse that we\u2019re getting on the cards. It's the reuse for CareCredit as a percent of purchase volume was about 49%, that\u2019s up 45% last year. So that continues to grow, which is helpful. Payment solutions reuse was 26% which is up a little bit versus last year as well. So a lot of what we\u2019re doing to market to consumers in both of those platforms and create awareness around where you can use the cards is helping. ", "As we said back in January -- we were calling for retail sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, so our 6% to 8% receivable forecast was really based on that. So we didn't really have a lot of lift in the numbers based on retail sales. So I would say they are coming in a little bit below what we expected but not that dramatically off. ", "Moshe Orenbuch ", "Got it. Just on a completely separate topic Brian. You mentioned marketing growth it looks I guess form the slides that the market expense actually flat in that, was it investments in other areas that were part of marketing? ", "Brian Doubles", "There is a couple of things going on there, if you look at just the marketing line, we made continued investments in the program that was offset by lower marketing spend on retail deposits. And so one of the dynamics that you see when you look year-over-year, when we were in the first quarter of 2014 and we\u2019re really ramping up the deposit platform ahead of the IPO we are spending a lot of marketing related to retail deposits. ", "Fast forward to the first quarter 2015 and we were -- we were still growing retail deposits but we were in an excess liquidity position so we saw that as an opportunity to dial back a little bit on the marketing spend related to deposits. So what you really got is incremental investments in the programs offset by lower spend on retail deposits. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. ", "Sanjay Sakhrani ", "I guess I had question on liquidity, understanding you guys want to stay on the conservative side. Could you just talk about how liquidity will ramp or not going forward just based on growth and then maybe how you might be able to reallocate some of the investments that you are investing in towards a little bit higher return type of assets? Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Sure, so it's a little bit -- going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter you're always going to see an increase in liquidity just given the pay down on receivables. So we definitely saw that in the first quarter. We did us about 2 billion of that excess liquidity to make prepayments on the GE Capital and the bank loan, so as you know as we said in the past if we have the opportunity to optimize the amount of liquidity that we're carrying we\u2019re certainly look to do that. I wouldn't think about it going forward, I wouldn't think about a step change either up or down in terms of the absolute amount of liquidity that we're holding on the balance sheet. We're going to continue to run a very conservative balance sheet, we think that\u2019s prudent just given we're still building a track record in the capital markets, we've got rating agency consideration, regulatory considerations, et cetera.", "So I can tell you it\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on. We run lot of internal stress tests. We obviously look at the LCR guidance that's clearly not a constraint for us. We're looking at our maturities coverage and then in quarters where we do think we have an opportunity to use some of that liquidity and take out some higher cost funding and we\u2019ll certainly look to do that. The other thing is that we're looking at -- right now we've got about 40 billion of liquidity, 4 billion of that is in short-dated treasuries, 10 billion roughly is sitting in cash deposits at the FED. We're clearly not earning a lot on that liquidity portfolio. I think that's an opportunity going forward, a great start to move, one may look to do something a little bit different there. We don't have any plans to invest in anything that\u2019s not high quality liquid asset and you\u2019re getting a 100% credit for under the LCR guidance, but there is some opportunity to go out a bit on duration and pick up a little more yield, so you might see us do that in the future.", "Sanjay Sakhrani ", "Okay that's helpful, just a one quick follow-up, it's on the opportunities out there for portfolio acquisitions within the private label area or co-brand area, maybe Margaret you can talk about what's out there. I've heard there is a number of deals up or out for renewal at some point in 2016 through 2017, do you guys have eye an on those as well? Thanks.", "Margaret Keane", "So actually we see that our pipeline is pretty strong. I think we've mentioned we invested in additional business development resources and we've really kind of aligned ourselves around the three platforms, so I would say from a pipeline perspective in all three platforms we feel pretty good. I would also tell you that we're seeing opportunities in really two key areas; one is the first one you're saying which is portfolios that are up renewal; that are with competitors that we can go out after; and then the second is startup trust. So I've mentioned in the past that we like startups, many of our big portfolios that we have today were actually startups. So I think the team is diligently focused on growth. I think for us the really opportunity is really insuring that we pick those portfolios that really work for us. As we've said in the past, we have -- the biggest opportunity is really in organic growth. So as we continue to focus on organic we can be a bit choosier on the portfolios we go after to make sure they really aligned with the returns we're trying to achieve for the overall business.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "I just had a question on credit, the provision I think came in the low-end of expectations and your delinquency trends continue to show improvement and Brian I think you've said your outlook is for relatively stable, but how should we think about the trajectory of provisions for the remainder of the year? Should we expect to see losses show any further improvement and could we actually start to see some -- the level of reserves coming down a bit just given the positive improvement in credit losses?", "Brian Doubles", "I think, as I've mentioned, the charge-offs for the quarter 30 plus, 90 plus were probably little bit better that we expected. We do we're getting a little of the benefit here on lower gas prices, improving employment helps, but it's really -- it's one quarter so it's hard to draw a much of trend from it at this point. The studies around gas prices say the consumers are -- they're using 25% of those gas savings to reduce debt. We definitely feel like we're feeling a piece of that in the numbers that's why you see the reserve coverage is held pretty stable. We didn't make a big move up or down, it's 5.59%, it was really more or less flat to where we trended all last year; up a little bit for seasonality, but very consistent to where we were last year. So I don't think -- we're not seeing anything absent a little bit of improvement from gas that would prompt us to call anything other than we think we\u2019re in a pretty stable environment right now and we don't see losses creeping up in the next 12 months, we don't see them getting a lot of better from here, add to that the significant change on gas prices.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it and then just on your comment Brian about the [NIM] moving back into the 15% to 15.5% range, does that assume any further pay downs to the term loan and could we end up seeing more term loan paid down and maybe replace that with deposits so we could actually see if the [NIM] maybe running above the top end of the range? ", "Brian Doubles", "We had kind of the base plan that assumed a certain level of prepayments on the bank loan. So that\u2019s already -- a portion of that\u2019s already incorporated in the guidance that we provided back in January. Now in the first quarter we had an incremental opportunity to what we originally forecast and we took advantage of that in the quarter. We don\u2019t see anything incremental to the plan right now, but if we were to find ourselves with excess liquidity again you know our strategy is to make some additional prepayments if we can. The bank term loan facility runs out until 2019, we\u2019re obviously going to prepay it well in advance of that maturity. And we\u2019ll just kind of go quarter-by-quarter here and see if we can lean into it a little bit more.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. If I can squeeze one quick one, last one in there. Margaret just given what we\u2019ve seen across the industry competitively you guys simply in a very good position in terms of your maturities, your partnerships but has here been any consideration to trying to extent some of your bigger partnerships to locking the relationships?", "Margaret Keane", "I think we mentioned that we actually have locked in many of our relationships as we were going through the IPO process and into this year. So we\u2019re always looking at ways to extend our partnerships and usually pumping pops up along the way whether it\u2019s a new product they want to roll out or maybe a different value prom. So it\u2019s kind of how we run the business. We\u2019re always looking at ways to really expand and expand the relationships. Right now we feel pretty good where we are, 85% of the retail card relationships are locked up 2019 and beyond. We just did Amazon which was a really nice win for us. There are couple of more we\u2019re working on. So I think this is kind of how we run the business and always looking to see how we can lock those up for a longer term.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht ", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A little bit -- talk to Moshe\u2019s question on growth; is there any way to attribute either the loan growth or the purchase volume growth to increase penetration in various accounts versus average balance trends at the customer level? ", "Margaret Keane", "I would say if you look at the industries or the platform themselves we actually saw a very nice growth in our payment solution business and a lot of that was actually attributed to things related to housing, where we saw good and solid furniture sales, our auto business as well in that vertical as well. So I think the positive is that it seems like consumers are back spending on their home and reinvesting in their home; so we see that a positive trend. I\u2019ll turn it over Brian and see if he would add anything else on penetration. ", "Brian Doubles", "I think the [indiscernible] thing might just be helpful to describe a little bit how we measure our platforms. So if we take retail card we start at the beginning of the year with a sales plan for the retailer that we work with them on and then we measure those retail programs based on gaining penetration. So if the retailer is growing 2%, we\u2019re looking to grow sales on our card at least 4% to 6% and that\u2019s how we measure ourselves. So if you think about how we built the plan, I would assume generally retail sales 2% to 3% and purchase volume for us was 10% and the delta there is largely tender shift from general purpose card, other payment types onto our card.", "John Hecht ", "That\u2019s great color, thanks. Little bit of homer question that I know I can get from the 10-Q but if you have it handed, do you have the net charge-offs on cards versus installment loan versus commercial credit handy?", "Brian Doubles", "I don\u2019t think we report that separately. ", "John Hecht ", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Brian Doubles", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. ", "Don Fandetti ", "I guess at this point the most probable scenario is you would be regulated as a savings in loan, is there are any chance that you would have to go through formal [CCAR]? And then can you talk a little bit more specifically about a targeted payout ratio as the card issuers tend to have much higher payout ratios for the banks?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, Don you\u2019re right we\u2019ll be regulated as a savings and loan holding company so we\u2019re not technically subject to [CCAR]. It will be up to the FED on what they want to put us through. I can tell you though that we\u2019ve been preparing this we\u2019ll be subject to [CCAR], so we\u2019re running the same stress test, using the same assumptions, building the same models. We\u2019re putting in the same governance processes around our stress test and our capital plan. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re preparing. We do think that whether not we\u2019re subject to the formal [CCAR] the FED is very likely going to regulate us just like they regulate similar banks of our size. So that\u2019s our plan. ", "Don Fandetti ", "Okay. ", "Brian Doubles", "In terms of payout ratio expectation I think there is a couple of things, obviously we don\u2019t report anything publically on our stress test so it\u2019s tough to get into a lot of detail, but there is a couple of things to think about. First we\u2019re starting up with very strong capital levels and we reported close to 17% Tier 1 common. Business generates very strong returns; the business model is fairly resilient in the stress similar to what you see from the other credit card peers. So we think we perform in a very similar fashion and overtime we would expect to have payout ratios that look very similar to our peers. Did you have one other question?", "Don Fandetti ", "Yeah Brian, thank you. Margaret is there any update on potential general purpose card issuance and then maybe other additional businesses given the success of your bank so far?", "Margaret Keane", "I didn't hear the second part. ", "Don Fandetti ", "In terms of any other potential products that you may look at given the bank success in the [indiscernible]. ", "Margaret Keane", "So we've mentioned in the past that we would like to launch a general purpose Synchrony Financial Card to our bank. The teams are evaluating that and working on it, that will probably be more of a 2016 launch than 2015 launch, but the teams working on that. In terms of other products I think we said we are really looking at the bank platform as a way to launch some other products, like checking, debit, bill pay. So that\u2019s another whole area that team is working on, again I think that will be more over 2016 launch. But plans are in place for that and the teams are hard at work figuring out the right way to do that. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Just two questions, one was on the [NIM] pressure that came from receivable yield and I know you highlighted that that was imparted from growth in promotional balances. So just wanted to a sense of how you are thinking about promotional balances, is it little bit more seasonal in the first quarter or should we anticipate a ramp as we go through the year? Just a little on how you are thinking about that.", "Brian Doubles", "I would -- we tied it to a promotional balances, it\u2019s really driven by Payment Solutions just having a really great quarter and lot of growth year-over-year, they were up 11%. And if you look at Payment Solutions yield just compared to the average product portfolio or compared to CareCredit or Retail Card it is a lower yielding book. So that\u2019s the biggest driver. I wouldn't assume a ramp or seasonality in that, Betsy, I think Payment Solutions growth is just a little bit better than we expected, which drove a little bit of that yield decline. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay.", "Brian Doubles", "And then the other factor that did have an impact in the quarter was just -- we did see some higher payment rates, lower delinquencies that obviously has an impact on yield as well. So those are really the two drivers. ", "Betsy Graseck", "So high quality problems?", "Brian Doubles", "It\u2019s a high quality problem, we agree.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay and then separately on the plan of shifting more private label card to Dual Card. Could we please talk a little bit about plans and strategies and rollout for that and should we be bake in an acceleration in the model?", "Margaret Keane", "I wouldn't bake in an acceleration. I think what we are always looking to do is look at growth both from our private label and Dual Card. One of the things we are always looking at is getting more of our partners to participate in the Dual Card and there is still some opportunities there that we are working through. Dual Card definitely is a positive for us in terms of driving growth on the overall portfolio and the other positive it gives us is when we can offer both products in a partnership, a private label and Dual, if we were to hit a cycle or bump, we can always just shift to getting out more private label credit cards to ensure we get the customer card in their hand but really protect us on the backend from losses. So that kind of our strategy and how we think about Dual Card. ", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay and you get some nice [indiscernible] on a Dual Card as well. So again just thinking out loud about how to model that, should we take in -- kind of growth rate that you have been generating recently? Or do you anticipate that there is going to be an acceleration, and I guess your point is more steady state acceleration. ", "Brian Doubles", "This is a strategy that we've had in place for four years where we start consumers up with a lower line on PLCC and we upgrade them overtime, and that strategy has been pretty consistent. If we are going to change that in future and do something bigger we would always come and we will describe it at that point. But it really is something that\u2019s been fairly consistent I would say over the last three or four years. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein. ", "Kevin St. Pierre", "If you could just approach the competition for existing portfolios from a different perspective. There has been a lot of news flow over the past year plus about retailers looking for potentially a credit utility to use a term that American Express put out there. Are you seeing any shift in your conversations or shift in the market towards retailers who are just looking for the best possible returns for themselves or has nothing changed in your mind?", "Margaret Keane", "We haven't really seen a change there. What I would say is that the retailers that we talked to are the partners that we are going after. The number one thing that the retailer really wants is for us to describe how we are going to bring more sales in and how we are going to bring more customers and how we are going to have their customers be more loyal. And they really first start up by focusing on our capabilities and I think things like mobile becoming much more important aspect of their business as well as where we can come in and help them from a data analytics perspective, helping them do the marketing campaigns and really driving sale. We have not seen that shift where they are asking for things what would be outside of the normal things we would in a standard contract. So I haven't really seen any of that in any of the conversations that we've had.", "Kevin St. Pierre", "Okay great and separately, on the deposit platform obviously strong growth year-over-year kind of flattish quarter-to-quarter but as you\u2019ve said, you sort of backed off a bit in the marketing. Do you have any sense or any metrics you could share with us in terms of market share gains either of deposits or deposit growth and how you're faring against other direct deposit gathers?", "Brian Doubles", "We're definitely taking share, I don't have a specific number for you, but our growth rates have far outpaced direct -- other online direct retail program growth rate, and so that continues to be a big focus for us. So we've been very pleased by the growth that we're seeing. I'd say we're also -- the other place we\u2019re really focused is on retention rates and the retention rates on our CDs. We've bought the platform from that MetLife back in January of 2013. Retention rates were around 80%. They are up to 88% today, so there is -- there is evidence that our efforts there are definitely paying off. We rolled out a loyalty program where out deposit customers depending on how much they have deposited with us and how long they\u2019ve been a customer, they get access to travel savings and benefits. And so we think it's a really -- it's a combination of paying attractive rates, getting the right advertising program in place, but then also offering something else as part of the equation and that's what we're trying to do with the loyalty programs that we've rolled out.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.", "David Ho", "Just moving back on the competitive environment, any view on the emerging online lenders and marketplace lenders looking at to obviously just throughout some of your channel like CareCredit and point of sale financings, and also there is obviously more talk about correlation partners in the U.S., do you see that as a threat or maybe on the flipside potentially an opportunity for you guys?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure, I\u2019ll take that, I'll take that separately. So the first one; I would say -- we see competition really holding the way it been through this cycle and our pipeline continues to be strong, so we're feeling some of the pressure that I think others are seeing out there particularly on the bigger transaction. So for us, as I said earlier, our pipeline is really robust, we see it strong in all three platforms and we feel really good about where we're positioned. I think on the coalition question, I think it's a really good question. We have some experience in correlations, we have a network called CarCareONE which actually is a network comprised of our retail partners that are in the auto space if you will, and that correlations actually has turned out to be a very positive for us, we're seeing nice growth in that and that's where your card can be used at multiple paces. So if you have a Pep Boys card for instance you can use it in some of the other retail -- auto retailers that are in that correlation. So we like this concept, it's something that we're evaluating to see, could you expand that into other verticals, is there for instance an opportunity in a home vertical for instance, is something we've been talking about.", "We're definitely keeping our eye on this. I think as consumers shop they continue to look for opportunities rewards and feeling like they need some little lift to shop, so things like creating a correlations and offering rewards across network I think is a really important. In terms of the competition from some of these online [sales], we're really not feeling the pressure from them. I think their products are different, there installment products not revolving. I think Brian mentioned earlier particularly in our CareCredit business, we're seeing multiple reuse of our cards so we've really been able to really gain brand in the market place.", "And then lastly in terms of how they have to sell into the market, they have to actually sell on the -- and the CareCredit space you're actually going dental office by dental office to try to create an overall business and so we've been at this for our 25 years and we think it's going to them a little bit while to catch up to us. So we feel pretty confident about where we're against those competitors.", "Brian Doubles", "Operator, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman", "Margaret, in your operating remarks you had commented about some of the growth in digital referencing to Slide 4, I realized in the footnotes that it says digital is both online and mobile, I was just wondering if you could parse those a little bit, what do you see in terms of the dynamics of mobile versus online -- yeah I think if you could share with us that, that would be helpful?", "Margaret Keane", "It's hard to break that out. We're working on trying to figure out if we can get that metric because to go by a device and so for instance your iPad looks like an online versus mobile phone, so it's a little hard for us to break that out. What I would -- suffice to say, we think a lot of that is happening on, on more of the mobile side and iPad side of things if you will, so little hard to break that out. Needlessness to say, I think all of us now are -- if you could just and by me, how I shop, I think more and more this is a big growth area of us and something that we continue to have to really make that experience for that customer pretty seamless.", "David Ho", "Just one quick one follow up, you say that digital growth was 18% year-over-year, is that a lot or a little, could you give us a reference point as to what it was previously as it accelerated?", "Margaret Keane", "We think it\u2019s a pretty descent, if you look at it compared to what -- there is a metric out there that says overall in the U.S. it grew 15%, we grew 18%; so I think we are beating out what the norm is. So that\u2019s a measure to go on. Again, it\u2019s just continues grows quarter-over-quarter and it\u2019s not only on sales we see it on everything, the number of logins, the number of people who are on M-service now, the number of people who start mobile and only use mobile in terms of M-service. For us it\u2019s just a metric we continue to watch and know that it\u2019s a very important one and one that just continues to grow from all aspects of the platform.", "Brian Doubles", "All right. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning, your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference.

Thanks for joining us today. I will begin on Slide 3.", "The overall fundamentals of the business remained strong in the second quarter, with net earnings of $541 million or $0.65 per share. We drove strong growth again this quarter with purchase volume up 11%, loan receivables growth of 12% and platform revenue growth of 9%.", "We continue to see the impact of offering compelling value proposition, including our Sam's Club 531 cash back credit card program and the Amazon 5% reward program, wherein Amazon prime customers receive 5% back every day on their Amazon store card purchases.", "In addition, we rolled out an attractive new value proposition through a Driver Rewards and loyalty program with BP, a new partner which we have on-boarded this quarter and we also announced a new rewards program through our extension with Chevron.", "Asset quality improved with a 25-basis point decline in the net charge-offs rate and a 29-basis point improvement in delinquencies. Expenses were in line with our expectations, impacted by investments we made to support growth and the build out of our standalone infrastructure.", "Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.2% and liquidity of $14 billion at quarter end. We continue to generate solid deposit growth, with deposit increasing $7 billion or 24% over the second quarter of last year to $38 billion.", "Deposits now comprise 61% of our funding sources within the lower range of our targeted 60% to 70%. Our ongoing efforts to grow deposits and provide increase in value to our depositors, with new features and enhancements are yielding results.", "To improve the online experience for our customers, we recently redesigned our online banking platform, building a new technology such as a responsive web design, so that customers can have the same user experience regardless of which device they use.", "Popular feature such as mobile check deposit, customized email alerts and account balance snapshots are seamlessly integrated into the site. We have also streamlined access to our perks, loyalty and rewards program and completely redesigned our online account opening experience, demonstrating our commitment to bringing value and a great experience to our banking customers.", "During the quarter, we signed new partners across each of our platforms, extending key existing contracts and made technology investments, which are yielding innovative value-added services for our customers and partners. In fact, we were recently recognized by InformationWeek for our innovative mobile solutions across the entire credit lifecycle, ranking 48 on this year's InformationWeek Elite 100, a list of the top business technology innovators in the U.S.", "We were also recognized by CIO Magazine as part of their 2015 CIO 100 award program, which recognizes organizations worldwide that exemplify operational and strategic excellence in IT.", "We announced several new partners; among the biggest were Mattress Firm, the largest seller of bedding in the U.S., Newegg, a leading tech-focused e-tailer and Stash Hotel Rewards, an award-winning loyalty program for independent hotels in the U.S. and Caribbean.", "As I noted, we extended our partnership with Chevron, one of our 20 largest partners. With that, we now have nearly 88% of retail card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. Additionally, we renewed a CareCredit endorsement with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.", "We are excited about these new partnerships and our ability to bring significant value to these relationships. At the same time, we still have a meaningful opportunity to drive organic growth and we continue to pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration across our partnerships.", "The online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business. As customer shopping behaviors have migrated to digital, the importance of credit has followed suit.", "Our digital strategies have helped drive a marked increase in online and mobile purchase volume, which is up 20% from last year and nearly a third of our credit applications are now done through digital channels.", "We have been working hard to ensure that the key benefits cardholders enjoy and the data our partners need are retained when transactions move to mobile devices. The big question with enabling private-label credit cards and Apple Pay has been around whether the capture of valuable transaction data would still occur.", "I am pleased to report that we have implemented a solution that will provide us and our retailers, access to the same level of data on transactions that go through Apple Pay.", "Another key point is that we have developed a mobile platform that can rapidly integrate across retailers and wallets, which will allow us to offer our unique value proposition to Apple Pay users. Benefits such as loyalty and rewards programs and point of sale discounts will be retained for our cardholders.", "We were excited to announce this quarter that we will be among the first issuers to offer private label cardholders the ability to add their cards to Apple Pay, and JCPenney will be the first of our partners to offer its private label cardholders the ability to make purchases with Apple Pay.", "We are also finalizing preparations to enable our private label and Dual Cards in the currency wallet and anticipate the launch to occur later this year and we are in active discussions regarding the integration of our private label and Dual Cards with Android Pay.", "We are pleased with the progress we have made on mobile wallets. The speed at which we have been able to adapt to ensure our cardholders can use our cards and their wallet of choice while maintaining the benefits for both cardholders and our partners speaks to our commitment to being at the forefront of this evolving landscape.", "Lastly, regarding our separation from GE, progress continued in the second quarter and we filed our application to separate on April 30th. The Fed has assigned a dedicated team to us and they have initiated their fieldwork, which we expect will continue through the summer.", "After they wrap this up, we expect that their findings will be submitted to the Board of Governors for a review and decision. We believe that obtaining approvals to separate will be focused on our financial strength and the infrastructure we have built to be a standalone business.", "Slide 4 highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 11%, and average active account growth of 4%. Additionally, the close of the BP acquisition contributed to the growth.", "Platform revenue was up 9% over the second quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing offers.", "On the next slide, I will discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail.", "We continue to drive strong performance across all three of our platforms in the second quarter. Through our retail card platform, we offer private label credit cards and our proprietary Dual Cards as well as small business products. The addition of BP, which closed this quarter, brings us to 20 retail card partners nationwide.", "Our retail card platform accounts for 69% of our receivables in platform revenue. Retail card performance was exceptionally strong this quarter, with purchase volume growth of 12%, receivables growth of 14% and our platform revenue growth of 10%.", "We had strong receivables growth across our partner programs and the addition of BP contributed. However, the majority of our growth continues to be organically-driven. In addition to adding new partners that are a good strategic fit, renewing and extending our programs is a key priority in this business.", "During the quarter, we extended another one of our top-20 largest partners with the renewal of the Chevron contract, and now nearly 88% of our retail card receivables are under contract through 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the engaged partnerships we have developed, provide a solid foundation for future growth.", "Payment Solutions, which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 15% of our platform revenue is the leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, primarily in the home furnishing, consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power product markets.", "This platform also delivered another quarter of strong performance with purchase volume and average active accounts, each up 8% over the same quarter last year. This drove receivables growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 7%.", "The majority of our industries had positive growth in both, purchase volume and receivables, including home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. Both, acquisition and renewals are also important in this business. We have had a lot of success in these fronts with the announcement of new partnerships such as Mattress Firm and Newegg, as well as a number of program extensions.", "CareCredit, which accounts for about 11% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, and vision and audiology services. Our partners in this platform are largely individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers. The remainders are national and regional healthcare providers.", "Purchase volume was up 9% and average active accounts increased 6%, helping to drive receivables growth of 5% and platform revenue growth of 8% over the same quarter of last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties.", "In addition to the important endorsement, we renewed with American Society of Plastic Surgeons, we also announced a new CareCredit partnership with Vets First Choice. With this program, CareCredit cardholders will be able to use their cards to pay for online purchases of pet medicines and diet food products at more than 10,000 veterinary practice websites nationwide.", "Each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the signing of new partnerships and the extension of existing programs while driving organic growth.", "I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 6 of the presentation.", "In the second quarter, the business earned $541 million of net income, which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase up 11%, platform revenue up 9% and receivables up 12%.", "Overall, we are pleased with the growth we are seeing across the business. We saw increases in both, purchase volume per active account as well as our average balance per account. These are both good indicator that our value propositions are resonating with consumers and they continue to see real benefits when they use our cards.", "We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the quarter, which was a little ahead of schedule. Net interest income was up 7% in the quarter. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year.", "Interest income was up 9%, which is in line with our average receivables growth. RSAs things were up $31 million or 5% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.1% for the quarter, which was fairly consistent with the second quarter last year.", "Going forward, we would expect RSAs as a percentage of receivables to move back in the 4.5% range for the balance of the year. We typically see RSAs as a percentage of average receivables trend higher in the third quarter as seasonally lower charge-offs lead to a higher RSA level.", "The provision increased $59 million or 9% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth. The key asset quality metrics improved compared to last year, 30-plus delinquencies improved 29 basis points versus last year to 3.53% and the net charge-offs rate fell to 4.63%, which is 25 basis points below last year.", "Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter last year to 5.38%. Measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.27 times. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.", "Other income increased $8 million or 7% versus last year, driven by strong growth in interchange revenue and a pretax gain of $20 million from two portfolio sales. This was partially offset by higher loyalty and rewards costs associated with program initiatives.", "Interchange was up $31 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $31 million, primarily driven by the new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.", "Debt cancellation fees of $61 million were down $9 million from last year; due to the fact that only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $8 million versus the second quarter of last quarter, primarily driven by growth in the infrastructure build, partially offset by a consumer remediation expense last year.", "We continue to make investments to support ongoing growth across all platforms and also had expenses related to the launch of the BP program, the EVM rollout, higher marketing in our programs and technology to support our mobile wallet strategy.", "The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 33.5%, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, we had a solid quarter with strong top-line growth generating an ROA of 2.9%.", "I will move to Slide 7, and walk you through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income growth was strong at 7%, interest and fees on loan receivables was up 8%, partially offset by higher funding costs related to the additional liquidity we are caring on the balance sheet compared to last year.", "The net interest margin declined to 15.77%, which was slightly better than our expectations. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, 207 basis points was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio.", "We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $14 billion, which is up $7.5 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the fed, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets.", "The yield on our receivables was relatively stable, down three basis points compared to last year. This was a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter compared to last year. Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%, up 20 basis points compared to last year. This was in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I will walk you through a breakdown by funding source.", "First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable, up 10 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor [ph] of our direct retail CDs, partially offset by growth in our lower rate savings account product.", "Our deposit base increased $7 billion or 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 61% of our funding, which is in line with the target we set of between 60% and 70%.", "Securitization funding cost increased five basis points to 1.5%. This was driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of $500 million of undrawn securitization capacity. Our other debt costs increased 68 basis points to 2.8%, due to the higher rates on the bank term loan facility as well as the unsecured bonds.", "While the second quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Looking ahead, we continue to expect that our margin will move back in the 15% to 15.5% range in the second half of the year.", "Next, I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 8.", "As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.53%, down 29 basis points versus last year. 90-plus delinquencies were 1.52%, down 13 basis points. We believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends.", "Our net charge-offs rate also improve to 4.63%, down 25 basis points versus last year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.38%, which was down 10 basis points from the prior year. If you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we are currently at 1.27 times coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve.", "Overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends that we are seeing. Given those factors, we believe that our credit trends will continue to be stable for the balance of the year.", "Moving to Slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were in line with our expectations. While reported expenses increased 1% versus last year, as I noted earlier, we did have a $42 million consumer remediation expense in the second quarter of last year.", "Adjusting for this, expenses grew 7%, which is more in line with our receivables growth, but also included expenses associated with the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation from GE, as well as startup cost to launch the BP program and our EMV rollout.", "More specifically, the largest driver of the increase in expenses were employee costs, which were up $43 million as we added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business.", "Professional fees were up $11 million due to both, separation related costs and growth. Marketing and business development costs were up $11 million as we continue to invest in our partners' program growth as well as marketing associated with our direct deposit products.", "Information processing was up $21 million, driven by higher IT investment and transaction volumes compared to last year.", "Other decreased $78 million versus prior year, primarily driven by the consumer remediation item I mentioned earlier as well as the GE cost allocations last year that were replaced by expenses in other categories", "The costs associated with the infrastructure build are now largely reflected in our run rate. While we will have incremental expense in the second half of the year related to growth in the EMV rollout, as well as investment in our digital capabilities, we expect our efficiency ratio will be in line with our annual guidance of below 34% for the year.", "Moving to Slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable and attractive source of funding for the business.", "Over the last year, we have grown our deposits by $7 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 61% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded.", "While we have now moved within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later next year such as checking and bill pay capabilities.", "Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion the $15 billion range, which is approximately 23% of our funding. As we have said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business.", "We have continued to pay this down during the quarter making a $500 million prepayment on May 5th. Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $5.2 billion today. We also completely paid off the $1.5 billion GE Capital loan last quarter.", "Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources; we will continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.", "Turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 17.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 16.4% CET1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules.", "Consistent with prior communications, we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buybacks until we complete the separation from GE, so we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. Post separation, we would expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers.", "Moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to $19.8 billion and is comprised of $13.7 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 26% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.", "Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously, we have built a very strong balance sheet with diversify funding sources and strong capital liquidity levels.", "With that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks Brian. I will close with the summary of the quarter on Slide 11, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call.", "During the quarter, we exhibited strong growth across several key areas, making progress on several fronts and continuing the momentum we have generated over the last several quarters. We continue to make our products valuable to our retail partners, merchants, providers and consumers by enhancing our capabilities, developing compelling value propositions and creating innovative technologies such as our digital wallet capabilities. We are happy to see our digital wallet strategy take hold, we will be one of the first issuers to offer private-label credit cards and Apple Pay, and we recently launched our BP Dual Card in this digital wallet.", "We continue to win and renew important partnership and maintain a healthy pipeline of additional opportunities and we are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast-growing deposit platform. With the application now filed, we look forward to providing you updates as we continue to move closer to our separation from GE.", "I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Mark DeVries", "Yes. Thank you. First question, I am interested to get any updated thoughts you may have on whether you will be included in the CCAR process following the separation from GE.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure Mark. This is Brian. We are not technically subject to CCAR just given our charter. We are a savings and loan holding company, not a bank holding company, so we are not technically subject to CCAR.", "With that said, we are certainly preparing is therefore going to be subject to the same oversight by the Fed, the same processes, so when the CCAR scenarios come out, we run those scenarios, we are developing our models in such a way that we believe they are CCAR compliant and meet the regulators' expectations.", "That is how we think about, governance of our capital, so we are building those processes, but it is unclear as of right now as to whether or not we will be formally subject to CCAR. Obviously, that is part of the application and the approval to separate. The Fed can subject us to CCAR or something that looks a lot like it, so that is how we are preparing.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay, but no communication yet from them on whether they seem inclined to do that?", "Brian Doubles", "Well, we can't comment specifically on our discussions with our regulators, but I think what is important here is, we are preparing is therefore going to be regulated just like other banks of similar size. You know you should assume that whether it is through CCAR or another means that the Fed is going to regulate our capital levels in a similar way.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Fair enough. Then for Margaret, do you have any sense for when Amazon may start to more aggressively market the new 5% cash back rewards for prime customers? I got to tell you I am an active prime customer and I had to find out about the offer through Greg, so they are clearly not doing a great job of getting it out there.", "Margaret Keane", "He is our great marketing guy. Isn't he? Yes. We rolled this out a couple of weeks ago and I think with any new offer, we really want to make sure that the offer is working. Obviously, the prime customer is an incredibly important customer to Amazon, so working jointly together with them, we wanted, one, to make sure the offer was working, two, that all of our processes and Amazon's processes were working really well to really give the best experience to the customer, so I would stay tuned. The plan is for this to be a big part of what Amazon is looking to do in the future. Obviously, as we said it is a great offer, so we are pretty excited about the potential.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht", "Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. One question, I think you said, you purchased the BP portfolio in the quarter. Can you tell us what the dollar amount of that was? In addition to that, when should we see the impact of the new partnerships in the BP coming into the receivables volume?", "Brian Doubles", "Sure John. We acquired BP towards the end of May, so it is in the EOP, but you do not have a full quarter's worth of purchase volume. I can't give you the exact size of BP. I can't disclose it, but I can tell you that our entire oil and gas portfolios are less than 3% of our receivables, so that will give you kind of an upper bound. That includes BP, Chevron, P66.", "John Hecht", "Okay. Great. Then I wonder if you guys can give us maybe an update of the prioritization of your deployment of excess capital once the split-off is complete and you either go through a CCAR-like process or at least work with the regulators to determine appropriate capital levels.", "Brian Doubles", "Sure. The prioritization has not changed. Organic growth is first and foremost the top priority along with portfolio acquisitions. We think that we have got a robust pipeline in all three of our platforms. We will continue to look to bring on new relationships. We brought on the BP portfolio, we just talked about we announced MattressFirm, which we think will be a great deal for us. That is going to launch in April of our 2016, so we will continue to compete and try and grow the business organically, so that is first priority.", "Second priority would be to establish a regular dividend and share repurchase program. Then I would say lastly, we will look at M&A. We are always looking at M&A opportunities. I will tell you, we will be a lot more disciplined around M&A compared to the other three alternatives as a use for capital just given the risk profile.", "I think if you see us do something on the M&A front, it will most likely be a very close adjacency to what we do today, so it will be something that will help us build out our capabilities, help our partners drive incremental sales in the programs, so that type of acquisition opportunity.", "John Hecht", "Great, appreciate the color. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow ups related to separation. In terms of the costs, I know at the end of the first quarter, there was about an incremental $40 million of annualized costs still to come. Did that fully make it into the second quarter run rate or is there still an incremental portion in the back half?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. I did make it into the second quarter, so you should assume that the second quarter reflects kind of the end of that infrastructure build cost, so that is in the run rate of the second quarter.", "As you think about the second half as I mentioned earlier, we are going to have - there will be some incremental cost in the second half, but not tied to the infrastructure build. We are going to complete the rollout of EMV.", "You typically see marketing expense increase in the second half of year, so we would expect to see that again this year, so you are going to have those types of things that happen in the second half of the year, but I would not expect anything material incremental on the infrastructure built.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Has anything changed in your view about the $470 million sort of sustainable incremental post-separation cost?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. If we look at what is in the second quarter run rate, we came in very close to that estimate that we provided last year.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "To the extent that the timing of the approval comes later than the year end, does that have any meaningful implication for your cost base?", "Brian Doubles", "No. It does not.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Brian Doubles", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citi.", "Don Fandetti", "Yes, Brian. A couple questions on interest rate sensitivity. It is my understanding that your estimates for rate sensitivity do not include any pass-through of higher funding cost to the retail. Can you talk a little bit about your ability to push some of that through specifically in your retail partnership business?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure. Don, you are right. The shock scenarios that we publish, and there hasn't really been a change to those. We are still mildly asset-sensitive, so 100 basis points shock interest rates takes our net interest income up about $75 million, which is less than 1%, so that profile has remained relatively consistent.", "We do have the opportunity in some of our agreements to pass-through higher funding cost. I will tell you that each one of these agreements is different, so I cannot give you a rule of thumb, because every deal works a little bit differently, but generally you should think about the deals working similarly and the fact that we calculate an after-tax return, funding cost is typically a component of that as well as credit costs and revenue and all the other P&L line items. We earn up to a hurdle and we share above that hurdle, so that dynamic holds true for the most part on interest expense, but every deal does work a little bit differently.", "Don Fandetti", "Okay. Then secondly, can you talk about loan growth expectations, I may have missed it, but I did not hear guidance discussion.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter. I think, we are performing ahead of where we thought would be back in January, so we are very happy with the growth that we are seeing so far.", "I think the results are particularly good considering retail sales overall were somewhat sluggish. Retail sales in the second quarter were up 1.7% year-over-year and our purchase volume was up 11, so we are very encouraged by what we are seeing so far this year.", "In terms of the remainder of the year, you got a couple of big factors that you have to take into account. We have got back-to-school. That will give us a good indication on how consumers are spending.", "We have obviously got the holiday season that will largely determine where we end up for the year, but generally the growth trends are all moving in the right direction. We look at purchased volume. Proactive account was up 6%. We saw an increase in average balance per account as well, so those are both good indicator that consumers are seeing real value on our cards.", "You know Margaret mentioned that online sales were up 20%. The other thing that we should just highlight, we have talked about in prior calls the reuse that we are seeing in both CareCredit and Payment Solutions. CareCredit reuse was at 50% for the quarter that is up from 47% a year ago and payment solutions reuse was 27%. That is up from 26%.", "You know breakdown the quarter and look at the growth trends, they are all moving in the right direction and we are really pleased with where we are for the first half of the year.", "Don Fandetti", "Got you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi. Good morning.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning, Betsy.", "Betsy Graseck", "We have talked in the past quite a bit about mobile and I know you are doing a lot on mobile for the card and the reward programs that you have. I am just wondering are you also thinking about developing mobile products for the deposits business, your overall banking business as well?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes. Actually in my opening comments I mentioned we have a new mobile platform, so we just rolled that out, so we took the learnings and capability we have on our card side and rolled it over to the mobile platform for our deposit customer and that is going extraordinary well, so the ability to open an account on a mobile phone is much better than it was and we have added a whole bunch of features on the mobile phone and we will continue to build that out as we add additional products.", "Betsy Graseck", "Clearly your cardholders could also be managing their payments through deposits they have with you.", "Margaret Keane", "Most of what they have with us is CDs and savings product. I think, as we move to adding checking accounts later next year that will be a definite positive there.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. Then just one kind of ticky-tacky question on credit trends, I think you mentioned, Brian, that you expect credit trends to continue to be stable for the balance of the year. I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood, are you talking about ratios or dollars?", "Brian Doubles", "More ratios, you know, credit is going to grow in line with growth in receivables, but we would expect the ratios to hold pretty consistent. We have said that all year. I think in the first and second quarter credit in a little better than we expected, we think, primarily driven by lower gas prices.", "Betsy Graseck", "Right.", "Brian Doubles", "It is just a little unclear how much of that is going to continue, but I think everything we look at still feels like credit will be stable.", "Betsy Graseck", "Right, so NCO ratios stable and provisions moving up with balances as you do the reserve build associated with the balance growth?", "Brian Doubles", "That is exactly right. We would expect to continue to build reserves for the new receivable growth.", "Betsy Graseck", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Good morning, Margaret. Good morning, Brian.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning, Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "Maybe a question on a comment you made, Margaret, about a healthy pipeline for additional opportunities for business wins. When I look back historically, I think somewhere around 200 to 300 basis points of loan growth has been added via portfolio purchases, can you just talk about your appetite for further portfolio acquisitions at this point for maybe the next 6 months to 12 months?", "Given that you have added a couple of start-up programs over the past couple of quarters, how much capacity is there to add more of those?", "Margaret Keane", "The first thing I would say is, we have an opportunity to continue to grow organically, so I would start out by saying we can really be selective about what we go after. You know, our appetite to grow with new acquisitions whether it is an existing portfolio or a start-up is very strong.", "We reorganized our development team well over a year ago. We now have very dedicated resources in all three platforms, so we have a very healthy pipeline that we are looking at and it is really great to have a mix between existing portfolio and start-ups.", "Some of our biggest programs today were start-ups, so we are very bullish on start-ups. We know how to do them. Obviously it takes a little bit of time to get them to grow out of the gate, but once you get that engine going it really takes off, so we are very focused on both, driving the organic side, but more importantly, winning new opportunities in the market.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Then if I could just ask a follow-up on, related to split up on a comment that you made. I think you mentioned, Margaret, that there is an on-site team and they were going to submit something to the Board.", "Can you just help us understand, you know, the process from here? What should we be looking for in terms of milestones? Obviously, they are going to make their presentation and then how should we think about the timing of that?", "Is it a back and forth dialogue? If you were to think about areas where you could potentially have concern that could cause us to delay into 2016, what would some of those concerns be?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes. Overall, I would say, the team is on the ground. I can't really comment on the specifics, but I would say it has been a very good process. I think, you all know that we had done a pre-application well over a year ago and got very good guidance through a pre-application process of things we had to focus on.", "Obviously, we would not have filed the application if we did not think we were ready. Brian already mentioned that the cost of the infrastructure is already in our second quarter, so we feel that the things that we needed to focus on, corporate governance, risk management, our whole capital planning process, you know, model developing government and you know, IT infrastructure, which was a big one, are in place.", "They are in here, they will work through the summer. The question then becomes how quickly can a write-up their recommendation. Then it goes to the Board of Governors, which it is a little open to how that process is going to work, whether they do it in an existing meeting or they have a separate meeting, but our view right now is we are still targeting the end of the year.", "I think if it does slip into the first quarter, it really is just around the ability of the fed to get through everything that they have, the application is fairly significant, and getting this in front of the Board of Governors in the right timeframe, and I will have Brian comment a little bit about the timing at the end of the year, because we have certain windows, we have to do this within.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Our expectation, Ryan, would be that we receive the approval that will be public. Very shortly thereafter, we would launch the exchange offer. We do have to manage around earnings blackout period for us and for GE, so there are specific windows that we can target for the exchange offer.", "It has got to be open 20 days. It could be extended another 10 days, so those are the things that we are managing as we look at when exactly we could get this completed.", "Ryan Nash", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.", "David Ho", "Good morning. Just circling back on the loan growth from Dual Card, I know it is about 20% to 25% of your receivable balances. How quickly is that growing relative to the non- Dual Card portion of your portfolio?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Dual Card growth, we do not break it out specifically, but it is growing and it will always grow faster than private-label credit cards. Let me just spend a minute and explain the dynamics there.", "We have, what we call, loan growth strategy. We start new accounts out with a smaller PLCC line. We increase that line over time as they demonstrate payment behavior and we get more comfortable with the credit worthiness of that consumer.", "Then ultimately, we upgrade them into a Dual Card account, so just that dynamic of the upgrade from a PLCC to a Dual Card, will give you higher growth rate, faster growth rate in Dual Card than what we see in PLCC.", "I cannot tell you that the Dual Card growth rates have been relatively consistent more or less in line with our expectations. I think, right now we have Dual Card programs in 14 of our 20 relationships, so there are still an opportunity I think to launch some Dual Card programs in the rest of the portfolio.", "David Ho", "Okay. Given that the Sam's Club 531 card has very attractive, kind of similar value prop versus the Costco card. Do you expect any benefits from any kind of ongoing Costco card uncertainty as that potentially plays out and make it delayed? Are you baking in any kind of attrition into your core card op [ph] there?", "Brian Doubles", "We are not baking anything in for that. I think, The Sam's Club value props stands on its own, it is a very attractive value prop, 531 and we have been very pleased with the results so far since we launched it.", "David Ho", "Okay. Then separately on the deposit beta is obviously a lot of discussion this quarter across from your banking peers. It seems like you guys should be running closer to one versus some of your peers. Do you still think you could run near 75 or what kind of gets you confident that you could see and deposit betas will maybe a little lower than kind of what you are running at now?", "Brian Doubles", "Well, I think there are a couple things. There is not a lot of history here, so I do not think anybody knows as rates start to rise what deposit betas are going to look like. The landscapes are a lot different than the last. The only time period you can really look at is 2004 to 2007 and deposit betas for online platforms were between 60 and 70.", "Are they going to be higher this time around? They could be. I think as we look at it, first, we do not have any significant investment, no investment tied up in brick-and-mortar branches. I think that helps us offset the impact if deposit betas come in higher.", "We have obviously got pretty healthy margins, so I think if deposit betas come in on a high-end or a little bit higher, that is still fairly manageable for us, so time will tell where this thing plays out.", "The other thing that we are doing, we have talked about this I think in prior calls. Right now, we are competing to some extent on rate and I think customer service. To the extent that we can rollout some of these new capabilities, Margaret mentioned, demand checking accounts, online bill pay, that will help us lower the deposit beta over time and that is absolutely in the plans and we are looking at rolling those out next year.", "David Ho", "Okay. None of that is baked into you are kind of published asset sensitivity scenarios?", "Brian Doubles", "No. It is not.", "David Ho", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. Thanks. Most of my question actually have been asked and answered, but I actually was kind of intrigued that you had both, loan growth that was better than your spending volume growth and I guess a little bit of that was the acquisition of the portfolio, but still better and stable yield year-on-year.", "Could you talk a little bit about that? I would have thought that it is just a natural decay because of the stuff you talked about with respect to the way that portfolio has evolved?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Again, I would attribute a big chunk of that to BP, in fact that we only had a month worth of purchase volume, but we had obviously brought on all the receivables at the end of the quarter. I think that is part of the biggest driver to think about. Other than that, I do not know that there are any other underlying trends to highlight.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "With respect to just the yield on the portfolio, I mean, I would assume that like Dual Cards and other things like that probably have lower yields than some of your pure retail programs or some of the CareCredit things, right?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Typically in a Dual Card product, you get back to the net return, but you get there differently. If I just compare a private-label return to a Dual Card return, Dual Card tends to be higher FICO customer, so you will see less revolve on your accounts, you see lower financed charges, but that is largely offset by lower losses. When you kind of net those to how you get back to a similar return that we earn on PLCC. Again, on Dual Card, obviously, you are earning on a higher balance, so you are getting incremental earnings.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Sure. Then just separately, you had addressed this partway to Ryan's question before about portfolio acquisitions. Maybe just talk a little bit about what you see out there. You said almost 90% of your business is contracted for the next four years, but what is out there in terms of portfolios that could be available over the next year or two?", "Margaret Keane", "There is a plenty of portfolios. First of all the way we look at this is, just things coming up for us is always a natural set of portfolio that come up. I would not say Moshe, there is anything big out there.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Right.", "Margaret Keane", "I think the big portfolios, there is not a lot of over $1 billion portfolios out there, but there is plenty in the $250 million up to $1 billion that I think we are looking at and going after. I think the other is just looking at the start-ups.", "I mean, it is interesting to note that a number of retails still do not have a program and believe it or not we are seeing more activity of people actually reaching out to us enquiring about doing a portfolio, so there has been a little more activity there. I think some of that is driven by the fact that as retail sales struggle a bit, having a program certainly helps and we have proven that by the programs that we do have.", "Then there is the whole online space and things that are happening there. From an activity perspective, we are actually going after all of those things and I would say that we are fine with, and you know that is going for smaller deal to a bigger deal, so I think it gives us an opportunity to look more broadly.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.", "Rick Shane", "Thanks, guys, for taking my question. When we look back, I think it is easy to explain the post-crisis growth as a function of Synchrony was in the market providing capital when in general the supply was decreasing and we are now in an environment that is intensely competitive, supply has increased, we are seeing peers and one of the things we have noted is line limit increases, so a lot of the consumers with general purpose cards had sort of been unshackled, but you guys are still really generating strong organic growth.", "Brian, you talked about this a little bit, but what do you guys really think is driving this. Are we seeing a behavioral shift between general purpose and private label?", "Margaret Keane", "Well, I think, I would attribute it to really two things. One, I think, we are seeing this in terms of consumer behavior. The consumers are still being conservative about how they expand.", "I think the value propositions on our cards, in fact that we have I think got a good machine running around how we are putting out the next software, how we are using data and analytics, when you talk about or what Brian mentioned earlier about the re use of our cards and Payments Solution and CareCredit, those are things that we have really put in place over the last couple of years.", "I would say the other big win for us is really our whole digital strategy. If Brian mentioned this or I mentioned this in my opening, our online sales were up 20% year-over-year. If you look at the overall industry, U.S. sales are growing at 14%, so we are getting a big greater share of those online sales.", "Our mobile applications are really growing. About a third of our applications now come through mobile. Then 42% of our active customers are actually interacting with us some way using our digital channels, so I think as the consumer behavior shifts to mobile. I think one big advantage that we have versus many other general purpose credit cards is you can apply and buy immediately and you could do it on your mobile phone.", "I think our ability to capture that customer at the sites of purchase I think is really a big, big opportunity for us, and one that as we continue to build out our data and analytics team to really drive that and I think I mentioned in the past, we have partnered with GPShopper, who actually has some great mobile asset that we are integrating our cards programs with, particularly true for the smaller retailers maybe do not have a team sitting there to help them build out a mobile application. We are working with them to have that happen, so I think the whole digital pieces is going to become a bigger part of who we are and important part of how we go to market.", "Rick Shane", "Got it. Just to follow-up on that, I mean, as we enter into reporting season for peers as well, there are going to be a lot of questions over the next week about rewards and reward expenses. That's really where the competition seems to be playing out. We do not see that particularly in your margin or is there anything there that you are concerned about in terms of competitor behavior?", "Brian Doubles", "You know, there is nothing we are concerned about. You do see our loyalty costs are up, driven by the new value props that we have launched, but I think we look at these costs fundamentally just different than I think you look at them for general purpose card player in that the partner shares a significant portion of these costs.", "What we like is that we can offer a very attractive value proposition like we launched at Sam's Club, and like we just recently launched with Amazon, and when it nets through with the RSA offset, we still earn a very attractive return on that program.", "These new value props that we have launched are good things. They are driving growth, they are driving incremental finance charge revenue for the business, the partner share and part of the cost, so if we have the opportunity to launch better value props in our other programs, we are going to continue to look to do that. So we do not feel it necessarily as competitive pressure so much as we do a real opportunity to drive growth going forward.", "Rick Shane", "Got it. Great. Thank you guys.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks.", "Greg Ketron", "Okay. Vanessa, we have time for one more question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you. I guess, I have one question on Payment Solutions. It seems like you guys are definitely ramping up there in terms of the new relationships. Is there something there in terms of the economy that we can infer from, just the acceleration in new relationships there and should we expect more of that to occur as things get better in a broader sense?", "Then I have another question just on the digital strategy. To the extent that you are able to enhance your capabilities, can that help you ask for more from your merchants in terms of revenues? Thanks.", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. Let me answer the first on Payment Solutions. I think interestingly enough, Sanjay, I think, one of the things that has worked to our benefit, believe it or not, is the separation from GE. In fact that many of these partners are seeing us as this is all we are going to be doing. We are 100% dedicated to the retail market so our activity overall and Payment Solution has really picked up and some of it is, obviously, I said we dedicated resources and they are going after that.", "Even more importantly, we are getting people calling us, so I think there is a focus now that they know this is the business where are in and this is the business we are going to go after.", "We are very strong in that business, we have a lot and that is really the heritage of our business, right? We have a strong team there and I think, we have invested in things that I think have really help us from a technology perspective, which many of those retailers, you have the bigger guys, they have a lot of smaller retailers there who really look to us to help them really bring capabilities and I think that is something that has really played well for us.", "In terms of looking for more economics out of payment and mobile wallet, our goal is really to work with our partners to grow sales and we really see the wallet as really the final step in the process, so for us it is really building out the whole spectrum of the credit cycle applying, buying, getting a reward, getting your messaging and text messaging from us and then making a payment.", "I would not anticipate us looking to get more from our partners. We really want to work with them together in the overall relationship to grow the business, so that is how we are thinking about it and that is our business model, right, bringing capabilities and making it a better experience for their customers to really help drive volume growth for them.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "All right. Thank you.", "Margaret Keane", "Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks.", "Greg Ketron", "Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to further answer any questions you may have. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "And I will now turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Greg, you may begin.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause the actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.", "Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As most of you probably know by now, we received approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a standalone savings and loan holding company, following the completion of GE's proposed exchange offer.", "This approval represents a major step forward in Synchrony Financial journey to become a fully independent company. We are very pleased that we have reached this point. I want to thank everyone for all the hard work that has gone into this process, including my team, our employees and the help GE provided to us. We also want to thank the Federal Reserve and our regulators for working with us through this process.", "The next step in the process is the exchange offer, where GE will exchange its shares of Synchrony Financial common stock for shares of GE common stock. At this point, we are very limited and what information we can provide around that approval and the exchange offer other than what has been made public. As a result we will not be able to discuss any details around these issues on the call today.", "I will begin our discussion today on slide three, third quarter net earnings totaled $574 or $0.69 per share. Overall, strong momentum continued across our business platforms driving significant receivables deposits and revenue growth this quarter. Growth remained robust with purchase volume up 12%, loan receivables growth of 12% and platform revenue growth of 9%.", "We continue to offer attractive programs that resonate with customers, such as our Amazon prime card where cardholders receive 5% back, our Sam's Club 531 cash back credit card program below 5% discount on purchases everyday and reward programs with BP and Chevron, in addition to our ongoing promotional event. Our partners work with us as we continually search for innovative ways to drive program growth.", "Asset quality improved with 3 basis points decline in our net charge-off rate and a 24 basis points improvement in 30-plus delinquencies. Expenses were in line with our expectations, impacted by investments we made just for growth, separation-related costs and the completion of the EMV card rollout for active Dual Card holders.", "Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace, with deposit increasing $8 billion or 24% over the third quarter of last year. Deposits now comprise 63% of our funding, moving further into our target range of 60% to 70%. Our ongoing efforts to provide increasing value to our deposit with new features and enhancements are yielding notable results.", "Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.5%, calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter end.", "Key business highlights during the quarter included the extension of key existing contracts, including PayPal, one of our top 10 partners, the signing of two new partners, extension of our CareCredit network and further advancement of our technology platform to enhance the engagement experience with our customers.", "We are pleased to announce a long-term expansion with PayPal to provide Dual Cards to consumer. Our program with PayPal dates back to 2004 and these programs enable digital and mobile payments to online and offline merchants for qualifying cardholders. We're excited to expand our decade-long relationship with PayPal who is at the forefront of digital payment.", "We are also pleased to have renewed our partnership with Sleepy\u2019s, the third largest mattress retailer in United States, further enhancing the number of top retailers where we provide financing in the bedding space.", "Regarding new partners we have signed a multiyear agreement with Citgo, a leading U.S. refiner and marketer to provide a private label credit card program for new and existing customers.", "We expect to launch the program in the first quarter of 2016 and Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the nearly 5,500 locally-owned and operated Citgo locations in U.S.", "In addition, we are pleased to announce a new partnership with The Container Store, the nation's leading retailer of storage and organization products. This is a multiyear agreement to offer private label credit card program and the card will be available fees in the retailer's stores and online. The program is scheduled to launch in the spring of 2016.", "Additionally, we expanded our CareCredit network through a new agreement with Rite Aid, one of the nation's leading drugstore chain. Rite Aid will accept our CareCredit card for in-store purchases and health services in their nearly 4,600 stores nationwide. We also added a new multiyear agreement with Premier Dental Holding, one of the nation's largest dental provider.", "We're very excited about this new and extended partnership and our ability to add significant value to these relationships. Driving organic growth continues to be a key source of future opportunity and we continue to pursue initiatives to help card usage and deepen penetration across all of our partnerships.", "As we have noted in the past, the online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business. As reflected in our 2015 digital study, a comprehensive mobile strategy essential to the ability of retailers to effectively engage with our customers. In our national survey, we found that 45% of shoppers are now shopping with the mobile device and this is up 4 percentage points from last year.", "Additionally, one-third are purchasing products after viewing them on social media and one-third indicate that tax offers will drive an incremental shopping visit. Given these trends, we have been active in capitalizing on this evolving environment. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume, which is up 21% from last year and nearly a third of our credit applications are now done through digital channels. The adoption of our digital card also continues at a healthy pace.", "We continue to progress in our leading mobile wallet strategy and we are very pleased to be among the first issuers to offer private label cardholders the ability to add their cards to Samsung Pay, which launched in late September. We have currently enabled the use of over 12 million active accounts across our CareCredit and payment solutions platform and we intend to build on this.", "As many of you know, we have Dual Cards enabled and will be one of the first issuers with the capacity to offer private label credit cards through Apple Pay. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships, we are helping to shape the future of how private label card function in mobile world and provide value to our merchants and their customers. We have developed a mobile platform that can be rapidly integrated across retails and wallets.", "The speed at which we've been able to develop the capability for our cards to be in mobile wallet while maintaining the benefits for both our cardholders and partners speaks to our commitment to being at the forefront of this evolving payment landscape and our ability to capitalize on our leadership position.", "Moving to slide four which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 12% and average active account growth of 4%. The addition of the BP program last quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue was up 9% over the third quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing offers.", "On the next slide, I'll discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continue to drive strong performance across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter. Retail card had very strong performance this quarter generating purchase volume of 12% and receivables growth of 13%. The addition of BP last quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 10%.", "In addition to our new agreement with Citgo, we continue to expand our brand distribution with the launch of the Athleta credit program, one of the brand names on the gap. In addition to adding new partners that are a good strategic fit, renewing and extending our programs is a key priority in this business. Within the long-term extension of our program with PayPal, we now have nearly 92% of our retail card receivables that are under contract through 2019 and beyond.", "The strong position we maintain in this state and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. Payment solution delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 13% and loan receivables growth totaled 12% driving platform revenue growth of 8%. Average active accounts increased 8% over the last year.", "The majority of our industries have positive growth in both purchase volumes and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We exhibited significant success in finding multiple new partners this quarter, including the container store and our pipeline remains strong.", "We also launched new program this quarter, most notably Guitar Center, which included a portfolio conversion from another issuer and now gives us a preeminent position as a key financing partner in the music retail market. As noted, we extended our long-term relationship with BP. As a result of this, coupled with the announcement of MattressFirm in this summer, we now have programs with each of the top four bidding retailers in the U.S.", "CareCredit had a solid quarter and entered into important new agreement. Purchase volume was up 13% and average active accounts increased 5%, helping to drive receivables growth of 5% and platform revenue growth of 3% over the same quarter of last year. Receivable growth this quarter was led by dental and veterinary specialties.", "Regarding the new agreement, the agreement with Rite Aid will extend the facility of our CareCredit card to nearly 4600 Rite Aid stores nationwide and the agreement with Premier Dental Holdings which has nearly 200 clinics with nearly 1 million consumers in the western part of the U.S. will result in the origination and the acceptance of CareCredit card in their offices. Plans are in place to launch CareCredit, native application in the fourth quarter, which will feature the CareCredit digital card and be available to cardholders via the Apple and Google Play app stores.", "In summary, each platform delivered solid growth and continue to make progress in the signing of new partnership and the extension of existing programs while continuing to drive organic growth.", "I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks Margaret. I\u2019ll start on slide six of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $574 million net income which translates to $0.69 per diluted share in quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 12%, receivables up 12% and platform revenue up 9%.", "Overall, we're pleased with the growth we have generated across the business. We continue to see evidence of the value proposition on our cards are resonating with consumers. Purchase volume per active account was up 8% compared to last year and the average balance per account increased as well. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition last quarter. So that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year.", "Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year. Interest income was up 9%, which is in line with our average receivables growth.", "RSAs were up $30 million or 4% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.6% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than 4.8% we reported in the third quarter last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA a percentage of average receivable as well as higher loyalty costs that are directly shared through the RSA with our retailers.", "For the year, we would expect RSAs as a percentage of receivables to be in the 4.5% range consistent with the prior two years. The provision increased $27 million or 4% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth, partly offset by the improvement in asset quality. Improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30 plus delinquencies, which improved 24 basis points versus last year to 4.02% and in the net charge-off rate, which fell to 4.02%, 3 basis points below last year.", "Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 15 basis points compared to the third quarter last year to 5.31%. However, measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage remained at 1.27 times virtually the same coverage level as the prior three quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.", "Other income decreased $12 million versus last year, primarily driven by higher loyalty and rewards costs, partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $34 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our dual card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $38 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense run back to our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.", "Debt cancellation fees of $61 million were down $7 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $115 million versus the third quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build, the majority of the increase was driven by three items.", "First, we continued to make investments to support ongoing growth across all of our platforms. Second, we had expenses associated with the rollout of EMV cards for active Dual Card holders. The rollout was completed this quarter ahead of the October liability shift dates.", "Lastly, we continued to make strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34.2% and 33.3% year to date, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, we had strong topline growth that drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.9%.", "I will move to slide seven and go through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income growth was strong at 8%. Interest and fees on loan receivables was up 8%, partially offset by higher interest expense, driven by growth and the additional liquidity we're carrying on the balance sheet compared to last year.", "The net interest margin declined to 15.97%, which was fairly consistent with prior quarters and better than the outlook we provided back in January. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, 77 basis points was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio.", "We increased liquid assets on the balance sheet to $15.3 billion, which is up $1.2 billion versus last year. We have the cash invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the fed, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets. The yield on our receivables is down 33 basis points compared to last year. This was a result of slightly higher payment rates and the impact of portfolio mix, given the strong growth in promotional balances on our payment solutions platform.", "Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%, up 9 basis points compared to last year. This was in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I will walk you through a breakdown by funding source.", "First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable at 1.6%, the same level as the third quarter last year. Our deposit base increased nearly $8 billion, or 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 63% of our funding, which is in line with the target we set between 60% and 70%.", "Securitization funding costs were relatively flat at 1.6%. Our other debt costs increased 53 basis points to 2.9%, due to the higher mix of bank term loans and unsecured bonds compared to last year. While the third quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans.", "As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margins and expect them to decline slightly due to the seasonal build up in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.", "Next, I will cover our key credit trends on slide eight. As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.02%, down 24 basis points versus last year. 90 plus delinquencies were 1.73%, down 12 basis points. We continued to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year.", "The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.02%, down 3 basis points versus last year. And lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.31%, which was down 15 basis points from the prior year. If you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months charge-offs, we're currently at 1.27 times coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve. And as I noted earlier, this is very consistent with prior quarters.", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and the decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables due to holiday spending in the seasonal build on receivables. So overall, we continued to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we are seeing.", "Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line and we're delivering on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we are at 33.3%. Expenses came at $843 million for the quarter and compared to last year, largely driven by separation-related costs and growth of the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we also had approximately $20 million in expenses related to the EMV card rollout this quarter.", "Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $29 million as we've added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of new business. Professional fees were up $13 million due to both, separation-related costs and growth.", "Marketing and business development costs were flat, as we had increases driven by investments in the growth of our retail programs, as well as marketing associated with our direct deposit products. These increases were offset by lower spend on brand advertising. Information processing was up $30 million, driven by higher IT investments and in the increase in transactions and purchase line compared to last year.", "Other increased $43 million versus prior year, primarily driven by growth in the infrastructure build. As we noted last quarter, the costs associated with the infrastructure build are now largely reflected in our run rate and total expenses remain in line with our expectations. We expect to finish the year within our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year.", "Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continued to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by nearly $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program.", "This puts deposits at 63% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. And while we now move further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products later next year such as checking and online bill pay.", "Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion to $15 billion range, which is approximately 21% of our funding. We did issue $600 million in securitization bonds in September with three and five-year maturities. This is consistent with our approach to maintain this source of funding at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. We also issued $1 billion in tenure fixed rate senior unsecured notes in July.", "As we\u2019ve said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility, as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower cost funding sources. We have continued to pay this down during the quarter, making a $500 million prepayment in August.", "Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $4.7 billion today and expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.", "Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 17.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 16.6% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. Total liquidity increased to $21.9 billion and includes $15.3 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.6 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 28% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.", "Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.", "And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Brian. I will close the summary of the quarter on slide 11 and then move again with the Q&A portion of the call.", "During the quarter we exhibited broad-based growth across several key areas making progress on several fronts and continuing the momentum that we have generated over the last several quarters. We continue to win and renew important partnerships as well as opportunities to expand our network and the utility of our cards, and our pipeline of additional opportunities remains strong. Our digital wallet strategy continues to deliver meaningful partnerships with attractive opportunities. Our innovation and adaptability enabled us to be among the first private label issuers to make our cards and their functionality available through Samsung Pay. We are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast growing deposit platform.", "And finally with the fed approval to become a standalone savings and loan holding company, we look ahead to the next step in this process, the proposed exchange offer. Again, I want to acknowledge all of the hard work that has gone into this process. We are proud of having achieved the important step in our progress towards separation. As I noted earlier, we are restricted in what we can say today, but please stay tuned on this front as additional details on the exchange offer become available.", "I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you. Good morning. Congrats on getting the approval from the fed. Just reading through that 17-page order, I didn\u2019t notice any language around CCAR and I understand you\u2019re approved as a savings and loan holding company. Does that mean that CCAR doesn\u2019t apply to you guys? And if yes, what exactly is the process of getting to return capital to shareholders? And also maybe taking liquidity down from the levels that you have it? Thanks.", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. Good morning, Sanjay. It\u2019s Margaret. So I will hand it over to Brian, but I just wanted to just reiterate how important this milestone was for us and getting the separation from GE really is the biggest part of the milestone. Brian is really going to take you through a little bit of learning around CCAR and where we\u2019re going to go forward on that.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. So Sanjay, you\u2019re absolutely right, there is nothing in the order that specifically subjects us to the CCAR process. And we\u2019ve discussed in the past because we\u2019re savings and loan holding company and not a bank holding company, we\u2019re not technically subject to the CCAR process. So, that\u2019s where we stand as of today.", "With all that said, it\u2019s still our expectation that we\u2019re going to file a capital plan with the fed. And it\u2019s going to be based on the fed\u2019s CCAR assumptions. So it\u2019s very likely that even though we\u2019re not part of the public process, we are going to follow a very similar process to the upper banks in terms of using the same assumptions, following the same timeline and we think that gives us probably the best chance of success in 2016. So that it\u2019s going to look similar, but you\u2019re not going to see it as part of the formal public process.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Okay. And this is part, the liquidity is concerned. And just one follow-up. So does that mean that you would just put through your own assumption -- you would follow the assumptions of CCAR through your own model?", "Brian Doubles", "That\u2019s our indication\u2026", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Right.", "Brian Doubles", "\u2026 exactly, so we would\u2026", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Yeah.", "Brian Doubles", "We would grab those assumptions when they\u2019re published in February. We will run those through our models. We\u2019d formulate a capital plan. We\u2019d submit that to the fed. It\u2019s just one the part of the public process, that\u2019s our expectation as we say here today.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Okay. Great.", "Brian Doubles", "So that\u2019s capital. You asked about liquidity as well. I think the liquidity is going to be consistent with what we said in the past. I think we feel like we\u2019ve got more than adequate liquidity today. I think we\u2019ve got a couple opportunities to optimize the amount of liquidity that we\u2019re holding. We\u2019ve also got an opportunity I think to look at different ways to invest that excess cash.", "You\u2019ve seen us do that a little bit all year where we run our internal models, we look at rating agency considerations, regulatory considerations. We look at our maturities coverage. And to the extent that we have, we feel we have some excess liquidity. You\u2019ve seen us use that to prepay the bank term loan. You\u2019re going to continue to see us do that. That\u2019s part of the reason obviously why our net interest margin has trended better than the guidance we provided back in January. But I wouldn\u2019t expect going forward to see a step change in how we manage liquidity.", "The regulatory considerations are just one piece of the puzzle. We add up all the other considerations, our internal models and that\u2019s where we used to size the amount of liquidity we have. So I think there is some opportunity there, but it\u2019s going to be more around the margin, it\u2019s not going to be a step change from what we\u2019re doing today.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey, good morning, everyone. And congrats on getting approval.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "I guess for starters, your loan growth is coming well above the 6% to 8% that your outlook had called for. I was wondering maybe can you give us a breakdown, and how much of the growth is coming from actually improved penetration rates versus portfolio wins? And as you look forward clearly the PayPal renews big way from you, but how should we think about your ability to sustain loan growth at or near the current rates?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, Ryan, most of the loan growth year-to-date has been organic, core organic growth and that\u2019s really tendership, that\u2019s the value props that we\u2019ve launched at Sam's Club and Amazon. And the only portfolio acquisition we\u2019ve done which impacted the results of our year-to-date is BT, which we closed in the second quarter and obviously impact -- continues to impact our results in the third quarter when you look year-over-year.", "So I think the fundamentals are very strong. As you pointed out, we are ahead of where we thought we would be back in January. We still got the holiday season that\u2019s going to largely determine where we end up for the year, this is the forecast or somewhere between 3% and 4% similar to what we thought last year. So we\u2019re optimistic.", "And when you break down the components of the growth, the underlying trends are positive too. So we are saying purchase volume for active account was up 8%. When you look at the average balance per active account, that was up 5%. So when you break down the different components, the fundamentals are strong as well. I will turn it over to Margaret to talk about PayPal.", "Margaret Keane", "Yes. So we\u2019re really excited about the PayPal extension. As I have said in the past, we\u2019ve had a really good partnership, a long-term partnership with PayPal since 2004. And I think they were working through their strategy, we\u2019re working through our strategy. We continue to have a really good dialogue through that process. And as a result of some good thinking on both sides, we\u2019ve come together and we will be extending our partnership. So it\u2019s a win for them, a win for us, and we feel pretty excited about being able to keep them.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. And maybe if I could just ask one question on the margin. When I think about how it\u2019s trended over the past year or so, it\u2019s obviously come down, but clearly better than expectations had been. And when you think about it, you\u2019ve had call the 30 basis points direct from yields and 70 from the big liquidity belt. But when I think about the comments that you made Brian on the ability to optimize some by investing some of the cash, if we were to assume that yields do continue to come down in the loan book, is there enough deployment for you to do such that you can largely offset a lot of the core pressure on the margin and we can may be see a margin level that\u2019s similar to the performance that you\u2019ve had thus far in 2015 as we look forward?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. Ryan, here is the couple of things. Let me just start with one, one of your promises is that loan yield will continue to come down. I think one other things that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date when we look at the loan yields that have come down primarily driven by higher payment rates, which we\u2019re obviously getting a benefit when we look at 30 plus, 90 plus and charge-off performance year-to-date.", "So to the extent that loss performance kind of levels out from here then we would expect loan yield to level off as well and we might not see that deterioration. So I think that that just one kind of starting point.", "We\u2019ve also when you look at the loan yield, part of that is also driven by just a really strong growth in payment solutions and we\u2019re putting that volume on as largely promotional financing, so it\u2019s coming on at the lower yield initially. And then as those accounts start to revolve, we expect a little bit of lift there in the yield.", "On liquidity, I think, there is nothing that we see that is going to result in margins coming down significantly from where they are today. They have performed better year-to-date because we\u2019ve been able to use them, what we view is access to pay down the more expensive performance of financing.", "We\u2019re going to continue to do that. We still got a big chunk to go on the bank term loan. So I think we still have some opportunity there and then, I think, we\u2019ve got a little bit of opportunity on the -- how that cash is invested. So you\u2019re going to see us continue to optimize that in terms of more specific outlook. So we\u2019re going to give you some guidance on the January call for 2016 and we can be a little more specific then.", "Ryan Nash", "Great. Thanks for taking my question.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And thank you, our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.", "Mark DeVries", "Yeah. Thanks. Just a follow-up question on the CCAR process, since you will be opting into that kind of voluntarily not going to the public process, will that impact, asking all in terms of capital returns? Could we expect something potentially in excess of what peers might be asking for?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. Mark, I just will be careful that we\u2019re not opting into CCAR. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re filing a capital plan using the CCAR assumptions. And the reason we\u2019re doing that is pretty straightforward. The Fed has the process. They measure all the other banks on and similar banks of our size and we think that our best chance to success is to be measured kind of on the same basis and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it.", "But I wouldn't view it as opting and we just think that we\u2019re trying to take what we feel is the path here to gives us the best chance to success and I think following the Fed framework and the process that they have allows us to do that.", "We\u2019re not going to be specific around our capital ask the first time out. What I would tell you though is that, it's more important for us to get a dividend approved, a buyback program approved than it is to go on our first time and swing for the fences.", "So we\u2019re going to be fairly prudent and I also first time out. And again, we want to have a successful first outing here as opposed to trying to go for something that greater than our peers right out of the case.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. But is something comparable to your peers given -- particularly given your even stronger capital position, does that feel reasonable and conservative to you?", "Brian Doubles", "Mark, I am just -- I'm not going to give you more than that right now.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay.", "Brian Doubles", "We\u2019re going to get the assumptions in February. We\u2019re going to run them. We\u2019ve got obviously review it with our Board. We got to go through all of our own internal governance processes and then we\u2019re going to submitted to the Fed. So there is a lot -- there is work to do between now and when we actually submit. That just it be premature to give you any kind of indication at this point.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay.", "Brian Doubles", "I will say, obviously, we have a lot of capital when you compares to our peers. The return profiles on our business compares very well to our peers. Those are all real positives for us and we think the long-term capital return presented for this business is significant.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more follow-up on PayPal, I think, our sense was that you kind of expecting -- who you expecting that to go away, so the fact you\u2019re able to renew it is when? Am I right that you were expecting kind of a 2% to 3% headwind to loan growth and that going away, and therefore, that not going away could be a big help for your loan growth in 2016?", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah. That\u2019s right.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. PayPal was disclosed as $1.5 billion receivable that was expected to go away towards the end of 2016.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Now we\u2019ll be retaining it.", "Mark DeVries", "Got it. Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And thank you, our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. Thanks. You guys talked about two essential wins. I guess that you probably took away from other issuers both Citgo and Guitar Center. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment and kind of what's out there? And how you were able to get those? And what else -- what other areas are you looking at?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. So I would say that we feel really good about our pipeline and activity in our pipeline. I think we said in the past, we have seen truly dedicated against all three platforms. There is a competitive environment out there. I don't -- we don\u2019t see it being any worse in the private label space than it\u2019s -- or as competitive maybe as the bigger co-brand deal.", "So, we think that the competition is playing in the right areas. I think for us, we\u2019re winning really on capabilities. I think it\u2019s around some of the investments we've made in terms of mobile and analytics and data that are really helping us to win this partnership. I think having a more focused process in the three platforms has also helped us. And frankly, I think the other thing that\u2019s really been interesting for us is since we separated out, I think we\u2019re actually getting cogged in, which is new to us.", "So we feel like we're in a really good spot. I think, we said before, we don\u2019t have to win every deal because we grow mostly by organic growth. And so I think it allows us to really be awful on the deals that we do want to get. At the end of the day, the most important thing for us is getting partnerships where we feel like we're bringing value to that partner and then the partners sees that value because that\u2019s really how you make these relationships long term and sticky going forward. So we feel pretty good about the pipeline going forward.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Just a follow-up, one of your large partners, Sam's did announce they were going to be taking another card brand and can you talk a little bit about how you can kind of defend against that\u2026?", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah. Sure. So it\u2019s really not that unusual for merchants to except another network. As matter of fact, Sam\u2019s had already been accepting Amex on their online portal already. I think for us it\u2019s somewhat of an opportunity because if folks start coming in using their Amex card, we have the opportunity to cross sell our card. And I think the uniqueness of the way the card works in Sam\u2019s, our credit card is the membership card, it becomes one.", "So it\u2019s really easy for consumers to use or customers to use when they\u2019re in club. And I think the other is we have a fantastic value prop on our Sam\u2019s MasterCard. So we feel --listen, no one likes anyone coming in, right. We look at these things. We have a good discussion. We have a great partnership with Sam\u2019s. We\u2019re very integrated with Sam\u2019s. And in someway this could be an opportunity for us to cross sell.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. Thanks, Margaret.", "Operator", "And thank you, our next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.", "David Ho", "Hi. Good morning. I have a question about the implications from the separation on potentially, expenses and kind of what you can do to drive efficiency gains now that you separate from GE and possibly not being part of CCAR process and having greater transparency and kind of what you need to do on the quality of aspects. Is there any opportunity there?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. David, I wouldn\u2019t think about a significant opportunity there just related to separation. As we\u2019ve said in the past, the infrastructure build costs are now in the run rate. So when you look at the expenses, when you look at just sequential bill from second quarter to third quarter, it was relatively modest, just driven by growth in EMV and we always see a seasonal increase in the third quarter. But the infrastructure build cost and everything that we\u2019ve built to prepare for separation is reflected in the run rate.", "And just based on the earlier comments I made, even though we are not technically subject to CCAR, the expectations are going to be similar. They are not going to be exactly the same, but they are going to be similar. And so I think it will be premature to talk about any kind of expense benefit that we expect from this, because we are holding ourselves to the same standards that the fed is holding others too. So we are going to go through a couple rounds here on filing a capital plan and doing liquidity access with the outgoes and maybe there is a longer-term opportunity, but nothing we see in the near-term.", "David Ho", "Okay. That's helpful. And separately, the renewal with PayPal is obviously a big positive. Can you talk about the implications on maybe the RSA and kind of on marketing expenses and have the upfront impact from that renewal as they are coming, similar economics or worse can you expected? And maybe renewals in general, what would you expect there going forward?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. All the renewals that we've done private with the exception of PayPal are reflected in our run rate, so that -- you can get some broad comment on renewals. On PayPal specifically, we can\u2019t get into the pricing and the economics. But I can tell you that as Margaret said, we are really excited about extending the relationship with PayPal. We are able to do that, return is very attractive for us.", "So, we\u2019re going to continue to look to extend these programs. And I think we\u2019re able to do that in a way that\u2019s attractive for us, attractive for PayPal and PayPal customers. And one other things that we are going to do is part of that new relationship is we\u2019re going to upgrade some of the accounts to Dual Cards, a big portion of accounts to Dual Cards, we think that will help us drive growth going forward.", "So there's a number of things that we changed in the program, but from our perspective all very much aligned with growing the program and we are going to do that at a return that\u2019s attractive for us.", "David Ho", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.", "Don Fandetti", "Yes. Sort of building on the same question, Brian on the Amazon Prime deal, can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s progressing? And then secondarily, clearly there have been some mixed economic data points from your numbers, it looks like things were pretty steady. Can you talk about if you\u2019ve seen any sort of ups and downs in credit or spend trends?", "Margaret Keane", "Maybe I\u2019ll start with where is the consumer spending and where we see the trends and then turn over to the Brian to some of the other points to asked. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the trend continued to indicate the consumer is getting stronger. Brain will talk a little bit about the credit. We see that getting a little bit better. I think gas prices and unemployment are certainly helping the consumer. I think the consumer is still cautious and they are definitely looking for deals and promotions.", "So I think our value props are really playing very favorably to the consumer. The one area that I\u2019ve mentioned before that continues to be performing well are things related to the home. So things like furniture trends are pretty strong. So we feel pretty good about where the consumer is right now. And I think a combination of our marketing, the data analytics, the building out of our mobile capability is really helping us drive some of those volumes.", "Don Fandetti", "Got it.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. So the other question you have was around the Amazon. And I think similar to what we\u2019ve said earlier we\u2019re really excited about the 5% value prop for Prime customers. We\u2019re measuring that every day, we\u2019re looking at the new account flow, we\u2019re looking at the purchase volume. Any time you can make a significant change to a value proposition like we did in Amazon, you want to do that in a way we\u2019re kind of soft launching it.", "You are doing a lot of testing control. So you make sure that it\u2019s delivering the economic performance that we expect and it\u2019s a good customer experience for the Amazon cardholders. And so far it\u2019s performing very much in line with our expectations and we are optimistic that we can do some more marketing around that offer here in the near term.", "Don Fandetti", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.", "Rick Shane", "Thanks guys. And somebody down really asked my question but I\u2019ll pursue it little bit more deeply. Obviously, the Amazon value preposition is very compelling. It\u2019s a new program that strikes me as a program that could have a high degree of seasonality given the nature of your partner. Can you just talk about what should we be thinking about in Q4 in terms of potential impact on volume, but more importantly in terms of RSA and provision expense?", "Margaret Keane", "Why don\u2019t I start off? First of all, I think one of the positives of Amazon 5% for Prime customers it's really encouraging everyday spend. So, I think that\u2019s really what the customer, Amazon is really trying to do. They are trying to get that Prime customer to not only buy big ticket items and things like that but growth seasonal and other things. So the 5% really encourages you to go there to that site versus somewhere else. So, we think that\u2019s really great.", "Our business is a seasonal business, so obviously holiday is a big opportunity for us. We\u2019re heading into that. We think that Amazon 5% is going to be just a fantastic offering and we hope to see some broader offering of that as we go into the holiday season. So, I think overall this is a great offering and one that as Brian said, we are really watching because I think as we get into the holiday season, the key for us is really making sure that consumer is getting everything they need and things are working in a right way and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really been soft for both on our site and the Amazon folks on their site to ensure the experience for the customer is very, very good. I don\u2019t know Brain if you\u2026", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. I mean in terms of more specific fourth quarter impact, it's really hard to estimate at this point because obviously, we've got to determine and work out with Amazon to what extent and how broad we are going to go with the marketing in the fourth quarter, what the adoption rate is going to look like, what the spends going to look like and this is very fluid.", "As I mentioned earlier, we are monitoring this thing almost hourly with Amazon. Our teams sit with them and they look at the spending patterns, the types of purchases, the repeat purchases. And then from our perspective, from a credit perspective, we are also looking at the population of transactor versus revolvers and the credit mix and through the door population. So there is just a number of factors that we are looking at and I can tell you so far, it's performing in line with our expectations, but it's a little too early to give any kind of specific forecast.", "Rick Shane", "Okay. Fair enough. Second question, you mentioned in third quarter, $20 million of EMV reissue expense. Can you just help us understand where we are in that process? I\u2019m assuming, you are most of the way through that, but could you just let us know what fourth quarter will look like?", "Margaret Keane", "We are 100% complete with our active Dual Cards being rolled out for EMV.", "Rick Shane", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Margaret Keane", "Obviously, we will have an ongoing expense as new cards come due but the bulk is just behind us.", "Rick Shane", "Great. Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.", "Jamie Friedman", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Margaret, I think in your opening comments you had discussed that a third of the applications are now coming mobile and online. I guess it's Apple Pay. I was wondering how that helps your business processes. Does it improve the credit quality? Does it improve the data or the speed, if you could talk in that direction that will be helpful?", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah. I think it is two things. Obviously, the speed part is really good. But I think the other is, we are continually looking at ways to ensure that it\u2019s almost like a seamless process. So for instance, if you were to apply through the Amazon card and you are doing that online, it becomes your preferred card in the wallet. So we are continually looking at ways that how do we get to the speed of the answer, get your card and then make it that card of choice if you will. So that helps us in our positioning.", "The other is as customers and our research shows it, as customers in particular are looking to make bigger purchases by being able to put an online offers out there in terms of discount depending on the promotion or type of thing they are purchasing, the ability for you to apply and buy right online, while you are looking at those items is really a big opportunity for us. So I think that\u2019s another big area of focus for us.", "And then lastly, I think, as we continue to look at how people are shopping, the mobile channel and online it just become a much bigger part of how people are really looking to purchase.", "So being -- it\u2019s a combination of thing. It\u2019s really having that application processes really seamless, but then connecting your marketing offers to make that customer really realize, oh, I can get a bigger item or I can get a bigger basket, if I get X card from any of our retailers, because I have credit available to me and that\u2019s really a combination of all the things we are really trying to play out.", "Jamie Friedman", "And I also want to ask about currency or MCX, they\u2019ve seem to be finally make some progress? There has been a couple of trades that have tracked their introductions in the market just this month? I was wondering if you could give us an update as to where you stand with them, I know that you have partnerships in place, but some sort of visibility would be helpful?", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah. We, obviously, we have Samsung and Wal-Mart, who are a big part of our currency. We continue to build out the currency capability and we will launch as soon as they are ready to launch in the Wal-Mart and Samsung organization and some of our other partners as soon as they are ready.", "So, I think, they are working through some of the functionality and doing some more testing. So, I think, in the near-term you will hear something of that being out in marketplace.", "Jamie Friedman", "Great. Appreciate the update.", "Operator", "And thank you, our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi. Good morning.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning.", "Betsy Graseck", "Question on the CareCredit platform, some competitors, some marketplace lenders have been suggesting that they're interested in competing in that space and I just want to get take the opportunity to understand how you feel your penetration has been going, how your progress has been against goals you set out and whether or not you\u2019ve seen any incremental competition coming from these new lenders or not?", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah. I will start-off with, we have an incredible platform with CareCredit and we have enormous penetration in the industry that we are in. So, I think, when you start with that, one of the things that I think is unique in CareCredit, unless you see the dental space as an example. It\u2019s not like you can go on sign-up the Wal-Mart and get a whole bunch of volume, you literally have to go dental office to dental office to dental office across the United States.", "So to gain traction and build-out that platform from a start-up is extraordinary hard. So we are not really seeing that competition really have any impact on us at this point. Many of the competitors also are doing more of an installment type lending versus revolving lending, and I think one of the unique things that we\u2019ve really been able to build out. First of all, we have incredible brand-name.", "Our brand, we do market testing is, we see extraordinary rollout of customers who use that products. We are getting 50% of our transactions now repeat purchases. So I went into like that and I use it in the dental office or things like that.", "I think our example today of partnering with Rite Aid, where we are really looking at how do we increase the utility of the card, because the customers who have that card have a great affinity to it.", "So we are not really seeing these guys. I know they are out there. We obviously we keep an eye on all our competition, but I think given our experience in the space, we have this business for 25 years, we are now there for 25 years. So I think, we are well ahead of those guys and I think it will take a little time for them even really have any type of kind of impact on us if they even do.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay.", "Brian Doubles", "And I think, Betsy, you can look at is the purchase volume trends have also been pretty strong year-to-date. In the first quarter purchase volume was 5.6%, second quarter was 8.5%, this quarter was 12.5%, so we are very encouraged by the trend we are seeing around purchase volume as well.", "Betsy Graseck", "Right. I mean, it\u2019s a little bit more expensive channel to run than the other two platforms, is that accurate statement?", "Margaret Keane", "Well, I think, you need infrastructure behind both these platform and payment solution\u2026", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Margaret Keane", "\u2026 because you are dealing with thousands of merchants and you need a merchant process behind same in sourcing to work in the right way. So it\u2019s a bigger build-out I would say, and we have been out this for really long-time.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Margaret Keane", "So, I think, we have certainly have scale in that.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And then just second thing, one of your major retail partners Wal-Mart obviously this week had an Analyst Day with highlight a little bit of lower expectation for spend trajectory, and I wonder if you could comment about that and impact on your business?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. So, obviously, we saw the same thing. What I would say to you is that, traditionally and we\u2019ve shown trust and earnest. We outperformed the retailer two to three times from an organic growth perspective on our card programs we are always doing better than the retailer. And I would say that our program both with Samsung, Wal-Mart are very strong. We are doing really well.", "I\u2019d also say to you that this is an always -- when retailers go through challenging times and we\u2019ve been in this business eight years. For sure, we\u2019ve seen people win and lose at different points. This is where our partnership becomes even that more value and this is where I think our unique business model makes a difference. So this is where you have to stick by a partner and our goal is to figure out ways that we can help Wal-Mart even further.", "So they usually becomes more of an engagement on how cards or how card could help them grow their sales. So, we are watching it, we are not worried. Our performance is very strong. They are great partners. We have great relation. We have 80 people sitting out in that though who all they think about every single day is Wal-Mart and Samsung and that\u2019s their job. Their job is to figure out how to grow sales for our partner and that\u2019s the model that\u2019s tries who we are. So, we feel okay. I think they got a bump road but we will be with them all the way and I think we will help them as they go through that process.", "Betsy Graseck", "Thanks.", "Greg Ketron", "All right, Vanessa. We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And thank you, our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been asked. I thought I would just ask one about the penetration rates. You highlight ongoing organic growth is the primary source of growth. It appears that that\u2019s really the result of improving penetration of your partners. Are you seeing any changes in the case of penetration, or should we just assume some consistency there?", "Margaret Keane", "Well, it varies by partners. So, we have partners where we have very high penetration and then partners we have single-digit penetration. I think the way to think about it is, there are couple of different areas where I think our marketing and the way we are approaching the market is really just helping ourselves. We talked about this repeat purchase concept and CareCredit and Payment Solutions. So, we are doing a lot more marketing in those two platforms around getting customers to use the card again.", "And that\u2019s a good example because if you went into this business four years ago, five years ago, with a bigger ticket purchase we thought of it as a one-end done. You bought whatever you bought and that was it. And our ability to really get customers to reuse the card, I think is a really big factor and those two platforms. I think on the Retail Card platform, I think probably one of the things that\u2019s really helping us besides the great value prospect we\u2019ve put out there, the [Sam's envelopes] [ph] and Amazon, the once we talked about. Mobiles and online is definitely helping us. We are outpacing the industry.", "So the industry for online sales year-over-year is about 14%. We\u2019re growing at 21% year-over-year and I think that\u2019s having an impact. And we know for fact through our research is the customer shops both brick-and-mortar and online and mobile that we have a tighter relationship with that customer and they will make more shopping trip and they will have bigger baskets.", "So I think the more we can connect those dots in making that brick-and-mortar and online digital experience seamless to the consumer, I think we have an opportunity to continue to grow penetration.", "John Hecht", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And second question is just thinking of your new program ramps, I mean, what\u2019s that -- your BP, Guitar Center, I guess, Citgo, are those fully -- are those in the ramp stage or they kind of fully -- or they have normal run rates at this point in time to help us think about how those might improve in near term?", "Brian Doubles", "BP is obviously in the run rate as of the second quarter and that\u2019s lifting our growth rate. We saw that in the second quarter and the third quarter. The other two are in -- sorry, Guitar Center is in thick of knot end. So you will see a little bit of a ramp there but just I can\u2019t give you the actual size of either one of them but they are smaller in relation to BP. So you just kind of take that into account.", "John Hecht", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Greg Ketron", "Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day.", "Operator", "And thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

And I will now turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining our call.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.", "Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter and then Brian will give details on our financial results. I will begin on Slide 3.", "First quarter net earnings totaled $582 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Overall, solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms driving strong double-digit growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and platform revenue this quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 17% and platform revenue and loan receivables grew 13%. We continue to see strong growth in our online and mobile purchase volume. Our online and mobile sales growth has been steadily accelerating and first quarter sales grew 29% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range.", "Asset quality metrics were relatively stable this quarter in line with our expectations. 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.85% and our net charge-off rate was 4.7% in the range of losses we have experienced in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Expenses were in line with our expectations increasing 7% over last year. This was largely driven by investments we made in support of our growth initiatives. However, our overall efficiency ratio improved 1.8 percentage points to 30.4%, reflecting our strong revenue growth this quarter. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which grew $10 billion or 29% to $45 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprised 69% of our funding sources at the high end of our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. And at this point, you can expect for us to grow a little beyond that original target range.", "One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. We plan to launch new product offerings later this year, which will augment growth and enhance the retention of our deposit base. Given the significant growth in deposits, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5. We are pleased that we were able to pay off this loan well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019.", "Our balance sheet remained strong, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.1% calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end. We renewed several key relationships during the quarter, including Stein Mart and La-Z-Boy. We also signed a new partnership with Marvel and recently launched the Marvel MasterCard with an attractive cash-back value proposition. We are further leveraging this relationship by developing creative ways to market our deposit products to the Marvel fan base. The new value proposition delivers the greatest benefit on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. Cardholders receive 3% cash-back on spending in these types of categories and 1% cash-back on other purchases.", "We are excited about this partnership and the value this new card will bring to loyal Marvel fans and others who enjoy the benefit of a cash-back program. The partnership will also offer a unique opportunity to co-promote our deposit products in conjunction with the Marvel feature film. We launched a new campaign called Save Like a Hero which will feature Synchrony Bank saving products and be tied to the release of Marvel\u2019s new Captain America movie. This is the second starter program we have rolled out in the travel and entertainment space. You will recall that last quarter we also launched our Stash Hotel Rewards program. We think this is an area that provides attractive opportunities.", "During the quarter, we also launched our new Citgo card program. Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the 5,000 plus locally owned and operated Citgo locations in the United States. We continue to work with our partners, new and existing, to develop compelling value propositions for their cardholders. This quarter, we launched a new value prop with Walmart. The program brings even more value to the everyday purchases customers make using their Walmart cards. The 3-2-1 Save cash-back program provides qualifying cardholders the opportunity to earn rewards for purchases they make everyday, including 3% back on purchases made on walmart.com, 2% back on fuel purchases at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations and 1% back on purchases made at Walmart stores and everywhere that Walmart cards are accepted. The 3-2-1 Save program simplifies and strengthens the card proposition for Walmart cardholders. We work closely with Walmart to meet the evolving needs of their customers and we are excited about this program as it also recognizes the increasing move to online and mobile shopping. It is the first credit card program designed to offer Walmart cardholders even greater savings on their online purchases. We are highly focused on innovating ways to drive organic growth as it remains a key priority and opportunity. We continue to work closely with our partners to deliver growth across all sales channels.", "Moving to Slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 13% primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 17% and average active account growth of 7%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 13% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers that deliver value to our partners and customers.", "On the next slide, I will discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. Retail Card generated especially strong results this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 17% and receivables grew 14%. The addition of BP in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 15%. The strong growth in Retail Card was broad-based as we saw growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter in Retail Card. We renewed and extended the Stein Mart program. We signed a new partnership with Marvel and launched the new Marvel MasterCard this month and we launched the new value proposition with Walmart, the 3-2-1 Save cash-back program. The position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth.", "Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 15% and receivables grew 13% driving platform revenue growth of 14%. Average active accounts increased 12% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We renewed a key home furnishing relationship with the extension of our La-Z-Boy partnership.", "We continue to expand card reuse and payment solutions, with repeat purchase volume growing 18% year-over-year. Reuse represented 27% of purchase volume in the first quarter. CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Purchase volume was up 14% and receivables grew 9%, driving platform revenue growth of 6%. Average active accounts increased 7% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Card reuse continues to be an area of focus in CareCredit and purchase volume from repeat usage on the card grew 17% compared to last year. Reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Our CareCredit digital innovations continue to resonate with cardholders. The CareCredit app has been downloaded more than 350,000x and visited more than 2.3 million times since we launched it last fall. In addition, our provider locator averaged more than 800,000 hits per month in the first quarter. In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth.", "I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last year. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volumes up 17%, receivables up 13% and platform revenue up 13%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average spend, with purchase volume per average active account increasing 9% over last year as well as growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter last year, so that helped to improve our growth rate year-over-year.", "Net interest income was up 12% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up slightly, $10 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with growth in the programs as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. We typically see the RSA decline from the fourth quarter due to lower post-holiday related volumes. We still expect the RSA benefit on a full year basis to trend slightly under 4.5%. The provision increased $216 million compared to last year. While the increase was driven by receivables growth, we also had the benefit of a lower reserve build last year due to improved asset quality metrics. I will cover this in more in detail later.", "Asset quality metrics were relatively stable. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% compared to 3.79% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.70% compared to 4.53% last year. Credit metrics were in line with our expectations and consistent with the range we have seen in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of our receivables was 5.5%. Measured against the last four quarters\u2019 net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x, which is consistent with the coverage level over the past six quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were stable.", "Other income decreased $9 million versus last year. Higher loyalty and rewards costs were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $30 million, driven by continued growth in our store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $32 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $64 million were down $1 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel.", "Other expenses increased $54 million or 7% versus last year, more in line with the growth of the business. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.4%. The first quarter is typically the low point for the efficiency ratio due to marketing, business development and volume related expenses being at their lowest level for the year. The efficiency ratio will normally increase from these levels for the remainder of the year. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our strong performance drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.8%.", "I will move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.76% for the quarter, relatively stable to last year and the prior quarter. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The yield on receivables declined 21 basis points to 21.1%, reflecting higher payment rates and a slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions, where the yield is lower than our overall portfolio yield. The decline in receivables yield was offset by a slight benefit from rates earned in our liquidity portfolio due to higher short-term benchmark rates resulting from the Fed tightening in December. We also benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan facility.", "The cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.9% due to an increase from rising short-term benchmark rates and the costs of the senior unsecured debt issuance, which was largely offset by a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan and the payoff for the GE Capital loan last year. Our deposit base increased by over $10 billion or 29% year-over-year, we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 69% of our funding versus 59% last year. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.", "Next, I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continue to see relatively stable asset quality performance, which was generally in line with our expectations. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% versus 3.79% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.84% compared to 1.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% compared to 4.53% in the first quarter last year. Both the delinquency metrics and net charge-off levels are consistent with the results in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015. We continued to believe their performance is being sustained due in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%, down slightly from 5.59% last year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months\u2019 charge-offs, we are currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve, which is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we are seeing.", "Moving to Slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $800 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $41 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were down $16 million, driven primarily by lower third party expense as a result of our completion of the separation from GE. Marketing and business development costs were up $12 million. The higher costs were driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped to drive the strong growth in purchase volume receivables. Information processing was up $19 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter due to seasonal low points in marketing, business development and volume related expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year. However, we expect it to remain below 34% in line with what we communicated back in January.", "Moving to Slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continued to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we have grown our deposits by over $10 billion primarily for our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 69% of our funding, which is near the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved further towards the top end of our target leverage, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay. Given we are near the top end of our range and we expect to continue to drive deposit growth, we would expect deposits to move a little above 70% of our funding in the upcoming quarters. Longer term, once we reach our optimal mix of deposits, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivable growth.", "Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 19% of our funding. In March, we successfully issued $750 million in 3-year notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization of between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loan and senior unsecured notes now total 12% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy was to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this would become a more expensive source of funding for the business as rates start to rise. Given the significant growth in deposits, we made $2.7 billion of prepayments in the quarter and paid off the remaining $1.5 billion in early April. We are pleased to have fully paid this loan up well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.", "Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.1%, CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.4% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 110 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $22.2 billion and includes $14.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.3 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.", "I would also like to provide an update on our capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the timeline we have communicated on previous calls. Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We have built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.", "And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Brian. I will close with a summary of the quarter on Slide 11 and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we exhibited broad-based growth across key areas, signed and renewed important partnerships and expanded our network in the utility of our cards and continued to develop innovative solutions and value propositions to help drive sales. And our pipeline of additional opportunities remains strong. Our digital channels remain a key component of our overall strategy and we delivered strong growth both online and through our native app. We are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast growing deposit platforms and strong balance sheet.", "I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning, Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "Maybe we could start with your expectations for credit, first we did see charge-offs up slightly year-on-year, but yet still down from 2014 levels. And I was wondering is there any change to your call it relatively stable 430 to 450 guidance? And if not \u2013 and if so, how do we think about the trajectory of both provisions and charge-offs over the next few quarters?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure Ryan. So, I think it still feels like we are operating in a pretty stable environment when it comes to credit. We continue to think that losses will be stable for the balance of the year. We have been pretty clear that we don\u2019t expect them to get better from here. I think that\u2019s pretty consistent across the industry. If you look at the performance in the quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. If you look at the year-over-year comparison, you have to remember that we had a really strong first quarter last year, which was frankly is better than we expected. We only had a $19 million reserve build in the first quarter last year. So, really what you are seeing now is more of a normalization and generally more in line with our expectations. So, if you look at reserve coverage levels, they are also very consistent. Reserve coverage as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. It was down just 9 basis points from last year. If you look at the reserve coverage against last 12 months charge-offs, it was 1.29x versus 1.26x a year ago, so also very consistent. So, I think for the balance of the year, we continue to say our losses will be stable, an overall change to that 2-year kind of average that we gave in January.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. And maybe I can ask a question, Margaret, on the outlook for growth, both loan growth and the pipeline for new business wins. Maybe on loan growth, can you talk about how we should think about it from here, how much of the growth is coming from improving penetration rates versus new client wins? You highlighted a couple of times that the year-over-year growth from BP will subside next quarter. So, I just want to think \u2013 understand how to think about loan growth? And then the portfolio pipeline for new deals, can you maybe talk about potential startups and maybe any other portfolio deals that you are looking at?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. I think we have said in the past that we do have BP in the numbers. So that\u2019s a little bit of the growth. But the real growth is coming from organic growth and increased penetration. And throughout CareCredit 50% of the sales are repeat and Payment Solutions, we are seeing nice repeat. I think one of the key drivers of our results is really two things. One is the value props that we continue to enhance and drive into our retailers and we work closely with them to really develop those value propositions. And going back to what Brian saying about the consumer being stable on credit, I do think consumers continue to look for a reason to shop. So, having very strong value propositions is really key. The second is really all the innovation we continue to do on mobile. Our online sales overall, were up 29% year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a testament to the ability to apply and buy I think. And you combine that with the strong value propositions. I think this is why you are really seeing the kind of growth you are seeing. So, I would say most of it is through existing cardholders who are deepening their loyalty to the brand of that particular retailer. On the pipeline itself, our pipeline continues to remain robust. It\u2019s really a mix, I would say of startups as well as existing portfolios that we are looking to win. It\u2019s a combination of both. We have, as I said in the past, dedicated resources in all three platforms. We are working on our network, so in CareCredit being able to add RiteAid things like that. So very focused on the front end on winning deals and feel we have a good pipeline going forward.", "Ryan Nash", "Just as a very, very quick follow-up, have you disclosed what percentage of overall sales are mobile and online, just I am trying to get a sense for how fast that grew over the next few years?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes, we just do the combined digital, which is the 29%. And again, the bulk of the sales are still in store obviously, because that\u2019s the bulk of where people just continue to shop, but this metric continues to excel. And probably one of the case is when we see a consumer shop multi-channel, we definitely get higher penetration on the cards. So, if they shop in-store and online, for example, we know they are more loyal and intend to stay longer with us. So really working through all those channels is very important.", "Ryan Nash", "Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht", "Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. You guys provided a lot of the factors with respect to growth in the debt, but I am wondering can you talk about active account growth and average spend level trends and how these compared to recent quarters?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure, John. So, I would say the trends have picked up a little bit from recent quarters primarily around active account growth. So, the big thing for us relative to general purpose cards, we are always measuring active accounts and that obviously includes new accounts. Active accounts are more important for us, because we are trying to create those incentives for cardholders to use the card more often. We want to create value propositions that push our card more towards the top of wallet. And so if you look at purchase volume growth, about half of that came from higher spend per active account. That was up about 8.5% from the prior year and then the other half came from an increase in overall active accounts, up 7.5%. So, a lot of what we are doing around the value propositions is getting \u2013 we are getting consumers to use the card more often and they are also spending more on the card when they use it. So I think all those trends are moving \u2013 continue to move in the right direction, but they did get incrementally better this quarter from where we have been trending.", "John Hecht", "Okay. Thanks Brian. And you talked about the RSA and the seasonality and so forth. Is it \u2013 in thinking about the seasonality going forward, should we just think it kind of moves up so it ends up in the range of guidance throughout the year. And the second question with respect to the RSA business, 3-2-1 program at Walmart impact that at all?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. So let me just take the first one. The RSA would typically be fairly stable in the first half of the year. As I mentioned, just given we had a very small reserve build last year, and when that happens, our partners benefit from that. So if you compare against last year, we had a higher RSA percentage last year than what you saw. The RSA this quarter is actually probably more in line with what you should expect going forward. It\u2019s pretty stable in the second quarter. And then we always see a seasonal increase in the RSA percentage in the third quarter and it comes down a bit in the fourth quarter, but it is typically elevated in the second half of the year. And then your second question on Walmart, you will see \u2013 depending on how that plays out, it\u2019s still very early, but you will see any time we launch a value proposition, you typically see loyalty costs, interchange will increase and there is a partial offset in the RSA for those items. But I would continue to use slightly below 4.5% range for the year that we gave you.", "John Hecht", "Alright. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I know it\u2019s the first quarter, but the NIM is trending better than your guidance, is it fair to say that there is some upside given that trend, similar question for the efficiency ratio, understanding the seasonality, but can we hold kind of the year-over-year increase in that ratio?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. So let me just take NIM first. It was slightly above the 15.5% outlook due to the fact that we had really strong deposit growth. We did use some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan. So when you look at the average liquidity in the quarter compared to last year, it was a little bit lower. So those are all positives and some of those were factored in the guidance we gave you and some of them came in a little bit better. I think as you think about the rest of the year, if deposit growth continues at this pace, we could see some benefit there in our margins. We are always looking at ways to optimize liquidity, so there could be a slight benefit there. However, there would probably be a couple of offsets. One is we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. You saw that this quarter. And so you will see a little bit of an offset in our receivable yields. And then our guidance did include, if you remember, it included 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year. We had those in June and December. And so the markets pricing and maybe one rate increase. So that would be just a little bit of pressure on the guidance. So I think there are some put and takes, I wouldn\u2019t think about the margin for the balance of the year trending too significantly in either direction from the 15.76 we reported this quarter.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Okay. Efficiency ratio?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. And then on the efficiency ratio, obviously is very strong in the quarter, 30.4%. it\u2019s definitely going to trend up from here. There is no question. We benefited from having very strong revenue growth in the quarter. We didn\u2019t spend a lot on marketing and strategic investments. Those typically accelerate throughout the balance of the year. I m not going to give you any more specific guidance and we feel really good particularly how we started the year that we will stay below the annual guidance of below 34%. So I think that is \u2013 that\u2019s definitely a good number. We are really pleased with how we started the year, but I am not going to give any more specifics than what we said back in January.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Got it. Just one final question for Margaret, I guess one of the concerns I heard during the quarter and just a follow-up on one of the questions asked before, was that Walmart program and possibly kind of the rising costs to issuers as it relates to enhanced rewards, I mean can you just talk about how you guys think of the that, I understand that it\u2019s a share between the merchants as well, but maybe you could just articulate kind of what you guys are thinking in terms of strategy? Thanks.", "Margaret Keane", "Sure first of all I think we are always looking at ways to enhance value props, right, because the ultimate goal for both us and the partner is to grow the program. And if we grow the program through the sales and receivables, we all win. So that\u2019s kind of a fundamental. Whenever we do a launch like this, obviously we work closely with a partner. And in terms of the overall economics, there is economics in these deals that we can move around and Brian can talk a little more specifically about that if you want. So for us, the more we grow the program and the more we drive loyalty in the cards through those value proposition, the better we are off as well as the partner. We are pretty excited with this particular launch because it\u2019s a program that I think aligns very close to the strategic direction of Walmart, where they really want to drive online sales. So for us, this is a program that is a big launch and one we are excited about, one that I think we can grow the overall program. And when you grow the overall program, we all win. I don\u2019t know Brian, if you would add more on the economics.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. The only thing, I know you guys get this, but the costs of these value propositions run to the RSA, so the partner is sharing in the costs with us to drive growth in the program. And then the other thing that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, but we also set aside marketing and loyalty dollars in the programs and we jointly agreed with the partner on how to spend those dollars. So we can always reallocate from the marketing funds and maybe we will choose to do less one off promotions and shift some dollars into an everyday value prop. I think this is a really good example where we leverage our data analytics capabilities and we look at spending trends and customer insights to really determine the best way to use those marketing dollars to drive growth.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Pardon me, Betsy your line is open, perhaps you are muted.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, yes. Sorry, it\u2019s muted. Sorry. Good morning.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. So a couple of questions, one on the deposit side, you indicated that you have your goals on deposit funding, just wondering how close you believe you are to that and what would keep you from wanting to increase deposits as a percentage of total funding from here?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure Betsy. So we obviously continue to have really strong deposit growth. We are up $10 billion year-over-year or 29%. It\u2019s been fairly consistent over the past few quarters. I think the only new dynamic is that we did see an influent deposits this quarter when the Fed raised rates. We didn\u2019t move our rates, but I think the announcement of a rate hike prompted people to go check what they were earning in traditional savings account. And they decided to move some money around. So we did see a benefit from that in the quarter. In terms of the target range, we are at 69% of our total funding. We gave you a range of between 60% to 70%. So we are at the high end right now. In my earlier comments, I indicated that we are going to continue to grow deposits. We will probably grow deposits faster than we are growing our receivables, at least based on the market conditions that we see right now. So I would expect that deposit percentage to trend a little above 70% in the next few quarters. And then we are always looking at whether or not we should revisit that target and maybe take it up a little bit, but I think we are going to see how the rest of the year plays out before we do anything there.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And I would think your deposit growth is adding low cost funding relative to the other funding mix that you have got, so you are using that to drive incremental loan growth that is potentially a little more competitive. In other words, you are using the cheaper funding cost to drive more loan growth that is maybe a little bit more skewed towards value to your partners, is that fair?", "Brian Doubles", "Well, I think \u2013 if you think about the loan growth we are driving, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. If you just look at the straight receivable yield, it\u2019s pretty flat year-over-year, that was down 21 basis points. And that \u2013 again that\u2019s primarily driven by higher payment rates that we are seeing across the portfolio and then more growth in Payment Solutions. So I wouldn\u2019t attribute really any of it to the competitive environment. If you look at loyalty cost and you really have to look at loyalty costs in conjunction with the RSA and some of the marketing spend. We are going to continue to launch attractive value proposition to drive growth. I wouldn\u2019t think about it direct tie-in with deposits. We are kind of \u2013 we look at them separately. We are trying to fund the balance sheet in a very cost effective way and deposits are very cost effective for us. We are going to continue to drive deposits. And then we are making different decisions when we look at the retail programs and how to drive growth. So, our yields should continue to be pretty stable, but for the two dynamics that I mentioned earlier, really strong growth in Payment Solutions and slightly higher payment rates.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. And the just a follow-up on the credit questions that you got earlier, it sounded to me like 1Q result in NCS was more seasonal, I know we saw in the master trust data March improved versus February. So, my takeaway is that seasonality should drive down the NCS as we move into second and third quarter. I don\u2019t know if you would agree with that. And maybe you could speak to the fact that delinquencies have been coming down in the 30-day and 90-day buckets and what the implications are for the forward look from your perspective?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. If you remember back in January, we tried to be pretty clear that we didn\u2019t expect the favorability we saw kind of in the first half of 2015 to continue when we gave you how to think about the provision. And if you look at \u2013 so, if you look at the net charge-offs in the quarter, I just go back in the first quarter of 2014, net charge-offs were 4.86%. In the first quarter of 2015, they were 4.53% and we are at 4.7% this quarter, so smacked out in the middle of that range that we gave you back in January. So, I think that was pretty good guidance and we came in right in line with our expectations and that\u2019s why we gave you a range for the year. We said credit will be stable, but it will be stable to like a 2-year range in that 4.3% to 4.5% kind of level. And reserves will grow in line with receivables and that\u2019s absolutely what we saw this quarter and you are seeing very stable reserve coverage metrics.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. Thanks. Brian, you talked about the breakdown of kind of existing accounts versus kind of new accounts in the spending. I guess maybe to be a little bit more basic, the 17% obviously benefited this quarter by the leap year and there might have been some funky things a year ago. What do you think the underlying actual growth rate is and maybe talk a little bit about your share at retailers and how that\u2019s moving?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure. So, if you adjust for day count, purchase volume will move from 17% to 15% growth. Year-over-year, platform revenue will move from 13% to 12%. So, that\u2019s the impact I think even adjusting for day count, we had really strong growth in the quarter. The purchase volume per average active was up, so consumer spending more average balance per active account was up as well. So, we are still seeing good revolve on the accounts. Overall, very positive trends. I think the thing to think about as you try and figure out the back half of the year starting in the second quarter, the comps will get a little bit tougher for us. We have got the BP portfolio, Guitar Center we also had the Amazon 5% value prop. So, you got to factor those in as you think about the second half of the year, but we are really pleased with how we started. We didn\u2019t get a ton of help from retail sales. They were pretty much more the same, more of what we have been seeing. So, we are definitely taking share. We are definitely outperforming. If you look at the total credit card balances over the past 5 years, it\u2019s about $900 billion of balances and they have been growing it about 3%. Our growth over that same time period is 9%. And so there is no question that we are taking share in the market.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. And you had mentioned Citgo, are there other programs that are going to be kind of ramping in the second half?", "Brian Doubles", "No, I think that\u2019s the one. And again it\u2019s a relatively modest deal. So, we will have probably a tougher comp from BP and Guitar Center. Citgo won\u2019t totally offset that. So, the comp will get tougher, but the core organic growth is really strong and we obviously hope to have some more program wins in the back half of the year and we will announce those when we get them done.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Maybe from a big picture perspective, you talked a little bit about the Walmart program and the sharing of the RSA, so maybe you just talk philosophically about that kind of a relationship versus program relationship with how it might be different in addition to just the shares in RSA?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes, I think probably the key thing or the difference between the co-brand and the pure like Walmart example is really the engagement that you really get at the top. And I think in all of our big programs, the most important thing is for us to really connect with the strategy that, that particular retailer or partner is really trying to drive. And so the engagement both from an analytics and marketing perspective is just so high. You don\u2019t necessarily always get that same connection when you are doing the co-brand. So, I think that makes a big difference. I think the other thing that all retailers are really facing is how do they reach out to their target markets. And I think the fact that we had this 29% online growth overall year-over-year is certainly a way for us to really continue to connect with the partners, because the reality is consumers are shopping differently. So, I think really be engaged at the strategy level with the retailer is probably one of the, I think bigger differences between what we are doing on that side versus generic co-brand.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question, Brian, on the seasonality that you talked about on Slide 8. So, it looks like the allowance, the reserve rate is essentially peaks in the first quarter and we saw that in \u201815 and then it kind of gradually decreases again before peaking in the first quarter of the next year. And as we have been looking at year-over-year trends that reserve rate has actually been following every single one of the periods that are shown here. And similarly first quarter \u201816 fell over first quarter \u201815. But at some point, should we expect the year-over-year to reflect an increase similar to kind of what the charge-off rates up above. We had been seeing year-over-year declines. Now this quarter we saw year-over-year increase. So, when should we for modeling purposes expect that to happen for the reserve rate as well?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Well, if you go back to what we said in January, we pretty much indicated that we thought the coverage metrics would be stable. So, if you go back and compare against the prior year, we are seeing that stability. So, even though we saw 9 basis points of improvement or I guess the lowering of the reserve coverage from the first quarter \u201815 to the first quarter \u201816, from our perspective that\u2019s like dead stable. That\u2019s very consistent. And so I think you are going to start to see that normalization as you go and compare the prior quarter from the prior year. So, I think you are seeing it now. I would tell you to look at both the reserve coverage as a percent of the receivables as well as look at the reserves as a percent of or against last 12 months in net charge-offs. And if you triangulate those two, we think they will be pretty stable for the balance of the year.", "Bill Carcache", "Great, thanks. And if I may an industry level question for you, Margaret, so there has been, I guess a lot of focus on the friction in the payments ecosystem that certain players like PayPal have created by getting customers to fund their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts effectively disintermediating Visa and MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. And if you extend that thought process part of the Synchrony value proposition to its retail partners is not charging interchange on their private label transactions. And in the sense, one could argue that private label is effectively disintermediating general purpose cards, but there doesn\u2019t \u2013 and of course, we have seen some private label market share gains over the last decade or so, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be as much friction between Synchrony and Visa MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. So, I was hoping maybe you could just speak to the health of your relationship with the payment networks and then maybe also just touch on some of those dynamics.", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. I think we are working very closely with all those guys. I think at the end of the day, how a consumer is going to decide how they make their payment is going to be up to them, right? So, I think the position we have taken is that all of the players that you talked about are really partners of ours, including PayPal by the way, where we offer our credit programs. So for us, it\u2019s really about getting our cards in the wallet, whatever that wallet is, to be top of wallet and to get consumer to use it more. And I think the connection we have with merchants I think is very different than many of the players out there. And I think that\u2019s the value we bring even to some of the partners you talked about, like Visa or MasterCard and PayPal, right? So, we have that very tight connection with the merchant. And so we see this all as upside for us and continue to see that whole payment landscape as an opportunity for us to be in the forefront and continue to invest and we will continue to invest to be leaders in that.", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.", "David Ho", "Thanks. Good morning. Just circling back on the credit, Margaret, have we seen some \u2013 within the industry some pressure from merchants, retailers to basically increase the funnel, widen that out a little bit to drive volumes and maybe a little tick up in non-prime credit duration for those customers, down in the lower FICO spectrums, can you remind us how you guys tend to offset this with existing partners or with new RFPs or de novo and are you seeing that pressure to be a little looser on credit?", "Margaret Keane", "We are not seeing that. Our partners are not asking us to go deeper. I think we have been very consistent since the crisis in our underwriting. We have not changed underwriting. Our portfolio has remained fairly consistent since 2011. So I think this is where the goal should be not going necessarily deeper, but ensuring that you are bringing the value and sales in an up way through marketing, through being innovative, through driving channel integration and really working it that way. We control underwriting. It\u2019s something that we feel we have to do when we to our contracts. So that\u2019s something that I think is really important from a safety and soundness perspective from our bank. And we work with the retailers. There is many other ways to grow programs without having to necessarily always dig deeper. And I don\u2019t know Brian, if you had mentioned really how the portfolio...", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. I mean the underwriting profile is very consistent with where it\u2019s been and the average FICO by account is 711, exactly flat to last year. 78% of the new accounts since 2010 our prime credits above 660 FICO. And that\u2019s flat to last year as well. So the overall credit profile continues to be very stable.", "David Ho", "That\u2019s helpful. And separately on Amazon, obviously you have gotten some really nice digital online growth. Now, are you seeing that volume come in as transactors versus revolvers and the reason I ask is obviously it\u2019s a private label program, so you don\u2019t earn any interchange, but you are obviously paying fairly high rewards. So part of that does get offset in the RSA realized, but are you getting the revolved activity that you were expecting in that relationship?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. When we \u2013 obviously, when we launched that new value proposition, we did a lot of modeling initially because we knew that through the door population and people applying for the accounts was going to change. And so that\u2019s part of the reason why, if you remember, when we launched it, we launched it with a soft launch because we wanted to monitor the mix of consumers and we wanted to make sure that we were sizing lines appropriately, that it was a good experience for the prime customer that we are generating increment sales for Amazon. And so we have a lot of things that we are measuring. But one of the big ones for the credit program was revolver versus transactors. And we have monitored. It\u2019s coming in pretty close to what we forecast. So far, very much in line with our expectations. And obviously, the point you made is a good one which is part of why you see loyalty expense growing a little bit faster than interchange because that\u2019s the program where we do have a very attractive value proposition, but we don\u2019t charge interchange to Amazon. So there is an offset in the RSA. It\u2019s all part of that restructuring of that agreement and part of the extension that we do at Amazon when we launch the new value proposition.", "David Ho", "Sure. And one more follow-up on that if I may, are you seeing a general trend broadly that merchants are more willing to fund a larger portion of the value from the high rewards earned now that they have seen \u2013 that they have gotten some good engagement and account activity?", "Margaret Keane", "I think that varies retailer by retailer, but I think if you take the whole formula of what we do, the retailer is always looking to fund greater loyalty to their brand and their card. And we have retailers who take some of the earnings off the RSA and plough it right back into additional offers. So it varies across. I think the reality is right now everyone is \u2013 Brian mentioned it early, retailer sales have not been necessarily stellar. So our retailers and our partners are really looking to us to work with them to really make sure we are continuing to get right offers out there. But the retailers are high. The more engaged the retailer is, usually the better the program performance is.", "Brian Doubles", "It\u2019s not really a new phenomenon. You have to remember, we did low as 5% off a few years back. I think you are seeing more of this now, but it\u2019s a mix as well. It\u2019s maybe doing a little bit less one-off promotions, doing more on an everyday value prop. Again, this is where we are using our data analytics to really determine what is the best value proposition to get the consumer to come and to spend more. And so we are always looking at optimizing that mix between the one-off promotion and the everyday value prop.", "David Ho", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.", "Mark DeVries", "I just wanted to start with a quick follow-up on Amazon, are you any closer now to a harder rollout on that program?", "Brian Doubles", "Mark, we are in full rollout now. That really happened over holiday. The marketing around it is targeted marketing and Amazon controls a lot of that. But the program is performing very well in line with our expectations and we are pleased with the marketing and the advertising around it.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Are you seeing volumes accelerate as a result of that?", "Brian Doubles", "We continue to see good volumes on the Amazon program. Obviously, can\u2019t get real specific around it, but we are really excited when we launched it and it\u2019s performing in line with our expectations.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay, great. And I was hoping turning to the Walmart 3-2-1, I was hoping you could comment at least a high level on kind of your level of optimism that, that could really enhance your tender share there because this is a pretty substantial enhancement of the rewards prop relative to the old card, which is pretty modest. We have always \u2013 I am sorry go ahead.", "Margaret Keane", "No, I would say that\u2019s why we are pretty excited. We have been working with Walmart since 1999 and most of the value prop on the card has been kind of more pulsing promotional types of things like $0.05 or $0.10 off gas or something like that or some of the types of offerings. So to get a consistent value prop, that\u2019s \u2013 everyday use is really a big deal, because that\u2019s when the consistency and the usage of the card goes up. And obviously, Walmart is a big retailer, so we are pretty excited about it.", "Mark DeVries", "Yes, fair enough. So given the massive size of them, could you give us some sense of what even just a modest increase in tender share can mean to loan growth?", "Brian Doubles", "Well, it\u2019s hard for us to get specific around an individual program. Mark, you can take a look at what Walmart sales are in the U.S. and you can calculate your own percentage, but its Walmart continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay, great. And then just one last question if I may, given you are only one quarter in, but we had 13% loan growth and guidance is for 7% to 9% receivable growth, does that just feel a little bit conservative here or even if you take away \u2013 you lap the comps on BP, Guitar Center, you are still probably 11% or so, you would have to see a pretty material slowing in growth through the end of the year just to get to the high end of the range and that\u2019s what the backdrop of like some really solid momentum around things like Amazon and Walmart just hoping you could comment on that?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter. We are really pleased with the overall growth. The only thing I would point out is the back half the comps get tougher. If the trends continue, we can be a little bit better. We re really pleased, when we look across the portfolio, all three platforms growing really well, all the underlying dynamics in line or better than what we expected. So we are really pleased with how we started the year. We are not going to update guidance. And I would just remind you that the comps get a little bit tougher. But as you pointed out, the start of the year has been really strong.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Thanks.", "Greg Ketron", "Vanessa, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.", "Don Fandetti", "Margaret, you guys have been in a pretty good position in terms of most of your deals being locked up until 2019, when should we start thinking about the risk of early renewals, because if we look at some of the deals that have traded recently, knowing that some of them have been more inter-banked, the ROAs are a lot lower. And so how would you handle that and could retailers come to you and say look, we would like to renew earlier, there is better pricing, could you comment on that?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes. So I think you have to put this in the context of kind of the overall portfolio and how we manage it. And we are always looking to extend relationships. We never let the relationship go to the end of the term before we start having dialogue. In most cases, something comes up like a new value prop launch that\u2019s very significant or they want to roll out a Dual Card or something like that. So I would just say that this is a constant part of how we manage the overall portfolio and we are always engaging with partners to ensure that we renew them before the end of the term. I think we will have to see how the competitive environment plays out. I think this is where we have to do a really good job delivering for our customers and really ensuring that we actually give them no recent RFP and try to engage with them as early as possible. And we have had great success with that over the long-term relationships that we have had.", "Don Fandetti", "Okay, great. That\u2019s all I have.", "Margaret Keane", "Okay. I just want to clarify one point. I mentioned the 29%. I just want to make sure people know. Its online sales were up 29% year-over-year. And if you compare that to what\u2019s happening overall in the industry, that\u2019s about 14% to 15%, so it\u2019s online sales. I don\u2019t want to confuse anyone there, because I might have got misinterpreted, so just want to clarify.", "Greg Ketron", "Yes.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Ketron, you may begin.", "Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call.

After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions.", "Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.", "I'll begin on slide three. Second quarter net earnings totaled $489 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. Purchase volume grew 9%, loan receivables grew 11%, and net interest income grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. Our online and mobile purchase volume also continued its strong growth trajectory. Second quarter sales grew 27% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range.", "As per asset quality metrics, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year. And our net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% in the second quarter of last year. Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 4% over last year and were largely driven by the growth we are producing. We generated positive operating leverage and our overall efficiency ratio improved 157 basis points to 31.9%. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $46 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources, and know this is slightly above our original target range of 60% to 70%. We plan to continue to drive deposit growth by offering competitive rates, outstanding customer service, and a continued enhancement of our product suite. One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full scale online bank.", "Given our significant deposit growth, we were able to fully pay-off our bank term loan on April 5, well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Our balance sheet remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.5%, and liquid assets totaling $14 billion or 70% of total assets at quarter end. The strength of our balance sheet and financial performance has enabled us to start returning capital to shareholders. As we announced earlier this month, our board approved the $0.13 quarterly dividend and has $952 million annual share repurchase program. We will now begin to opportunistically repurchase our stock and look forward to building on these actions, as we look to deploy capital through both growth of the business and return to shareholders.", "Moving to business highlights, we recently renewed several key relationships, including Ashley HomeStores, Suzuki, VCA Animal Hospitals, and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We also continued to sign partnerships in the travel and entertainment space. We won a new U.S. based program with Cathay Pacific Airways. We also signed a new program with Fareportal, one of the largest and fastest growing online travel companies. These programs add to our growing T&E portfolio, that already includes recently launched programs with (05:44) and Marvel Entertainment. The launch of our new program with Marvel this quarter includes an attractive cash back value proposition, where the greatest benefits are accrued on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks.", "We are excited about these new partnerships as we believe this is a segment that provides attractive opportunities and we are pleased to extend our presence in it. We also launched a new program with Mattress Firm, one of the nation's premier specialty bedding retailers. We continue to be highly focused on driving organic growth and pursuing new opportunities to grow our business. We are working closely with our current partners to deliver incremental value and drive program growth and provide value to our cardholders.", "Moving to slide four, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. Previously, we had reported platform revenue, but starting with this quarter we will utilize interest and fees on loans as a means of discussing our business performance favoring this GAAP measure that more closely aligns with the growth metrics of our business. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to our partners and cardholders via attractive value proposition, promotional financing and marketing office.", "On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the second quarter, as shown on slide five. Retail Card generated another strong quarter of results, receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8%, and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The strong growth in Retail Card continued to be broad-based as we serve growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnerships with Cathay Pacific and Fareportal, and the launch of the new Marvel program.", "We have developed strong long-term relationships that solidify our position in the space, and provide the foundation for the addition of new partnerships and the expansion into new sectors, such as travel and entertainment. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 16%, and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The majority of the industries, where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We had a very active quarter with the renewal of key relationships with Ashley HomeStores and Suzuki and the launch of the Mattress Firm program. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions, which represented 26% of purchase volume in the second quarter.", "CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10%, and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 5%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties, and we are pleased to renew an important veterinary partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals, as well as our strategic partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card also continues to be an area of focus, and reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop extent and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders.", "I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 9%, receivables up 11%, and interest and fees on loans up 10%. Average active accounts increased 8% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions on our card, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average balances and spend, with growth and average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year.", "The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $281 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth, which I'll cover in more detail later. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and slightly better than 2Q, 2014 of 3.82%. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year, and 4.88% in 2Q 2014. Delinquencies were consistent with the range we have seen in the second quarter over the past two years, with net charge-offs staying lower than the range.", "Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.70%. As we noted in June, we expected the allowance to increase 20 basis points to 30 basis points in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter level of 5.5%. RSAs were up $43 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter, compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with the growth in the programs, as well as the incremental reserve build, which more than offset incremental sharing on the year-over-year improvements and net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio.", "Given the increase in the reserve level, we expect the RSA percentage on a full-year basis to trend closer to the 4.2% to 4.3% range. Other income decreased $37 million versus last year. In the prior year, there was a $20 million gain on portfolio sales which should not (12:31) repeat. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to higher loyalty and rewards costs that were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. While interchange was up $28 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store (12:45) spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that was up $41 million, primarily driven by new value propositions, including the Walmart 3-2-1 value prop. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.", "Other expenses increased $34 million or 4% versus last year. Now, that we are comparing to periods where the infrastructure build is largely in a run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth, as well as strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.9%, which was 157-basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and staying disciplined on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating a ROA of 2.4%.", "I'll move to slide seven and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10% driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.86% for the quarter, up 9 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are few dynamics worth highlighting. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. The yield on receivables declined 14 basis points to 21%, reflecting the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth and promotional balances, particularly in Payment Solutions.", "The cost of funding was up 7 basis points to 1.9%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we make growing our direct deposit platform; deposits are now 71% of our funding versus 61% last year. The second quarter margin was 15.86%, which was 9 basis points better than last year, and slightly better than the first quarter of 15.76%. And as we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect it to be fairly stable for the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.", "Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. The backdrop for credit is still favorable. However, our forecast indicates that credit will gradually normalize higher from the recent lows. It's important to note that we are not seeing a step change. Our view takes into consideration factors like portfolio mix, as well as account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. We consider all of these factors in our underwriting today, and we're still seeing very attractive returns across the credit spectrum. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and 90-plus day delinquencies were 1.67% compared to 1.52% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past two years.", "The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year, and 4.88% in 2Q 2014. The net charge-offs were somewhat lower than the range we had experienced over the past two years. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.7% in the second quarter, in line with the range we provided in June. This results in the allowance coverage of approximately 13 months to 15 months of expected charge-offs, which should be fairly consistent going forward. So as you think about credit normalization from here, we expect net charge-offs will be around 4.5% in 2016, which is largely in line with our guidance for the year, and we've indicated that we expect net charge-offs to trend 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher over the next four quarters, which should be helpful as you think about 2017.", "So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment when it comes to credit, and the risk adjusted yields we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. Moving to slide nine, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $839 million for the quarter, a 4% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $51 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation, as well as growth of the business.", "This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under the GE TSA. Professional fees were down $2 million, this is primarily driven by growth in the business, which was more than offset by the reduction in third-party services mentioned previously, as well as expenses related to last year's EMV rollout, which did not repeat. Marketing and business development costs were down $1 million, higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive strong growth in purchase volume receivables, were offset by lower marketing costs, related to our deposit platform, as well as redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense.", "Information processing was up $7 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expenses down $21 million due to benefits from EMV, as well as a reduction in TSA costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE. The efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, 157 basis points lower than last year, as the business drove positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume related expenses in the second half of the year, as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, we expected to remain below 34% in line with what we communicated back in January.", "Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as recap our capital plan. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This put deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit funding. And while we have now moved slightly over the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities.", "Longer term we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products over the next couple of years, such as check-in (20:16) and online bill pay. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, and is now 18% of our funding. In May, we successfully issued $600 million in five-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding.", "Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources. This reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April, well ahead of the contractual maturity in 2019. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in May we did issue $500 million and 18-month floating rate notes. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules, and 18% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 150 bps over the past year.", "Total liquidity increased to $21 billion, and includes $14 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional $7 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. Before I wrap up, I wanted to recap our initial capital plan actions we announced on July 7. Our board approved a $0.13 quarterly common stock dividend, as well as a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017.", "We expect to make sure repurchase is subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Our board also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share payable on August 25 to holders of record at the close of business on August 12. Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we're very pleased to be in a position to begin returning capital to our shareholders.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a summary of the quarter on slide 11, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we again delivered significant growth across key areas of our business. We signed, renewed, and launched a number of important partnerships, and further expanded the breath of business segments we are serving, and our pipeline of additional opportunities remain strong. Our digital channels remain a key component of our overall strategy, and we've delivered strong growth there as well. And to support our growth, we are successfully expanding our deposit base and increasing its importance as a source of our overall funding. Our strong capital position and performance has enabled us to begin to return capital to our shareholders, a goal that we are very pleased to have achieved.", "I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call.", "Operator, please start the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "Morning, guys. Thanks very much. First, with respect to credit, obviously, you guys gave us revised guidance a few weeks back, but the quarter reflected fairly strong kind of year-over-year credit trends. Just for, I guess, sort of ratification, when should we see the pace is in sales (24:45) pick up based on what you're seeing in delinquencies and low rate trends at this point?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah John, you cut out in (24:55) room a little bit, but I think your question was around 2Q credit being a little bit better than you expected. Is that right?", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "Correct. And then, what pace should we see it start to normalize given the delinquency and low rates?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah, sure. So I would disconnect the guidance a little bit from what happened in the quarter. In the quarter, we had a little bit higher recoveries. If you look over the past two year's recoveries, it'd been running in the 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables kind of range. This quarter, they are right around 1.3%, so that drove a bit of the improvement. Going forward and what was included in our guidance is that recoveries would be pretty similar to where they've been in the last two years, so somewhere in that 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables. So that's really what was contemplated in the forward guidance. So no change to what we said in June, we gave you kind of what we think we're going to close the year at for 2016 at around 4.5%, and then starting kind of incrementally year-over-year 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the first quarter and the second quarter of 2017.", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Thanks for the color there. And then just thinking about net interest margin, obviously there was a little bit of benefit this quarter because of the ratio of liquid assets to receivables. Are you able to kind of further optimize that, or how should we think about the movement there, and what that means to margin in the near-term?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah. The net interest margin came in pretty similar to where we were in the first quarter. At that point, we had paid down the bank term loan, so we were able to optimize liquidity a bit, and take some of that excess and pay down the bank term loan. We're obviously really pleased with that, and we thought jumping off in the first quarter the margin would be pretty stable for the balance of the year, which was right around, I think 15.75%. We still think that's a pretty good way to think about the back half of the year. If deposit growth continues at this pace, we'll get a small benefit there. We might be able to do a little bit more on liquidity, but probably not much.", "If you look at the year-over-year we have been able to improve the yield that we're earning on the cash and the treasuries. But then there is some, what I would call, modest offsets to those two positives. One, we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. As you know, those are our promotional balances, so those come on initially at a lower yield. And then our guidance initially back in January included a small benefit from another 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year, and obviously that looks a little bit less likely. So some few puts and takes, I would say, but the margins should be pretty stable for the back half of the year.", "John Hecht - Jefferies LLC", "Great. I appreciate the details. Thanks.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Good morning.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Maybe I could start-off with a question on the RSA, Brian. It was down 30 basis points year-over-year, and I think it's around 4% in the first half versus a guide for 4.2% to 4.3%, and that implies the RSA will be roughly in line with the back half of last year, give or take couple of basis points. So I guess, all else equal that would probably \u2013 my math, that implies either provision in the back half of this year that's similar to last year, or we get continued improvement in efficiency. So can you just maybe help us understand, why the RSA would go back up to the second half of last year's level, given how much it's come down in the first half or is it just being conservative on the guidance?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, I think, there is a few things. So if we just \u2013 let's just break down the quarter maybe a little bit on the RSA. The RSA obviously included an offset on the reserve build, that's why you saw it down year-over-year, that's why we revised the guidance on RSAs from round 4.5% to 4.2% to 4.3%. You also have to remember that a lot of things in the P&L got better year-over-year. So we had obviously better revenue, margins were little bit better, efficiency ratio was better as you indicated. So all else being equal, that would have resulted in a higher RSA percent compared to last year.", "And then those improvements were both more than offset by the higher reserve build and the higher provision. And the one thing, I'm not sure you're taking into account, as you think about the back half of the year, the third quarter is typically the high watermark on the RSA. We've got some seasonality, and if you look back over the past two years you do see the RSA percentage trend up a bit in the third quarter seasonally. So as you think about the back half, you've got to factor that end, but that's all included in the outlook for the 4.2% to 4.3% for the year.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then, maybe I could ask a follow up on credit. You talked about losses at 4% or 5%, and then up 20% to 30% be for the four quarters after. Can you maybe just give us a sense of how much the upward bias on losses is actually coming from higher growth, so we've all heard about various banks talk about the impact of seasoning on portfolios, how much is actually coming from lower late stage QR rates that you talked about? And just, we're obviously up this year and next year and I know you don't have a crystal ball of three years. But at what level would you actually expect losses to begin to start leveling off assuming growth levels off?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah. I mean, there is a lot of factors here and some of these are obviously cause and effect. In June, our comments indicated that we're expecting to see this modest increase in net charge-offs. As part of that, we focus specifically around the payment behaviors that we are driving the reserve build in the quarter. Now, we're giving you some broader context on some of the dynamics that we take into account when we build the forecast. And those are things like portfolio mix, like platform, product, program, channel, as well as account maturation or seasoning of vintages, as well as the overall consumer trends.", "Now, I would say, if you look at seasoning of vintages for us, it absolutely plays out similarly in private label as it does for general purpose cards. So we typically see peak losses at around 24 months. I think that's pretty consistent with the rest of the industry. However, our growth rates have been more consistent than I think others. So while it certainly plays a factor in what we're seeing in our expectation, our growth rates haven't been perfectly consistent. So I'd say, it's a factor, but it's a not a significant, I think for us is what you're seeing for others out there.", "Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Sure, Ryan.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, Margaret, I was wondering if you can comment on the pipeline of potential portfolio partnership acquisitions. And then can you talk a little bit about on these larger deals, what your competitive advantage is versus your larger peer, and kind of how you approach those types of transactions?", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So I'd say overall our pipeline continues to be robust. I think, I've mentioned in past calls that we have dedicated resources in each of our three platforms, and I think you can tell, by even this quarter we won some nice deals. We feel competitively in the $500 million to $1 billion portfolio size. The competition is pretty reasonable, and we really compete effectively there. When you get to the bigger portfolios, obviously the cost goes, an example of that, it gets much more competitive. I would say, overall on the bigger deals that are out there or people are discussing, I think, we start by competing on our capabilities and the history and the level of experience that we have in the industry, and that's how most of these conversations start. I would say, we generally win on those types of things.", "We feel that some of the things we've invested in, in the last couple of years, particularly around online and digital mobile are really playing to our advantage. We feel we're further ahead than the competition there. I think the other area that we're continuing to invest in is really the whole data analytics portion of the business, and really leveraging some new technology there. So on a capability point of view, I think, we have a couple of areas where I think we're a little ahead. We are very partner focused. And I think, the key relationships we have today really help reiterate with potential partners how we worked with our partners, and that I think is another advantage. So I think it's overall capabilities, experience and long-term relationships and partnerships that we have.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And on program deals like Cathay Pacific, can you talk a little bit? I mean, on one hand it's very good for your loan growth, but I wonder if that's a slightly more competitive segment, and can you talk a little bit about how you won that deal and the returns relative to private label transactions?", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Co-brand is a little more competitive. But I think we're not \u2013 our strategy is really to look at co-brand and Dual Card opportunities in the business that meet our returns. So Cathay and Fareportal being the other one for this quarter, again, it started out with our capabilities and our partnering experience, and that's really how we won both of those deals. When we look at overall return, every deal that we do, we make sure it's kind of competitive with any overall return for our business, and we look to ensure that we're keeping that return in mind, as we take our new opportunities. I don't know Brian, if you'll add anything on returns.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah. The only thing I would say Don is, you're going to see us be pretty selective around co-brand opportunities. We like the space, but we're going to be cautious around it. You're probably not going to see us go after the really big marquee deals, but we're, as Margaret said, we can go in and compete and demonstrate our capabilities and win on that basis, and still earn an attractive return. We're going to go after those deals.", "Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. In past quarters, Margaret, you've had more commentary on the digital channels. I was wondering if you could share some of the metrics that you've had in the past, or at least qualitatively describe some of the trajectory you're seeing there.", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So I'll just say that, the digital channels continue to be important, as more and more consumers are active on the digital channel. Our online sales for the quarter were up 27% versus the second quarter last year. Approximately a third of our applications now occur digitally, and if you go back to 2012 to current, we've received over 11 million mobile applications, and that's growing at about 78% year-over-year. So if you compare us to the industry, I think our growth is much stronger. The industry overall is reporting somewhere around 14% to 15%. And I think this is an area where the question earlier of how we compete, I think this is an area where extraordinarily important for us to ensure we're investing. We have a position with GPShopper. We've been able to leverage that partnership and help our partners, actually get out mobile applications sooner where we're fully integrated into the application. So those are the types of things that I think as industries shift from brick-and-mortar to more online, we just have to be the best-in-class on those types of things.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you. And I just want to ask one follow up Greig, about the OpEx seasonality, if you could share some perspective on that.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah, sure. This is Brian. I assume (37:13), but if you want to hear from Greig, I can put him on.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Well, I'm sorry (37:15).", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "I'm happy to put him on the line as well.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I apologize Brian.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "That's all right. So we obviously delivered, I think a pretty strong efficiency ratio in the first half of the year. What I would tell you this quarter is similar to what I told you last quarter, which is we do expect the efficiency ratio to rise from here in the back half of the year, really for two reasons; we do more marketing and promotions in the second half of the year, particularly around holiday, and so that will drive an increase in the efficiency ratio. And we also have more of our strategic investment spend stacked against the second half of the year as well. So as those investments come in throughout the year, we would expect the ratio to increase, but we'll still be within the annual guidance of below 34% for the year.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you very much.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks guys for taking my question this morning. I'd love to sort of circle back on the questions related to RSA, and uses as an opportunity, perhaps refine the way we think about this. Brian, I realized you gave guidance and that's really helpful. But I'd love to delve into the mechanics here. When we look at the interest income and fees quarter-over-quarter, those were roughly flat. Provision was up about a $100 million. That would suggest assuming that there is a 50%-50% share on the RSAs that you would expect roughly a $50 million decline in RSA expense. We didn't see that, that wasn't our assumption either. But I'd love to talk through, is it an accrual issue, is it a timing issue, how do we think about this on a dollar basis as opposed to a percentage basis?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah. Rick, part of the reason why we did give you some guidance on this is, as we recognized that it's very hard for you to model based on the information you have, and part of the reason for that is that, all of our deals are very unique, very customized both in terms of the percentage sharing, as well as the level at which we start to share with the retail partner, and for obvious reasons, we can't provide any visibility around those contractual terms. And our retailers also have seasonality. And so there are number of moving pieces that make it difficult for you to model it and to have that transparency, so we give you a guidance range for the year. What you should be able to see from the quarterly results is that, when things get better we tend to share more, when things get worse we share less with the retail partners, that dynamic whether you're looking at it as a percent of receivables, or a percent of pre-tax earnings excluding RSA, those ratios hold, I would say, fairly consistent, but for the seasonal components that I mentioned.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "So I know that's not particularly helpful in terms of how you're going to model it, but I would just continue to use the guidance that we're giving you. I think that's probably the best way for you guys to get it right.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Just one follow up to that. When we think about the \u2013 let's assume that it's an ROA threshold. Is it on a trailing 12 months basis, or does it true up every quarter in terms of how you accrue it?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "For the most part assume that it stood (40:49) up in the quarter.", "Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. Recognizing that you don't give specific EPS guidance, can you speak to your confidence level and your ability to grow earnings in the current credit environment if the current environment holds, and you don't necessarily see further declines in unemployment, but you also don't see increases? It seems to us like your business model enables you to still be able to generate healthy EPS growth in this environment, particularly once you start layering in the upside from capital return, but I think there are some concerns around that, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, Bill, I think the fundamentals of the business are still very strong, if you, let's just walk down \u2013 we'll walk down the income statement and look at some of the key indicators. Net interest margin is stable to improving. We feel good about the margins, the resiliency of the margins, RSAs act as an offset to other things that are going on in the P&L. We drove fairly significant operating leverage, and I think we're fairly optimistic going forward that we'll be able to continue to do that, particularly given that the infrastructure growth spend, that's all in the run-rate. We're really focused on driving operating leverage going forward.", "And then we're using some of the savings to invest in the long-term ideas and strategies, and things like mobile and data analytics, but this is a scalable platform, and we should be able to drive that operating leverage going forward. So then you're really left with what is the outlook on credit, and we've given you a view on that as well in terms of what we're seeing. So I'd say, you've got a whole bunch of positives, and then we're going to build reserves based on growth in the business as well as our expectation in net charge-offs, and we'll continue to do that. But I think that, that adds up to a pretty positive outlook, generally, for the business.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Thank you. That's really helpful. If I may ask one follow up on credit. Just it looks like you guys are reserved at very healthy levels. And if just looking at yourself \u2013 you guys relative to peers, Capital One, which reported last night is running with reserve coverage of about 12 months in its domestic card segment, while you guys are running, well, north of that, you have less subprime exposure. Can you help us understand why you guys are running with what looks to be relatively higher reserve coverage versus some others?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, obviously, I can't speak to how others reserve, that I can't do, but I can tell you that our reserve is based on our best estimate of the incurred losses that we believe exist in the book at the end of the reporting period. Our models generally look out over a 12-month window. They include our expectations for net charge-offs. We also include qualitative and other factors. And our reserve coverage, we don't book to a specific number of months, but it typically falls in that 13 months to 15 months of expected net charge-offs. So other than that, I mean, there is some really good disclosure in the Q is that, you can look at that kind of talks about the other factors that we build in, but tough for me to compare. I don't really have visibility into what others do.", "Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson.", "Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks. In terms of the platforms, Payment Solutions continues to somewhat grow a bit faster. Is that a function of folks looking for the deferred interest products, or is it more a function of just adding higher number of partners in that over the past year?", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I actually think it's a couple of things. We've had great success in winning more partners there for sure. The second is, we've put a fairly robust marketing strategy in place there to actually get brief (45:08) on the card. So if you went back four years or five years ago in that particular platform, we used to describe it as, you bought the product and you were done. We now, do fairly sophisticated marketing using our analytics to get customers to go back and repurchase, so that's another positive. I think, generally speaking, the other positive is, a lot of the products within Payment Solutions are related to home, and we definitely have seen that trend of home being positive where people are investing back in their homes. So I think, we've seen a positive momentum in that business, really for the last probably 12 months to 15 months, and it's just continuing.", "Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Thanks. And I guess, in terms of the \u2013 we're hearing from other issuers of the competitive environment, maybe more so related to the Retail Card side, seems to be increasing a bit over the past three months to six months, it's I guess, no big surprise, but I'm curious as to what you're saying from a competitive standpoint.", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think, it's been the same personally. I think, the players are the same players. You kind of get people come and go within that segment. I don't think it's hypercompetitive. I think, \u2013 listen, you need to ensure that you're building and investing in areas that are really going to help the partners. I think as you read, it's pretty 2% to 3% retail growth. So everyone is looking to try to get that customer back in there. We feel that, we have all the right aspects to compete effectively in the space. We're not going to win every deal, nor would we want to win every deal. So in the context of the overall market and what's available, we feel like we're winning the deals we want to win.", "Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to drill down a little more, Brian, as you commented on operating leverage in the business. I understand your guidance on the efficiency ratio for 2016. But just hoping if you can give us a little bit more to think about the kind of longer-term outlook for the efficiency ratio, and what kind of investments you need to make to continue to sustain growth from the business?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, I would say, generally the level of investment will be fairly consistent with what we've been doing in the past few years. Investing in long-term growth, I guess is not a new concept for us, we've been doing that for quite some time. I think that's why we have the growth rates that we do, and we continue to win and renew our partnerships. What I would tell you is, we're very focused on driving operating leverage, you saw that in the first half of this year. It's a scalable business. I mentioned the infrastructure cost and the run rate earlier. We'll continue to drive operating leverage. But as we get more efficient across the business, we're always running productivity initiatives, and we're looking at moving more customers off of paper statements to online statements. We're improving our call center and collections efficiency metrics. And so we're working on eliminating waste in the backoffice, things like that, and that results in real operating leverage and real productivity.", "And then in parallel with that, we look at things that we feel like we need to invest in to be very a successful business for the next 10 years to 15 years. And those are things that, some of the things that Margaret talked about, investing in mobile capabilities which is something we've been doing for four years or five years, data analytics, CRM, I mean, this is a rapidly changing industry, and we've got to stay on top of those things. But even after you take those incremental investments into account, we would expect to and we would hope to continue to generate positive operating leverage. That doesn't mean we're going to generate positive operating leverage every quarter. We're not going to pass up a good long-term strategic investment to show a few basis points improvement on the efficiency ratio in any one quarter, but over the long-term, this is a big focus for us and for the management team.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And just one clarifying question on the guidance itself. I think you indicated, remain below 34% on the back half. Are you talking about each quarter should remain below 34%, so the full year average probably remains below 33%, or you just saying, you're still sticking with the full year below 34%?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "We're sticking with the full year below 34%. Thanks for the clarification.", "Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered. But maybe just a follow up on credit, could you talk a little bit about the industry setting, and \u2013 because you've got more, I would say, more issuers also talking about the seasoning of their portfolios. Do you think that this kind of helps or hurts if others are in somewhat similar positions, and can you just talk about how that might affect yours and the industry going forward?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Well, hard for me to comment on what others are saying. I think the trends are \u2013 and the commentary seems to be fairly consistent, which is I think that the backdrop is still pretty healthy. I think the consumer is still generally healthy. The overall macro environment is pretty strong. With that said, the consumer continues to take on more debt. They continue to take on more leverage, and while it appears to be modest, and it looks like the overall levels are still pretty reasonable and pretty responsible. It's something we're watching carefully, I think others are watching it carefully as well. So our forecast includes that trend. It also includes the other factors that I mentioned, portfolio mix and mix by program and channel and other things. We believe this is going to result in a gradual increase and charge-offs over time. Some of that is seasoning, but as I mentioned earlier, I think seasoning, while everybody has on a vintage similar seasoning patterns, depending on the growth rates and the consistency of the growth rates, you could end up with a very different result depending on the issuer. And so I think, while that is a factor we have certainly considered in our outlook, it gets place maybe less overall (51:50) for us as it does with some others.", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe just a little bit of, kind of an update in terms of some of the new potential activities on the CareCredit front.", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So CareCredit is a great platform. It's one that we want to grow. So in addition to always signing up and winning new partnerships, which is key, the second area that we're focused on is really the utility of the card. So we're continuing to look at ways, and actually that consumers will have that card are looking to use the card more. So things like our partnership with Rite Aid, and you'll see more of those types of partnerships come out. We have a 50%, we use on that product, which is very high. We're looking at some additional industries that we might want to expand in, as well as, our biggest opportunity really in CareCredit is just getting more of what's in a partner's office. So if you think of dental as an example, it's getting more of those patients who come in to utilize the payment methodology of CareCredit. So we're working on some initiatives around that to really \u2013 similar to retail, increase our penetration in the office, of the card. So lots of activity going on there, lots of great marketing. We feel very positive about that business, and it might be a little kudos (53:24), but it's a growing kudos (53:25).", "Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "And thank you. And our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I had a follow up to really those questions on the pipeline in ROA. Margaret, as we think about the verticals you are targeting, and specifically T&E has been mentioned the last couple of quarters as a priority, you just signed up Cathay. More holistically, as we think about the T&E vertical, airlines, hotels and the like, and other verticals that are in your target area, is the profile or the mix of Dual Card in in-store going to materially change over the next few years? Should we be thinking about the profile changing, particularly as the T&E sector seems to be obviously, almost exclusively (54:33)?", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, we look at \u2013 no, I would say, no. Dual Card is still a very important aspect of our business. We'll, I think generally speaking in our overall portfolio, we always prefer if we can have a private label card and a Dual Card in our retail segment, because it allows us to really grow that portfolio. In terms of the co-brand aspect of our business, we're really trying to take some of the learning set of our retail Dual Card space and leverage that across some of these opportunities on T&E side, and driving value props, and even how you sign up and using mobile and digital as a way to really advance there. As Brian said, we're not looking to be the next big co-brand company, that's not our strategy, but we think opportunistically in a way for us to grow the business is really to look for these other opportunities, and take our capabilities that we have, and leveraging those in some of these new markets.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly, just one more follow up on credit. In the broader topic of curing later stage delinquencies, which was highlighted last month. Has there been any \u2013 is there any either internal change or external regulatory changes regarding call center activity, how active your delinquency management is, and anything on the collection front? And then in addition, can you provide some color whether historically you've sold many charge-offs, and how that mix plays into the recovery factor?", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah, sure. So on the first one, I would say, generally we're always making improvements and refinements to our collection strategies. We're fully compliant with the applicable regulatory guidance, whether it's TCPA or whatever it is, and obviously those have some impact on our ability to collect. But I would not highlight them as being overly significant in terms of the overall results. There are things that we adapt to along with the rest of the industry and we make other improvements to work offset to those. In terms of recoveries, I would just reiterate what I said earlier, the overall recovery rate, which includes a combination of what we collect in-house as well as what we sell, it has been pretty consistent. If you look over the past two years, it's been right around 1.1% to 1.2% of average receivables. It's little bit higher this quarter. We think it comes back down into that kind of two-year average going forward.", "David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC", "Got it. Thank you.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah.", "Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Hey Vanessa, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our last question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. I guess, I have a follow-up question on credit. It sounds now like you guys are talking about more normalization of losses versus some kind of specific stress as it might have sounded like at a recent conference. So maybe you could just talk about how you delineate the line between stress versus normalization. I think that would be really helpful.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So in June our comments indicated that we were expecting to see this modest increase in net charge-offs over the next 12 months. To us that's normalization. I think, others may have viewed it differently. And as part of that dialogue, we focus more specifically around the payment behaviors that were driving the reserve builds specifically in the quarter, that was the guidance we were providing. Now, I think we're trying to give you some broader context on items in the forecast that obviously influence the forecast, and items that drive some of that payment behavior that we're seeing, that the forecast includes things like portfolio mix by platform, by product, program channel. Well, seasoning is not as big for us, as I mentioned, as I think it may be for some others, that's included in our outlook as well, and we're also factoring the trends that we are seeing on the consumer.", "And I would just reiterate what I said earlier, that the consumer broadly is still generally healthy. We said all last year that we didn't think the consumer would get better, and they continued to get better all last year, and now we're seeing those improvements subside. But the overall macro-environment is still pretty strong. The thing that we're watching is the thing that I mentioned earlier, that the consumer continues to take on more leverage. It appears to be responsible at this point. The overall levels are reasonable if you look at, I mean, historic context. But it's something that we're watching carefully. And as we mentioned, we're watching what's going on in other asset classes as well, and looking at the layered risks. So our forecast includes that trend continuing, as well as the items I mentioned earlier.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. My follow up Margaret is just on the pipeline. I know you were asked the question, you characterized it as robust. But maybe you could just talk about the probability of something large happening over the near term. I mean, do you feel like that's the possibility?", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We'd love to have a big win. As I said earlier, we're going to continue to be disciplined and ensure that whatever we do win is a positive for the overall portfolio. We're competing on our capabilities, and we think in that particular area we're very strong, and we'll play out the opportunities that are out there.", "Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer", "Thanks, Sanjay.", "Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations", "Hey, thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial.

Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.", "I'll begin on Slide 3, third quarter net earnings totaled 604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter.", "We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued far outpace U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel.", "Looking at asset quality metrics, 30-plus days delinquencies were 4.26%, compared to 4.02% last year and our net charge off rate was 4.38%, compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses which increased only 2% over the last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year.", "Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased 9 billion or 23% to 50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service, as well as the build out of our product suite.", "Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling 16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling 238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth.", "Organic growth is more significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX companies, our strong performing program and great partnership. Card holders can continue to access loyalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online.", "We also extended our 17 year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, card holders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg card in their 220 stores.", "And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America\u2019s largest buying and marketing organization. They work besides thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business and we\u2019re happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group.", "We\u2019re also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform.", "We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new cobranded consumer credit program. The program will be offered to Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit card holders with office rewards and exclusive benefits.", "In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big box specialty retailer of home d\u00e9cor products, to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home card holders will be able to take advantage of commercial and financing office on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits including mobile account servicing.", "We launched a new program with The Container Store, The Container Store private label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions.", "We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google\u2019s release of their new Pixel phone. We\u2019re partnered with Google to launch Google Store financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wi-Fi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partnering program.", "We remain focused on pursuing new profitable opportunities to grow our business. Although, organic growth remains our biggest opportunity and as such we\u2019re working closely with our partners to continue to deliver leading edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth.", "Moving to Slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter, loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees and on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter we continue to drive growth by delivering value to partners and card holders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers.", "On the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to generate strong growth across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5.", "Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad based growth across retail car partner programs continued in the third quarter.", "As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed two new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long tenure relationships are an important part of our story. We\u2019re able to leverage the expertise we\u2019ve developed over the decades of running this business into a platform that attracts new important partners such as Nissan and Google.", "Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way.", "We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp, USA to continue providing consumer financing for power sports products distributed by KMC to a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. VP usage continues to be strong across payment solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter.", "CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties.", "In addition to the renewal of the key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with four prominent dental organizations. Extending the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive the reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter.", "We\u2019re also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the Healthcare provider practice, get a credit decision while they\u2019re there and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11%, and interest and fees on loans up 12%.", "Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our card, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend, with growth and average balance per active account up 4%, compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over the last year.", "The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and the net charge-off rate was 4.38%, compared to 4.02% last year.", "Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82%, compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics which I\u2019ll cover in more detail later reflects a gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. RSAs were up 34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter, compared to 4.6% last year.", "The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailers sharing and the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvements on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio.", "We expect the RSA percentage on a full-year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was at 19 million, driven by continued growth and auto store spending on our dual card, this was offset by a loyalty expense that increased by 23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a remainder the interchange and loyalty expense went back to the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items.", "Other expenses increased 16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%.", "I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over the last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are few dynamics worth pointing out.", "First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We\u2019re also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year.", "We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited to a degree from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth and lower yield in Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15%, compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year.", "The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased 9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding such as wholesale funding and we're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year.", "As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range, due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.", "Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall the credit environment remains favorable and we continue to see significant growth opportunities and attractive risk adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past three years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually overtime.", "Our view takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past three years.", "The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectation. The reserved bill reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization in net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third party collectors.", "Part of the increasing credit cost is offset through our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter, compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. Looking to the fourth quarter we typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables.", "However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past three years. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We\u2019ll provide a full year view on 2017 and conjunction with the outlook we\u2019ll provide in January.", "So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk adjusted returns for earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive.", "Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at 859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over the last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up 43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business.", "This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. Professional fees were up 12 million; this is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services.", "Marketing and business development costs were down 23 million, higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform.", "Information processing was up 10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expenses down 26 million due to reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE, as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form lower fraud expense.", "The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015.", "We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume related expenses during the holiday season, as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January.", "Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plan. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.", "Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth.", "Overall we\u2019re pleased with our ability to attract and retain our depositing customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in three-year fixed rate notes, this is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding.", "Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in August we did issue a total of $750 million in senior unsecured debt, 500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and 200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.", "Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules, and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year.", "Total liquidity increased to 24 billion, and includes 16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional 7.1 billion in undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.", "During the quarter we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock out of 952 million our board authorized for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions in acquired approvals.", "Overall we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital for growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Brian. I'll close with the summary of the quarter on Slide 11, and then we can begin the Q&A portion of the call. We delivered another quarter of strong operational performance across key areas of our business. We drove strong organic growth and renewed several key partnerships and signed and launched important new partnerships during the quarter and looking ahead, our pipeline remains strong. Supporting our growth is our fast growing online bank, which delivered another quarter of strong deposit generation, further strengthening our overall funding profile. Our capital and liquidity position also remained strong and we were pleased to commence the payment of a dividend and also repurchase shares during the quarter.", "I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call.", "Operator, please start the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great thanks. Brian, your comments about the net interest margin kind of coming back into that level, I guess what struck by is it felt like the seasonal improvement was a little better than - both in yields and the margin a little better than normal. Anything - you mentioned the revolve rate, so does some of that stick as we go forward, I mean how should we think about that over the fourth quarter and into \u201817?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, I think most of you think about the fourth quarter typically receivable yields come down just for seasonality. So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you\u2019re building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don\u2019t generate finance for deal in the quarter. So it is really that seasonal trend that is driving the forecast in the fourth quarter, the other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally we have been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range after we saw the strong deposit growth that obviously is continuing and then we are able to improve the yield on liquidity portfolio and also really optimizing amount of liquidity that we are holding. So all those things all else being equal should continue to flow through and we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter, that's why we kind of guided to the - took the guidance up to 15.75% for the year to 15.90% in the fourth quarter which should put you around somewhere around 15.90% for the year. So overall I think we performed very well on our margins relative to what we thought back in January.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Perfect that sounds great and just as a follow up, similarly just on the operating expenses I mean you had some extra expenses now with FDIC and yet your efficiency ratios still coming in better. It feels like that should continue unless there is other stuff that you would want to call out as we go over the next couple of quarters.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, we have been very pleased as well with the efficiency ratio all year really and we are 31% year-to-date, so we are well below the 34% that we indicated back in January. You we are obviously benefitting having very strong revenue growth of 12% year-to-date on the prior year. As you might expect and as we talked about in the past the efficiency ratio will come up in the fourth quarter. And we always spend more in marketing around holiday; we also tend to have more volume related expenses. But due to the strong start of the year in the fourth quarter trend even as we see it, we expect the efficiency ratio will be somewhere around 32% for the full year or so. Significantly better than what we thought back in January.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great, thanks very much.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just hit on the yield again Brian if you don\u2019t mind. I think Moshe mentioned the year-over-year increase in the yield was better for teams even it is for being on seasonality there is some other component to it. Is it late fees maybe and should we expect that to continue as the delinquency rates remain relatively elevated?", "Brian Doubles", "Well I think you always get a little bit more in a revolve in the book when you see a slight uptick in delinquencies, we are seeing that receivable yields were up 13 basis points year over year or so. This is really the first quarter where we have seen that kind of revolve rate and the benefits from the revolve rates poke through the downward pressure we had, just given the really strong growth and payment solutions. So that\u2019s the trend we are talking about all year, payment solutions is growing faster than the rest of the portfolio, roughly 15% growth rates relative to 9 to 10 in care credit and retail card and that was pricing downward pressure on the margins but now we are seeing that high revolve rate kind of poke through and gave us about 13 basis point yield improvement year-over-year.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "And is there anything more that can happen with the liquidity portfolio because I mean it seems like you can still optimize some on the yield side going forward?", "Brian Doubles", "There is probably a little bit there Sanjay, it is not going to be dramatic, I think we have got really nice job this year, using the excess liquidity from the strong deposit growth to pay down the bank term loan I think we feel good about what we have done year-to-date, we get more yield on the cash and securities that we are holding, but I would say anything additional is going to be pretty modest going forward.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you. Good morning. I do have a question on slide 8, specifically the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period and receivables and so clearly the very strong loan growth that we have been seeing has been driving reserve building but in addition to that growth driven building we have had kind of the normalization affect also driving building and so we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance gradually rising to kind of 5.8. That credit normalization effect has also driven some building and so it is kind of as we extend the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarter for modeling purposes, is that kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move into kind of like a six handle and [ph] gradually as we get over the next several quarters until 2017 that that number continues to rise or does that kind of flatten out at some point that where normalization is kind of achieved just trying to get substrate to think about that.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, sure Bill. Let me just kind of break down the reserve billed in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember we gave in a range of 5.7 to 5.8 in last quarter, we had a rate of 5.7% and this quarter we came in at 5.82%, so better than expected growth over big chunk of that reserve built in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days we had 2.4 billion receivable. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about 36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis point of coverage. So if you adjust for that the coverage would have been around 5.77%. So right middle of that range that we provided and if you think about it is helpful just to breakdown the reserve build in the quarter a little bit and this is not just to be cleared, this is not how we calculate the reserve but it gives you way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that 2.4 billion on receivables growth in the quarter and you just take that at the old coverage rate of 5.7% that gives you built of about 135 million of the 221. Right and then you got the coverage rate increased by 12 basis points which is about 86 million. And if you break that down into two pieces you got the 36 million for the recovery pricing that I have mentioned and then you got about 50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we are seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces on the way to think about it going forward.", "Bill Carcache", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful, thank you. And then as a follow up I was hoping you could share your thoughts on I guess what - maybe just broadly speaking has been some very favorable commentary from a capital perspective on given the Feds decision to eliminate qualitative failures for financials that are not considered GSIFs [ph] and also other changes including RWA growth partial by that termination during, it is really abrasive scenario, that it would seem to certainly significant source of potential upside for any non-GSIFs with significant excess capital and including yourselves just hoping that maybe you could share a little bit on how you guys are thinking about that?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, sure Bill. First just a quick reminder of that again we are not fee card bank but obviously we are trying to follow very similar rule that are in place for financial institutions of our sides. Given that new proposals that are out there I think clearly positive development, I think the moment to put in place more reasonable expectations for banks of our size. So we are obviously pleased to see that. I think it is still early to tell how significant the impact maybe, most of the more meaningful proposals I think will be adopted after the 2017 cycle so I have to see kind of what gets finalized but clearly the removable, the qualitative test for smaller financial institutions I think that\u2019s helpful. The treatment of dividends clearly the RWA assumptions those are all helpful but it is really hard to assess an impact until some of these things get finalized but I think it directionally headed the right way for us.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi good morning.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning.", "Betsy Graseck", "Just two questions one on the recoveries, I just want to make sure I understand what is driving the decision to resource around that and then secondly just had a question you did a analytics activity how much do you feel like you need to invest from here, how much have you invested so far and how much you think you need to invest from here to really get to where you want to be on data analytics and talk a little bit about the revenues that you can generate of the back of it thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Sure Betsy may I just cover the coverage quickly and then Margaret will do the data analytic. So the recovery assumptions as I just mentioned that were drove about $36 million of the reserve built which is about 5 coverage so in August we saw decline in the pricing we are getting on our recovery so obviously we built that in an assumption in the reserve model and we believe that pricing reflects some impact that is new regulation that are being proposed for third party collectors. The proposal will likely make it a little more difficult, little more expensive to collect and we believe that is influencing the pricing in the market. So as those rules get finalizing, collectors get a better sense of the impact here we may see additional impact on the pricing but as it is right now we put out best estimates based on what we are seeing in the market today.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay thanks.", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah so on data analytics I take two things, one as we continue to work with more channels we know that we have to really get more sophisticated and real time in our analytics. We don\u2019t really disclose how much we stand but what I can tell you as we are working very hard this year to build out a service sophisticated platform where we are really looking at building out data and CRM capability that goes well beyond just data for growing but also from a productivity perspective and really enhancing the whole win to win experience from our customer from the time they apply for credit all the way through to servicing and we have a pretty big cross functional team working on number of initiatives around data analytics. I believe and I think as our partners continue to look at ways to create more loyalty with our customers this is going to be in an important element of what we can bring to our partners combining that with the digital experience that are customers or starting to go through in really that area is growing exponentially. So it is an important area, with mobile and data analytics together I think these are two big growth levers for us as we look to really help our partners grow with our customer.", "Betsy Graseck", "And it is growth in the form of productivity enhancement for you but also winning new business?", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah, it\u2019s both. It is really using data just the much more smarter at how you are running the entire business from your origination all the way through to servicing and really looking at ways to make that customer experience even more seamless and frictionless using data and then hopefully using the data in a way that allows us to get the next purchase to get a bigger basket to drive that loyalty back in and enhance the experience with our retailers as they go from channel to channel.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay, awesome thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "May be I will start with the RSA loans I think I am sure they came in better and Brian reiterate the guidance of 420 to 430, just what I am looking clearly we are down call it four to twelve year to date and we are down at least 25 bps each quarter so just want to understand if we would end up on the low end of the range you would imply flat year-over-year relative to last year so I just wanted to say what is the specific fourth quarter this year given the factor we reserve built in, in your comments you said that we shouldn\u2019t expect the same seasonal decline I am just trying to understand the puts and takes of how we would get either not only in the range but also just to the bottom of the range on RSA?", "Brian Doubles", "Sure Ryan, I think the one thing that get missed when model RSA, one I think obviously seasonality piece of that but I also think that people tend to view it as an offset to credit in isolation and I think it is obviously includes much more than that and so if you look at your year-over-year I mean just talk about the quarter for the second we had obviously very growth, we had better margins fairly big improvement year-over-year, much better efficiency ratio and at least in terms of the margins and efficiency ratio we think that carries through to the fourth quarter but for the seasonal elements that I mentioned earlier and so all of those positive dynamics in the business push the RSA higher. Right and then those improvements in the quarter and our expectations going forward there is going to be an offset there for the incremental provision and so I think you got to carry some of the real positives through in the fourth quarter and then obviously those push the RSA higher offset by what we are expecting on provision.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it and maybe I feel in different direction that\u2019s okay maybe we could talk about loan growth it is obviously coming in I take much higher than your guidance from earlier in the year, can you just talk about how much is coming from new customers and how much is coming from increased penetration rates and maybe in retail card can you give us a sense of maybe where you are in penetration across the range of merchants and how much improvement in penetration you are making, where do you think you can get to over time?", "Brian Doubles", "Sure Ryan there is a lot in there so just remind me if I missed something but I think generally we have been very pleased with the growth that we had all year. We have got receivables growth of 11%, we guided early in the year to 7 to 9. So we are obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we have put out there in January. And when you look at the underlying growth drivers they are all pretty strong. You look at purchase volume per average active account was up, average balance per active account were up, we really measure as oppose to new accounts, what is really more important measure for us is active account. With private label and dual card you are really trying to move that more towards the top of all that card [ph] and get that usage and get that repeat purchases and so if you look at last two or three years and just compare that to average active account growth in last few quarters were up 7%. That growth has accelerated which is really positive dynamic for us, so I think there is really good evidence, good indicators of consumers are spending more, they are seeing real value in our card, the things we have done around the value propositions.", "In Amazon, in Wal-Mart, we just announced another one at Guitar Center, those are really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter that compares to about 15% for the industry, the reuse that we are getting in care credit was up year-over-year 52% versus 50% year ago and we are bringing on new partners. We are bringing on new partners I would say the majority of those are start-up programs; those aren\u2019t really influencing the growth that we had so far year to date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth, it is driving that increased penetration. That is something that obviously tracks by program, it is how we measure our teams, that\u2019s all we focus on that\u2019s the only way to really grow 11% in a retail environment that\u2019s growing 2% to 3% and that\u2019s been pretty consistent and our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past five years. So I think we feel really good about overall the fundamentals that we are seeing on growth. Did I miss any part of your question?", "Ryan Nash", "No, I think you answered almost thanks, thanks for taking my question.", "Brian Doubles", "Great thanks Ryan.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Thanks very much, I know there has been lot of discussion but I just want to go back to one item and maybe I didn\u2019t fully understand but as I look at the yield on cards had a I guess about 60 basis point delta sequentially and I am wondering if there is any pricing activity associated with that change.", "Brian Doubles", "No, we haven\u2019t really made any pricing changes, really as the factors that I indicated we got a little more revolved but if you go back and look at prior periods there is always the seasonal increase from the second quarter to the third quarter. it is maybe a little bit more outside this time but that\u2019s really the driver and then we are getting a slight impact from a slight benefit from the increase in the prime rates, you have seen a little bit of that in the quarter as well.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Got it, it was more than magnitude that was done, that I was curious about and then maybe just looking at purchase volumes, they did decline just a bit sequentially in retail and care credits, any trend to underscore there?", "Brian Doubles", "I don\u2019t think so, there is not always the perfect corollary between purchase volume and receivables you saw that as well in the first quarter when the purchase volume far outpace receivables. And I think as we indicated then this quarter we are comparing against the full quarter of BP and we are also comparing against the Amazon launch of 5% off so those are both factors when you look at purchase volume. I think more importantly receivables grow 11%, given what we are seeing in the mix or revolvers in the book which is great for us, that really drives the majority of our earnings and you are seeing that comparing interesting fees.", "Eric Wasserstrom", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.", "Mark DeVries", "Yeah. Thanks. Brian you just indicated you are seeing very good response particularly at Amazon and Wal-Mart, but something little bit more specific without identifying one in particular as to what kind of improvement you are seeing in tender share at this point from the enhanced rewards?", "Brian Doubles", "I obviously can't be specific on either program but I would say in both cases they are performing better than our expectations. And I would price modestly better than our expectations only because we really know how to model this, we did 5% off that loans [ph] I think more than five year ago. So we have got really good data in analytics around value propositions particularly really attractive ones like 5% off, 531 in cents [ph] and we know what to expect in terms of transactors, revolvers what we expect to see from tender shift what kind of spend we expect on the card, what kind of payment behaviors and so. We had a pretty good view on what we thought both of those would - how both of those would perform and I would say we are ahead of our expectations on both.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay great and for the online retailers that you have, how many of them have the option like they have got in Amazon where the private level card becomes top of wallet by default and for those that don\u2019t do that there is an opportunity to kind of move into that and really drives better tender share?", "Margaret Keane", "Yeah, that\u2019s definitely is, all of them have the option to do it even retails are not fully online. So to have that check out is really golden and it really comes down to kind of philosophy within the retailer in terms of someone have a choice and others it is just really around getting the prioritization of getting that particular element into their system to get in place. So it is something that we put together what we call our digital mobile, online playbook for retailers and this is something that we talk a lot about. So it is a big opportunity for us as we move forward and continue to work but I would say is on the mobile world in general and online world in general there is a lot higher engagement across all our partners right now in this particular area as they are all really coming to terms of the fact that they have to be best in class. So we are spending a tremendous amount of time and effort, really working with our partners across all three pipelines to really make that happen.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.", "David Scharf", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, wonder if I just get back to the recovery side as it is impacting the allowance forecast in collections. Can you expand a little more specifically on just how the proposed collection rates that are being revised, impact your efforts and whether that is likely to result based on new collection practices and to little more early stage in DQ that doesn\u2019t quite roll in or some of the change practices likely to impact more your latter stage caring efforts but just a little more specificity on its cost centre and other efforts just what has to be quantified?", "Brian Doubles", "Right now these are proposals and these proposals for new regulations around third party collectors. Obviously we sell a portion of our charge off to third parties and we believe that pricing that we are seeing in the market right now is somewhat influenced by these new proposal. So the proposal includes things like more documentation, more work for the third parties to substantiate the debt at the each stages for the collection process, reduce contact other restrictions things like that, additional disclosures and so, lot of these things aren't finalized at this point but I think people are anticipating that at a minimum it is going to be little more difficult, little more expensive based on these new proposals and they are building that into their pricing. So as we started to see that right around in the August time frame, we felt that in the reserve model and that is driving, what I would call relatively modest impact of five basis points on the coverage.", "David Scharf", "Got it and along those lines I know that the two largest debt buyers both public after a couple of years of commenting of elevated pricing and not much supply growth in the US, just a last couple of quarters seems to have been indicating that pricing has been leveling off and so forth. Are you finding that the pricing as a percentage of principal balance that you are able to sell charge offs for are declining or they pretty much holding firm with the historically more elevated prices that you saw earlier in the year.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, we did see a decline in the pricing and we think a part of that is driven by this dynamic that I just described on some of these anticipations of some of these new regulations that are coming in. We don\u2019t get obviously complete transparency at the end of the pricing. So this is what we believe at least partly influencing what we are seeing in the market.", "David Scharf", "Got it, very helpful, thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman", "Hi. Thanks, I had just two quick questions. Margaret, in the past year you had made some comments about the digital channels, I was wondering if you could help us to quantify those that are even quantitatively like how much is that driver of the growth of the company? And then Brian I was wondering if you could elaborate and you talk about this a bit, but the loyalty payment at 145 million if you look at the new absolute [ph] it is the higher that we have seen and then as a percentage of the purchase volume it was also high so anything that you could share on the trajectory that would be helpful, so one on digital and two on loyalty. Thank you.", "Margaret Keane", "I would say the bulk of sales are still done predominantly in store, but what I would say is that it is definitively shifting and each quarter we see incremental growth on online and digital and as we stated our online sales were up 26% over last year and that continues to grow every single quarter. About a third of our applications occur digitally. We received about 12 million mobile applications since we launched in 2012, that\u2019s grown at about 80% year-over-year so that\u2019s a big growth channel for us that I think you would continue to see expanding. And we are seeing faster growth in the industry so I think the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners and so one of the things we are really working hard on now obviously we have done [indiscernible] those things we have digital cards on our own. What we are seeing now is more and more retailers are creating their own apps and we are really trying to work to be in that app so that is really seamless and frictionless process for the customers they are shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you are going to see as focusing even more on that retailers come to us and ask to really engage at a much higher level, that\u2019s my point earlier, I think this isn\u2019t a little bit of a shift in terms of how retailers are even thinking about mobiles and putting a lot more efforts there, that\u2019s why we are very highly engaged right now across all three platforms really.", "James Friedman", "Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "And then on your loyalty question, that\u2019s a trend that we have continued to see all year. We have obviously introduced many new value propositions over the past year. We introduced the Sam's Club 5-3-1, Amazon Prime 5%, we have got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proportion at Wal-Mart that three two one, so all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines as you see. Generally more loyalties is a good thing, it means we have grown our receivables; we are generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSAs there is an offset there and if you are looking at just a relationship between royalty and interchange the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than purpose card, given we have significant value propositions like Amazon where we don\u2019t charge interchange but we still offer very attractive value proposition. We would expect to see loyalty increase a percentage of interchange going forward. That\u2019s really we don\u2019t look at those lines and isolation we really measure on kind of in the context of the overall deal structure. So it is like if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition and it is going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth that\u2019s a good thing for us, it is a good think for our partners and it really comes down to the shared economic model.", "James Friedman", "Thanks for taking my questions.", "Brian Doubles", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson.", "Arren Cyganovich", "Thanks. With respect to the efficiency improvements that you have seen, maybe you could talk a little bit about the potential for that to continue to go down or you use some of the savings to reinvest in digital and maybe online checking those kinds of things working that operating efficiency actually go to over time.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, this has been a very strong year to date performance I mean it is not just a temper expectation, probably not a realistic expectation that we are in a grow revenue in 12% and expense too. So we are very pleased with how we performed year to date. Well obviously we have been given an outlook for 2017, we do the call in January, but I think the important thing is we are very focused on driving operating leverage. This is a scalable business, now that the infrastructure cost are in the run rate, we would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long run. We are always working to get more efficient across the business, we always start the year with a bunch of productivity initiatives, cutting out waste in the business, getting more efficient, moving more online off the paper and we use those savings that we generate there primarily to invest in long terms growth ideas, so things like mobile, data analytics, CRM, but even taking those investments into account, we\u2019d still - our goal would be to continue to generate operating leverage going forward.", "Arren Cyganovich", "Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just back to the allowance, you\u2019d mentioned that the seasonality that you typically see in the fourth quarter causes the allowance for loan losses to relative receivables to fall a little bit. It looks like it\u2019s been around 18 and 19 basis points in recent years. Can you give a little bit further kind of pinpoint in terms of how much that reduction will be less during the fourth quarter this year?", "Brian Doubles", "I mean it\u2019s hard to get specific, it will be - we still expect a reduction, so more than zero, but less than 19. And we\u2019re talking about basis points, so it\u2019s a big estimate that we make at the end of the year given the seasonal growth. So I can\u2019t get more specific. We do expect it to come down, but just not quite as much as it has in the last three years. You have to remember, in the last three years, we were in an improving environment, so whatever build we\u2019re recording in the fourth quarter was at least partially offset by improved performance and now it\u2019ll be more reflective of growth and the normalization trends that we\u2019re seeing in the portfolio.", "Arren Cyganovich", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Greg Ketron", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Well, thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies", "John Hecht", "Thanks very much guys. Margaret, you\u2019ve given a lot of information about the online, the trends of the business, I\u2019m wondering if you could just - if you get down to the customer level, can you guys highlight any - whether it\u2019s spend trends, borrow trends or credit trends, is there any difference between an online customer and a store based customer?", "Margaret Keane", "No, the online spend and the trends are the same. I\u2019d say, the one area that we continue to ensure we\u2019re focused on is really ensuring the authentication of the customer. So I think that\u2019s where pro-rates might be slightly lower just because you\u2019re dealing with an online channel versus an in-store experience. But that\u2019s a great area where we\u2019re spending a lot of time and investing in new technology to really make sure we\u2019re best in class. So that would be the only I think fundamental difference.", "John Hecht", "Okay, that\u2019s good color, thanks. And then last question, I\u2019m wondering if you could just remind us of your partner maturity profile as we go into 2017?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, I think we\u2019ll have that in our investor deck that will come out in a few days. But there\u2019s really - you\u2019ll see from that there\u2019s really nothing material contractually kind of the 2019, 2020 timeframe.", "John Hecht", "Great, thanks guys.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, thank you.", "Greg Ketron", "Hey, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day.", "Operator", "And thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "And I will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.", "Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results and a 2017 outlook.", "I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $576 million or $0.70 per diluted share. We draw significant broad-based growth in each of our sales platforms, which resulted in double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income for the company. We also grew purchase volume 9% over the fourth quarter of last year.", "Looking at just our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 20%, far exceeding U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. And our Retail Card online sales penetration reached 25% in the fourth quarter.", "Looking at asset quality, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our strong revenue growth and expense discipline has yielded robust operating leverage, and put our efficiency ratio at 31.6% for the quarter, approximately 240 basis points lower than last year.", "Supporting our growth was another quarter of significant deposit generation, which increased $9 billion, or 20%, to $52 billion. Deposits now comprise 72% of our funding source. By focusing on competitive rates and exceptional customer service, we plan to continue to drive deposit growth. The longer term we expect for that growth to trend more in line with our receivables growth.", "Our balance sheet remain strong with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.2% and liquid assets totaling $14 billion, or 15% of total assets at quarter end. And we were pleased to pay our quarterly common stock dividend payments of $0.13 and repurchased $238 million of our common stock during the quarter. This augments the capital we are deploying through our strong balance sheet growth.", "And the biggest driver of that growth continues to be organic growth. At the same time, we are pursuing new partnerships and we are pleased to have launched our new Fareportal program during the fourth quarter. The program includes the Dual Card and private label products for their brands. This is the first credit card program from an online travel agency to include a special financing offer to help manage the cost of travel and also includes an enhanced loyalty program.", "In addition, CareCredit announced a new multi-year agreement with Henry Schein Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Henry Schein, Inc., the world\u2019s largest provider of healthcare products and services, to office-based dental, animal health, and medical practitioners. This strategic alliance will include the integration of CareCredit financing into Henry Schein\u2019s leading practice management software solutions, co-marketing programs and collaboration on prospective value-added services.", "We are continuously working on the development of solutions to improve functionality, and ease of use for mobile, an increasingly important sales channel. For example, this quarter we launched SyPi, a of fully integrated Synchrony plug-in credit feature for our retailers\u2019 app, which we developed with GPShopper.", "The plug-in allows credit card holders to easily shop, redeem rewards, and securely manage and make payments on their accounts via their mobile device. Cardholders can view account balances and purchase activity, make payments, and check available credit limits for quick-and-easy purchasing decision, all within the retail\u2019s app. It can be quickly integrated and is fully customizable for the retailer, and easily integrated into their existing app enhancing the mobile shopping experience, increasing customer engagement and boosting loyalty.", "We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter we introduced Pay My Provider, a secure online payment portal that allows cardholders to pay their outstanding balances with their CareCredit card anytime, anywhere and on any device.", "It provides cardholders a convenient and secure payment option. Patients can choose from the available financing options and submit a payment directly to the provider using their CareCredit card. We continue to drive strong results this quarter, developing, extending and deepening relationships to drive value for our partners, cardholders and shareholders.", "Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remains strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans also grew 12% over the fourth quarter of last year. We are delivering value to partners and cardholders through attractive value proposition, promotional financing and strategic marketing offers and this is helping to drive strong results.", "On the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to generate strong growth across all three of our sales platforms as shown in Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter a strong performance. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%.", "Interest and fees on loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner program continued in the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we have leveraged our expertise to attract new partners in the travel and entertainment space. And we have won several new partners in this segment in 2016. During the fourth quarter we launched an exciting new program with Fareportal.", "We look forward to deepening these relationships and continuing to attract new partners as we build our business in this attractive segment. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 13% and, average active account growth of 12%. Interest and fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables with home furnishing, automotive products and power leading the way.", "During the quarter, we announced a new partnership with CFMOTO, to be the exclusive provider of consumer financing for products sold in the U.S. and VP usage continue to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 28% of purchase volume in the fourth quarter.", "CareCredit delivered another strong quarter as well. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth.", "Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. And we are pleased to have announced the new multi-year agreement with Henry Schein Financial Services, LLC, expanding the network in utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive our reuse rate of 53% of purchase volume in the quarter.", "2016 was a year of significant progress. We generated strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms driving solid revenue growth, substantial operating leverage and attractive returns. In addition, we signed several key relationships and expanded our network and card utility, while continuing to innovate valuable digital solutions and expand our analytics capabilities to bring value to our partners and customers.", "Our direct deposit platform has continued to support our growth, as we have successfully extended this lower-cost funding source. All of this success has contributed to our ability to return capital to shareholders, not only through robust growth, but now also via payment of dividends and through our share repurchase program.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter, the business earned $576 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter.", "We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 9% and, both receivables and interest in fees on loans up 12%. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2016. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers.", "The positive trends continued in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 5% compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 3% over the last year.", "The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $253 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year. And the net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% last year. The full-year net charge-off rate was 4.5% in line with the outlook of 4.3% to 4.5% we provided at the beginning of 2016.", "Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.69%. Reserves were in line with the view we provided last quarter. Coverage typically declines in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal build in receivables and coverage came down 13 basis points compared to the third quarter as we expected.", "The asset quality metrics, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail later, are in line with our expectations and reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we highlighted this year. RSAs were up $77 million compared to last year, RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.4% for the quarter, compared to 4.5% last year. The slightly lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which offsets the increase in sharing from the year-over-year revenue growth and lower expense growth.", "On a full-year basis, the RSA percentage was 4.2%, which was in line with the 4.2% to 4.3% range we had expected. The reserve build in the second quarter of 2016 resulted in the RSA running at a lower level than previous years. Looking forward into 2017, we think the RSAs will move back closer to the 4.4% to 4.5% range, near the levels we had been running at prior to 2016.", "Other income was essentially flat versus last year. While interchange was up $20 million, driven by continued growth in auto store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by a loyalty expense that increased by $32 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a remainder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items.", "Higher debt cancellation fees and other income offset the impact of higher loyalty expense net of interchange. Other expenses increased $48 million or 6% versus last year, driven by growth and bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities.", "The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.6%, significantly lower than last year due to the strong operating leverage we have generated this year. I\u2019ll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter with strong revenue and net earnings growth compared to prior year.", "I\u2019ll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 13%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.22% for the quarter, up 49 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out.", "First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in earlier in 2016. We\u2019re also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables increased 17 basis points to 21.36%, driven by slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year.", "We also realized a modest benefit from the increase in the primary compared to the prior year. Lastly, funding costs improved by 2 basis points driven by improved funding mix. Our deposit base increased by $9 billion and was 72% of our funding sources versus 64% a year ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources. So the margin benefited from the shift in the funding mix to lower cost deposits.", "The improvements noted above were partially offset by the impact of mix-shift due to continued strong growth and lower yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The plat\u2019s receivables have grown on average 15% compared to retail card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 10% to 11% range over the past year.", "So overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our outlook for the year. Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk adjusted returns.", "However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past two years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors.", "In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.03% compared to 1.86% in the prior year.", "The net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% last year. And as I noted earlier, net charge-offs for the year were 4.5%, in line with our outlook for the year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables decreased 13 basis points from the third quarter, to 5.69%, due mainly to the seasonal build in receivables and was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio and the normalization in net charge-offs.", "In summary, while credit will normalize from here, it\u2019s important to reiterate that we\u2019re still operating in a pretty favorable environment. And the risk adjusted returns we\u2019re earning on the new accounts we\u2019re bringing on are still very attractive.", "Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $918 million for the quarter, up 6% over the last year driven primarily by growth.", "Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $30 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth in the business. This increase also reflects cost related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE.", "Marketing and business development costs were up slightly, $2 million over the last year. Increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which help drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables was largely offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions which is reflected in loyalty program expense.", "Information processing was up $5 million or 6% driven by continued IT investments, and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense increased $12 million, primarily driven by growth.", "The efficiency ratio was 31.6% for the quarter, approximately 240 basis points lower than last year, as the business continue to generate significant positive operating leverage due to the strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses.", "Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plans.", "Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.", "Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily to our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 72% of our funding, significantly higher than the 64% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities.", "Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our CDs in 2016 was 91%, which is up from 88% in the prior year.", "In terms of our funding plan going forward, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 17% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding.", "Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. While we did not do any issuance in the fourth quarter, we will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and expect this to be 10% to 15% of our funding going forward. So overall, we feel very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources.", "Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.2% CET1 under the transition rules and 17% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 15.9% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the past year.", "Total liquidity decreased slightly compared to the prior year to $20 billion, and includes $13.6 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional $6.7 billion in undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 22.5% of our total assets. This is down from 24.9% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity as I noted earlier. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.", "During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock out of 952 million our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to execute our share repurchase plan, subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.", "Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Next on Slide 11, I\u2019ll recap our 2016 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 12% exceeded our outlook range of 7% to 9%. The growth in 2016 was driven by the strong value props on our cards, and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth. Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth as well as win new programs.", "Net interest margin was 16% for the year, which is better than the 15.5% range we provided back in January. Higher receivables yield, and a more optimal asset and funding mix were the major drivers for the outperformance. Our net charge-off rate of 4.5% was in line with our outlook of 4.3% to 4.5%. We did start to see net charge-offs normalize off the very favorable levels in 2015, and expect this to continue into 2017, which I will discuss in our outlook.", "The efficiency ratio for the year was 31.1%, well below the 2015 level of 33.5% and our outlook of below 34%. Stronger revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses generated significant operating leverage in 2016. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.7%, which was at the mid-point of our range for 2016.", "The strong operating leverage we generated due to higher growth, improved net interest margin and expense control more than offset higher provision expense in 2016. So overall, we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2016.", "Moving to our 2017 outlook on Slide 12, our macro assumptions for 2017 assume the fed tightens 25 basis points late this year, and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate. Our outlook for receivables growth is in the 7% to 9%. We expect to continue to grow sales volume at two to three times broader retail sales. This outlook doesn\u2019t assume any significant new portfolio acquisitions or value propositions, and it\u2019s in line with our organic growth rates in the previous years.", "We believe our margin will be in the 15.75% to 16% this year. While we expect to realize a modest benefit from the December rate increase, we expect this to be more than offset by the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions. If rates do increase during the year, we expect our slightly asset-sensitive position will provide a small benefit to our net interest income.", "In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs to further normalize into the 4.75% to 5% range in 2017. Our base plan class for net charge-offs to be just under the midpoint of the range. We have also evaluated scenarios with changes to portfolio mix, consumer trends, payment behaviors and recovery rates. And if they were to trend somewhat differently than we have planned, this would bring net charge-offs closer to the higher end of the range.", "Regarding the loan loss reserve and coverage in 2017, we would expect the reserve to cover approximately 14 to 15 months of expected future net charge-offs, which should give you a way to think about the reserve builds throughout the year. We also need to consider how seasonality impacts reserve covers. For example, we typically see reserves as a percent of receivables increase 40 to 50 basis points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, given the seasonal decline in receivables and we would expect the similar trend this year.", "Moving to the efficiency ratio, for 2017 we expect to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of around 32%. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, partially driven by the timing of the spend on some of those projects.", "Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. And we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And finally, we continue to expect to generate return on assets in the 2.5%-plus range in 2017.", "Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2017. We are planning to follow a very similar process to 2016. We will use the fed scenarios and assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we\u2019ll review with our Board and our regulators in early April. And we hope to gain a position to announce our capital plans in the June-July timeframe.", "While I can\u2019t be specific as to our capital plans at this point. We would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks in addition to supporting growth.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll close with an overview of our strategic priorities. First, we will continue to execute across our three sales platforms. Building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and mobile technology, we expect to continue increase in penetration at existing partners and we\u2019ll add new partners and programs.", "Second, we will continue to expand our robust data, analytics and technology offerings, and will continue our innovative strategy on mobile wallet development for private-label credit cards.", "Third, we will broaden our banking product suite to help increase loyalty, further diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. We will also leverage our expertise to explore opportunities to expand our core business, such as expanding our small business capabilities and growing proprietary networks and acceptance.", "Fourth, we will continue to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets.", "Finally, we will continue to leverage our strong capital position. Our capital priorities are first and foremost organic growth and program acquisitions. Second, capital returns through dividends and share repurchases. And lastly, M&A that helps us enhance our capabilities to support growth.", "In closing, we accomplished a great deal this year and believe we are well positioned to continue to leverage our expertise, market position and innovative approach to digital platforms and analytics to grow our program, pursue opportunities and continue to deliver value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call.", "Operator, please start the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] and we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thanks and good morning. I guess the question I wanted to ask is around competition. Obviously, one of the key items that came out recently is the Chase\u2019s Amazon Card product, the enhancement they made for rewards. Could you just talk about what kind of implications you expect to have on your own growth for that product? And just in general, I guess, I was getting a lot of questions from people asking if this means that the outside banks that aren\u2019t in private-label are going to find their way into the space.", "Also, just maybe if you could clarify, the online sales growth number, Margaret, that you mentioned, it seemed to have slowed a little sequentially. Could you just talk about that as well? Thanks.", "Margaret Keane", "So there was lot of questions there. So let me start with Amazon and Chase. So, first of all, both of our programs have actually sat side-by-side for the last 9 years. We have the private label program and we have the opportunity to offer promotional financing. So these two programs have been out there together the whole time.", "It\u2019s not surprising that Amazon wanted to match the value props. We knew that that was going to happen. We still believe that, given the growth of Amazon and our partnership with Amazon, that we have plenty of room to continue to grow. We see this as still a very big opportunity for us, particularly because of our partnership with them and the fact that we do have the promotional financing for big ticket it actually gives us some other opportunity.", "In terms of how we\u2019re looking at it in our 2017, I\u2019d just turn it over to Brian to kind of maybe comment on that.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. I\u2019d just reiterate what Margaret said, I mean, the two products have coexisted for a long period of time. And for the most part the products appeal to different consumers. And so, we\u2019ve been able to grow the program very well over the years. That\u2019s still our expectation going forward. Anything that we expect to see there has been obviously included in the guidance, so we just gave it on receivables.", "Margaret Keane", "And then your question on kind of mobile and online, let me just give you a little flavor. So overall, you saw we continue to invest in digital. We rolled out SyPi in the fourth quarter, which we feel really good about. Our online sales were up 20% versus last year, which is still above the industry average, which is about 16%. I think one important metric is in our sales penetration for Retail Card. It totaled 20% of our sales, while the national average is about 8%. And we\u2019re now getting about 40% of our applications online.", "So if you think about where we\u2019re going and particularly where mobile is going. We also see big growth in mobile, in that over 50 million of our apps have [come overly] [ph] since 2012. And that\u2019s growing at above 42% year-over-year. So a little off of what we were running at, but certainly a very strong metric and one that we feel very good about. And see lots of opportunity in this space to continue to really outperform what the industry is performing at.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.", "Donald Fandetti", "Hi, good morning. Brian, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about any potential portfolio acquisitions. And also on the Cabela\u2019s deal Capital One ended up winning, it sounds like there is potentially some regulatory hurdles. They have to work through licenses. You guys were in there potentially as the cover bid. And I was just curious, if you think about a deal like that, I think one of the issues was that it was a bank.", "When you buy a retail portfolio, do you have any restrictions if there is a bank involved and like how quickly would you be able to get that type of approval? If you could just kind of talk about that a bit.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure, Don. So why don\u2019t I start with the pipeline. I mean, we continue to see a very strong pipeline across all three of our platforms. As you know, we don\u2019t build that into our guidance. So the outlook for 2017 of 7% to 9% on receivables is really organic growth. That\u2019s really continuing to take tender share, grow penetration side of the existing retailers.", "But we always hope to add programs throughout the year. We had a really strong year on new deals, new program wins. We feel very good about our competitive position in all three platforms. And so that expectation is that will continue through 2017. I think Cabela\u2019s, obviously - it\u2019s our practice not to comment on potential transactions. So there is really not a lot that I can add there unfortunately.", "Donald Fandetti", "Can you talk maybe a little bit about broadly when you look at a portfolio, if there is a bank, is that a consideration or is that a hurdle for you, I should say, even just generally?", "Brian Doubles", "Well, I think the - the consideration there is that if you\u2019re acquiring another charter it usually requires a more, I guess, regulatory approval or a non-objection potentially depending on what the charter is and who the acquiring bank is. And so I think that\u2019s certainly I think a consideration for anyone in the space as opposed to just if you\u2019re buying a portfolio without a charter.", "Again not commenting specifically on any particular transaction, but acquiring charter tends to create a little bit more of a regulatory hurdle.", "Donald Fandetti", "Got it. Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.", "Richard Shane", "Thanks, guys, for taking my question. When we think about the consumer\u2019s decision to use private-label versus general purpose, I think the decision is really driven by sort of balancing the utility of having available to borrow on a private-label that doesn\u2019t reduce general purpose of borrowing and the incentives of rewards. And what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is reward incentive has gone up a ton. Are you guys seeing any shift in terms of how consumers are using the private-label card? Is that value proposition between utility and incentive changing in any meaningful way?", "Margaret Keane", "Well, I would say that what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is, obviously, greater penetration in our partners on private-label. And a lot of that is driven by the value props that we put out, the 5% on Amazon, the Walmart value prop, those types of value props are important to the consumer. I mean, I think one thing that consumers continuing to look for is either some form of cash back or reward points that they can go in and spend more. Most of our private-label rewards are really around driving that customer back into our partners.", "So I would say that consumers are paying a lot more attention to the type of rewards they are getting. And they\u2019re really looking for some type of real financial benefit to really encourage them to spend more. And that something we continually research, we continually evaluate. We work with our partners to make sure we have fresh offers out there continually. And we continue to feel good about how we\u2019re positioned here and the work we do with our partners on the types of research we do in rolling out those types of programs.", "Richard Shane", "Well, it\u2019s interesting because if you think about the distortion we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s really between the consumer and the issuer. The retailers\u2019 incentive to drive transactions toward private-label because of the lower transaction fee has been unchanged.", "Margaret Keane", "True. I\u2019d also say from the retailer, because of our RSAs that\u2019s a very important element in addition to the overall getting customers to use. But I think the other piece that\u2019s important to note in all our research, we know that if a customers using a private-label credit card in one of our retailers, they tend to be the retailer\u2019s best customer. So those are the customers that are much more loyal and spending more within that retailer. So it really is not just about saving interchange or cost, it\u2019s really about growing sales for the retailer.", "And when a customer holds a private-label credit card, their basket tends to be bigger and they tend to make more trips to that particular retailer, whether it is in-store or online.", "Richard Shane", "Terrific. Thanks, and sorry for the cell-phone ringtone in the background. That was the old Hartford Whalers\u2019 theme song.", "Brian Doubles", "No problem, Rick.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht", "Thanks, guys. You commented a little bit on the efficiency ratio. And you mentioned, we should expect some operating leverage [with that] [ph] you\u2019re making certain investments in the platform. Maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on the types of investments and the timing. And then a little deeper in that is, what part of the expense structure in terms of line items, where we will see those inflections?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, sure, John. So I think maybe just to frame it up, we should take a walk back through 2016. And in the last quarter\u2019s call, I indicated that growing revenues 13%, expense is only growing 5%, and driving 240 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio wasn\u2019t exactly a reasonable expectation going forward. So I think there are a couple of things to think about in 2017. So first on the revenue side, our expectation is that revenue grows more closely in line with the three year average, so more in line with receivables growth than what we did in 2016.", "And then on 2016 in particular, we ended up spending a little less on the strategic investments than we originally planned. And so, that drove part of the efficiency ratio benefit that we had in 2016. And it really is just driven by timing of some of the spend related to the projects. And now some of that spend is going to slip into 2017. So that\u2019s really the timing difference that we are talking about.", "In terms of the areas that we are investing it\u2019s all the things that we talked about in the past. It\u2019s digital capabilities, mobile, online, analytics, and it\u2019s really investing in those things. It\u2019s helping us deliver this very strong growth in what is a relatively weak retail environment.", "So when we look at the plan for 2017, we\u2019re absolutely driving operating leverage in the core business. However, it is our expectation that it will be offset by the incremental spend on the strategic projects just giving the timing dynamic that I just mentioned. Does that make sense?", "John Hecht", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Yeah. And then with respect to the NIM guidance, maybe you could break it down, how much do you expect the kind of NIM trends to be related to the rate environment versus, I guess, the contract prices versus what you are doing with your excess liquidity portfolio?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, sure. So I\u2019d say generally most of the drivers on NIM should be fairly stable. There is always a few puts and takes. First, we are slightly asset sensitive, so we would expect to see a modest improvement from the rate hike that we just got in December, and the increase in prime. But then we expect to have a couple of offsets. Last year, particularly in the second half of 2016, we had a pretty significant lift in receivable yields. We saw higher revolve, frankly came in better than we expected it to. And we think that that benefit will moderate a bit into 2017.", "And then, one of the dynamics that we had all year-in 2016 was the really strong growth of Payment Solutions. We do expect that to continue. And the fact that those receivables come on at a lower yield than the portfolio average, that will give us some slight downward pressure on the margins.", "And the last thing I would just point out is that just given where the yield curve is right now, any unsecure or secured issuance we do in 2017 is likely to be a little more expensive. So I would say, generally fairly stable on the margins for 2017 with some slight downward bias.", "John Hecht", "I appreciate the color. Thanks very much.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.", "David Ho", "Good morning. I just wanted to parse out some of the credit outlook commentary you provided. Specifically starting out with the charge-off rate guidance, how does that compare to your June guide of roughly 20 to 30 basis points kind of through the first-half of 2017. And now we\u2019re kind of looking towards more of 25 to 50 basis points higher for all of 2017. Is that really the mix or do you see just a little bit on the margin, a little more credenalization [ph] on the back half of maybe higher or more aggressive kind of growth on the part of consumer? Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah, sure, so no real change from what we previously indicated. We expect to continue to see credit normalize over time. The backdrop is still favorable. We still feel good about where unemployment is, where jobs are, so the consumer is generally healthy. As I mentioned in the comments earlier, our base plan has this a little below the midpoint of the range. So that\u2019s right in line with kind of where we thought would be back in June for the full year 2017. We obviously look at other scenarios and other assumptions that could push us toward the higher end as well.", "We look at things like portfolio mix and expected mix changes. We look at consumer trends and payment behaviors. And that\u2019s what really gave us that range of 4.75% to 5%.", "We\u2019ve also assumed a relatively stable macro environment, so we didn\u2019t include any lift from job growth, wage growth. It\u2019s really based on more of a status quo economy. So I think importantly, look, overall we are still very comfortable operating at these levels. And we really like the risk adjusted returns on the accounts we\u2019re booking.", "David Ho", "Sure. And then, more specifically on the mix, are you still seeing some faster growth from stores with a slightly weaker customer mix? And maybe how much of that is being offset by kind of lower loss rate Dual Card growth?", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. I mean, those are all included in the guidance obviously. As we talked about in the past, our underwriting is very customized and we underwrite differently based on platform, by program, but also by channel and by product. So for us is not a one size fits all approach. So you can maintain very consistent credit guidelines, which we have. But given that we underwrite to different loss rates across all those different dynamics, portfolio mix can play a factor. And we certainly included that in the guidance that we provided.", "David Ho", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Hi, good morning.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Could we talk a little bit about the Dual Card program and the expectations you have for expanding that? And how much of that is in the guidance that you provided in loan growth?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. So we\u2019re always looking to expand Dual Card. It\u2019s been a great product for us in terms of where we are. We try to get it into all big programs. So we continue to look at ways to encourage our partners to deliver Dual Card. And, 19 of our 26 customers already - or partners already have a Dual Card. So it\u2019s definitely part of our strategy. It\u2019s definitely something we feel really good about. And we\u2019ll continue to work with our partners to grow those programs.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Okay. And then, separately\u2026", "Brian Doubles", "And then, talking specifically on your guidance question, we obviously build in the current trends that we\u2019re seeing on growth related to Dual Card. What we don\u2019t build in though typically are new Dual Card launches. So as Margaret said, we have Dual Card in 19 of the 26 programs. For the other seven we haven\u2019t assumed that we do any big Dual Card launches there. So that would be incremental if we\u2019re able to get one or two of those done this year.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Okay, got it. And then a follow-up question on just the outlook for tax reduction and how you would use that strategically in your business, you\u2019re obviously a [full freight payer] [ph] right now. And if there were to be any tax changes that would reduce that for you, how would you think about that in your competitive position?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, now, it\u2019s a great question. Obviously, there are a lot of speculation going on right now. Typically, we don\u2019t spend money that we don\u2019t have. So I think we need to wait and see to see what kind of benefit we do realize on tax reform. Right now, we\u2019re funding the majority of the strategic projects that we\u2019ve identified. But obviously, we would take a look at that and see if there is maybe some more that we could do on that front to drive growth. I think, it would be the same things that we\u2019re investing in now. But maybe it just is we do a little bit more that.", "We might invest a little bit more in promotions, value propositions. All things are going to continue to drive growth to make the business better. The key question I think is how does the competitive environment change under tax reform and we\u2019ll obviously have to react to that as well.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "And do your clients expect to get any of that tax improvement that you would generate for themselves? Would that be part of the discussion you think?", "Brian Doubles", "Well, I think that\u2019s going to be part of the discussion on all of this. Like I said, I think we\u2019re going to have to see how the competition reacts to this. And, I think to the extent that there is real savings here, we\u2019re going to have to react to the competitive reality of that. But I think that\u2019s we\u2019re really speculating now. I think first we have to see what tax reform looks like and then I think we have to see what competitors end up doing.", "Betsy Lynn Graseck", "Okay. Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.", "Mark DeVries", "Yes, thanks. So it looks like the loan growth guidance for 2017, again, it was biased to be conservative than last year. You guys came in 300 basis points above the high-end of your guidance. I guess my question is what kind of headwinds do you see the loan growth that would justify kind of a midpoint that\u2019s again kind of 400 basis points below your run rate for 2016.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure, Mark. So, look, obviously 2016 was a very strong year. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing across the portfolio. I think the headline growth numbers were good. When you break down and look at the customer level metrics, you see really good trends on purchase volume per active account was up 3%, the balances per account were up 5%. So these are all good indicators that the consumers are seeing real value on the cards. So I think generally we feel really good about how we\u2019re positioned here.", "When we build the outlook for 2017, you have to remember that the 79% is an organic growth target. And if you go back over the past five years and you strip out the impact from new deals and portfolio acquisitions and new value props, organic growth tends to be in that 7% to 9% range. And that\u2019s typically what we build the plan around. It also assumes that we\u2019re still operating in this relatively weak retail environment that\u2019s growing around 2% to 3%.", "So we didn\u2019t include any lift from potential wage growth or we didn\u2019t build in any material gains and consumer confidence. So given those dynamics and the growing balances at 7% to 9% with retail sales growing in the 2% range is a pretty good result. And, obviously, based on my earlier comments, we\u2019ve got a really strong pipeline of new deals. And we\u2019re working really hard to bring those on. Those would help us maybe be a little bit better than this.", "And obviously, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to do, but we tend to build the plan around organic growth and don\u2019t include things that are uncertain or that we don\u2019t know about.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. But just a follow-up on that point, I mean, I think BP - wasn\u2019t VP like your biggest contributor in organic growth and didn\u2019t that lap kind of in the first half of the year, so the 12% run rate you are at in the back half of the year is relatively close to a clean organic number, right?", "Brian Doubles", "Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it, because again remember we strip out value proposition changes too when we think about that. So we had a very significant change to the value prop at Walmart, Amazon is largely in the comps now. But that\u2019s certainly giving us some lift in 2016. So we don\u2019t build those things in and then sometimes those can happen midyear and help the results quite a bit. But you\u2019re right on BP. We also brought on Mattress Firm, Guitar Center and some others that are in the past couple years.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Got it. Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "Thanks. Good morning. Margaret, I had a follow-up question for you on your earlier comments around the competitive reward dynamics that we\u2019re seeing. It seems to us like you guys are relatively more isolated from the rewards for dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the general purpose space. Do you agree with that characterization? And do you think that puts Synchrony on a relative damage in anyway?", "Margaret Keane", "Well, I think - I would say, yes. And I think part of that is driven by the fact that when we think about value prop and rewards. It\u2019s really within the context of our partners. And if you really look at someone who would use our card consistently, they would save more money and get more benefits over time if they use their cards every time they go into our partner. So I think if you really looked at the richness of our rewards, they\u2019re actually better and the consumer can really get some real advantages there.", "So I do think we are a bit outside of the big reward programs. And it really does come down to a consumer who has real brand loyalty to a particular partner, who sees the value that they\u2019re getting on their card and continually use that card and feel like they\u2019re really gaining some real advantage by the rewards that we put together for those particular programs.", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s great. Thank you. Brian, I had a question for you on the - on your allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period-end receivables. Assuming that the credit environment remains unchanged from where it is today, would the year-over-year change in that ratio continue to rise gradually higher at the same trajectory that we\u2019ve been seeing as credit continues to normalize or would it flatten out at some point? I\u2019m not looking to kind of get you to commit to where the ratio is going to go, but we\u2019d just love to hear your just brought thoughts on the mechanics of how that works at this point in the cycle.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure. I mean, obviously as charge-offs are normalizing, you would expect the reserve percentage on receivable to continue to increase. And the best way for you to model that I think is we\u2019d expect reserve coverage, and again, this is not how we book the reserve, but we would expect reserve coverage against future net charge-offs to be in that 14 to 15 months of coverage range. So I think if you take your charge-off forecast and you back into what the reserves will need to be to maintain that coverage ratio, that should give you a pretty good way to think about it.", "So more specific to your question, as charge-offs start to level off, and we do expect normalization will level off at some point, when that happens you would expect coverage increases to level off as well. And you get to more of a steady state. Now, I can\u2019t give you a quarter as to when exactly that\u2019s going to happen, but at some point in the future and certainly post 2017 at some point, we would expect that to happen, and so those two should level off together.", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Very helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I guess, just on that last point I do think historically you talked about something around 4.75% to 5% being normal for charge-offs. And clearly you said you don\u2019t expect this to be the year where charge-offs inevitably level off. But do you still feel comfortable that that\u2019s the range where we should expect charge-offs to begin to level off?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, right. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given a normalized charge-off level. We\u2019ve kind of given you annual guidance as we see things. And part of the reason for that is there is clearly a lot of variables that go into that. You kind of have to pick an economic scenario. You have to pick unemployment number, jobs, wage growth, confidence, all those things in order to provide that.", "So we give you our best outlook for the next 12 months. We feel like we have a pretty good visibility around that. We\u2019ve done that for 2017. I think importantly, as you think about normalization, normalization assuming all else being equal, and you\u2019re still in this favorable environment, credit should - the credit trend should level off at some point. But again it\u2019s hard to pick a quarter in terms of when that is actually going to happen.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. And maybe if I could ask a question on the RSA, clearly this past year was impacted by the large reserve builds. And now you\u2019re talking about going back to 4.4% to 4.5%, which was similar to 2015 levels now. Now, I think you didn\u2019t have any provision growth that year. So I\u2019m just trying to marry a couple of different things. The efficiency ratio is going up. We are saying charge-offs are going up and there is a potential that loan growth is decelerating.", "So I\u2019m just trying to understand like why would be RSA be going up under that environment. Couldn\u2019t we infer that you can have - the provision growth is clearly going to slow or retailers getting a bigger share? And then I guess, you did comment that Payment Solutions could grow faster, which doesn\u2019t have RSA attached to it. I\u2019m just trying to think about all those different comments together and tying it to the RSA.", "Brian Doubles", "Yeah. So obviously, there is a lot of moving pieces here and we talked about it on the past. You have to factor in all aspects of the program. So to your point, margin, credit, operating expense, you\u2019ve got program mix, the deal structures are all different and have different tiers and you also have growth. So all of those things have to be factored in. And again I recognize it\u2019s difficult for you guys to model, that\u2019s why we tell you what we think it\u2019s going to be for the year.", "And maybe one way to think about it, Ryan, is that, you alluded to 2015, so if you take 2015 for a second, just drop 2016 from a minute, we reported a 4.4% RSA in 2015. And then if you do a comparison to what we are guiding to for 2017, you will see that for 2017 our efficiency ratio is planned to be much better than it was in 2015 and the margins will also be better. And so you have those two dynamics offset with higher provisions. And that gets you back to a similar kind of RSA rate.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Ketron", "Hey, Vanessa, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. Thanks. I guess, just a follow-up on the questions on Amazon. Would you be willing to just talk a little bit about what portion of the customers use that promotional financing, because I was interested by the comments, Brian, about the revolve rates going up, because I would imagine the customers that Chase might attract away would be people that might be more of convenience user type and perhaps not the ones that would be your core customer in any case?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes, I think, basically, we probably target different customer basis between the Chase program and ours. We don\u2019t really disclose what the percentage of people who take the value prop. But if you think about the products that Amazon sells, big ticket TVs, whatever, that\u2019s what you usually see us being offered as, as one of opportunities for the customer to go after.", "I think the other maybe people think of prime customers as prime customers, and they\u2019re not necessarily all prime customers, right? So obviously, we\u2019ll go little deeper than Chase would go. So I think our target markets are slightly different so that\u2019s why in terms of how we think of the overall Amazon program, we still think that has plenty of opportunity for us to really sit side-by-side with Chase, what we\u2019ve been doing over the years. I think the real different here is the value props are now matched.", "So we\u2019ll continue to watch and then see what the impact is. We knew about program before it was launched. It was built into our 2017 guidance. So we still - I mean, listen, it\u2019s a great program and we feel great about our partnership. And what we are doing with Amazon. There\u2019s still tons of opportunity there.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. And just a follow-up, I think the definition of organic growth that you used kind of surprised me, because it\u2019s actually more conservative than I would have thought. I mean most of - I think other companies generally would have considered value prop changes and other things like that as organic growth. Is there any way you could kind of just approximate what those value prop changes have benefited the growth rate in the last few years, like is it 1 point, is it 2 points?", "Brian Doubles", "So just to be clear on that, we absolutely build in any value props that we know about or that have been agreed to with our partners. So if we were sitting here today in January and we knew that in March or June we were going to rollout a new value prop on one of our programs, we would obviously build that into our plans and we\u2019d build that into the outlook. What we don\u2019t build in are things that are just being kind of discussed and are very preliminary at this point.", "It\u2019s really hard to go back over time and we certainly tried internally. I am not going to give you percentage. But it\u2019s hard to strip out and say, okay, here\u2019s what purchase volume would have been if we were just doing weekly, monthly promotions versus an everyday value prop. We certainly have a view on that when we launched these things, but it\u2019s hard to go back over the past two or three years, and strip that out entirely for you. What I can tell you though is there - go ahead.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "I was just going to say, but there has been some upside to it over the last several\u2026", "Brian Doubles", "Absolutely, I mean, if you look at - think about the three big value props that we launched in last two years, Walmart 3-2-1 the most recent one, the Sam\u2019s Club value prop and Amazon. Those clearly helped our growth rates. And we\u2019d be really excited to continue to do that. We are in discussions with all of our partners on beefing up the value propositions on the cards. We just don\u2019t build in anything that we don\u2019t know about at this point.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes.", "Greg Ketron", "Hey, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day.", "Operator", "And thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide an overview of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.", "I'll begin on Slide 3. Second quarter net earnings totaled $496 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Consistent execution of our strategy yielded solid performance across our sales platform. Organic growth remains the priority and help to drive double-digit loan receivables and net interest income growth. Additionally, purchase volume was up 6% and average active accounts were up 5% over the second quarter of last year. These metrics are highlighted on Slide 4 of today\u2019s presentation.", "Our focus on continuing to drive incremental value to our partners and card holders is helping us to generate growth across the business. Particularly, the investments we have been making to extend our digital capabilities are having an impact on our performance. For Retail Card, our online and mobile purchase volume grew 18%, exceeding U.S. growth trends which has been around 14% to 15% and our digital sales penetration was 23% in the second quarter.", "Moving to credit quality, net charge-offs came in at 5.42% this quarter compared to 4.51% last year. Provision for loan losses was up 30% driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build this quarter 325 million in-line with our expectation. Brian will provide more details on credit later in the call.", "The efficiency ratio was 30.1% for the quarter versus 31.9% last year as we continue to generate positive operating leverage. An important funding objective for us is expanding our deposit base and we continue to execute strong deposit growth this quarter. Overall, deposits increased $6 billion or 14% to $53 billion. deposits now comprise 72% of our funding sources.", "Competitive rates and customer service should help us to continue to grow deposits, so I will note that over the longer term we expect for that growth trends to be more in-line with our receivables growth.", "Regarding capital on liquidity, our common equity Tier-1 ratio was 17.4% and liquid assets totaled $15 billion or 17% of total assets at quarter end. During the quarter we announced a new capital plan that meaningfully increases our capital returns to shareholders. Under the new plan we had increased our dividend to $0.15 per share and can repurchase up to 1.64 billion of our common stock.", "Looking at the business highlights this quarter, we signed a new partnership with zulily an e-commerce retailer, to launch their first private label credit card program. The launch of the zulily credit card is expected in late 2017 or early 2018. And will provide millions of customers an additional payment options with added value to card holders. Additionally QBC\u2019s card holders will have expanded card utility as they will be able to use their card to make purchases on zulily.", "We continue to seek new partnerships to augment growth and we are excited to launched our new program with Nissan and Infiniti during the quarter. The new co-branded cars enabled qualified card holders to earn points to the purchase or lease of new or certified pre-owned vehicles. Plan can also be used for the purchase of automotive services and accessories or be redeemed in the form of statement credit. During the quarter, we were happy to a renew existing relationships with MEGA Group USA, City Furniture and National Veterinary Associates.", "Turning to Slide 5, I\u2019ll spend a few moments on our sales platform performance. We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the second quarter. In retail card, we grew loan receivables 10% over last year, reflecting broad based growth across our partner programs. Purchase volume grew 7% and average active accounts growth was 3%. Interest and seasonal loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnership with zulily and the launch of our Nissan, Infiniti program.", "We have developed strong long-term relationship that solidify our position space, helping us to drive strong organic growth and provide the foundation to the addition of new profitable partnerships. We continue to build out our mobile capabilities and leverage our recent acquisition of GPShopper, who has helped us to develop or Synchrony Plug-In or Sy-Pi capability.", "Sy-Pi is a native credit feature that plugs into a retailer\u2019s mobile app. It allows retailers credit card holders easily shop, redeem rewards, and securely manage and make payments to their accounts with their smartphones. Though in the early stages 12 of our retailers\u2019 app are utilizing the technology and we have seen a notable increase in usage by card holders. Bill payments have increased significantly, to-date approximately 160 million in payments have been processed through the app. In total, we have had over eight million visits to the plug-in since we launch it.", "Payment solutions also delivered a solid quarter, broad based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products resulted in loan receivables growth of 11%. Purchase volume grew 6% excluding the impact in the loss of sales due to the HHGregg bankruptcy. Average active accounts were up 11% and interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth.", "We are pleased to have renewed programs that MEGA Group USA and City Furniture during the quarter. And we continue to enhance our Synchrony Car Care program adding additional utility to nearly three million card holders to excess to more than 185,000 fuel stations nationwide and we continue to extent card we use in payment solutions, which represented 27% of purchase volume in the second quarter.", "CareCredit also delivered strong quarter, receivables growth of 11% was led by a dental and veterinary specialties, purchase volume grew 11% and average active accounts were up 10%. Interest and fees on loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. We recently renewed our relationship with National Veterinary Associates, the largest owner of free standing veterinary hospitals in the U.S.", "We also announced in a multi-year agreement with Athletico Physical Therapy. This relationship provide patients of athletics over 370 physical and occupational therapy facilities across the country full access to CareCredit\u2019s health, wellness and personal care credit card. We continue to strength in our position in core elective and dental specialties with over 200,000 provider location and over 75% penetration in several key specialties.", "CareCredit is moving into additional areas including team management, orthopedics, primary care, medical diagnostics and durable medical equipment with nearly 5,000 practices added over the past 12 months. The provider locator has become an important resource for card holders and we are now seeing over 800,000 hits per month. The network expansion and increased use of the card has help drive reuse, which represented 53% of purchase volume in the second quarter.", "Each platform delivered strong results and continue to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders.", "I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks Margaret. I will turn on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter Synchrony earned $496 million of net income which translates to $0.61 per diluted share. We continue to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 12% over last year. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we\u2019ve generated across the business.", "Purchase volume grew 6% over last year. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth which increased 5% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances and spend with growth in average balance per average active account of 6% compared to last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables.", "While we had strong top-line growth and positive operating leverage in the quarter, which we share with our retailers, RSAs were up only five million from last year. This was due to higher incremental provision expense and loyalty program expense that I will touch on shortly.", "RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.6% for the quarter, down from 4% last year. Given this, we now think RSAs will run closer to 4% for 2017. The provision for loan losses increased 30% over last year, driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build in the quarter was 325 million which was in-line with the expectations we laid out in the first quarter earnings call. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail when we will review Slide eight later.", "Other income was 26 million lower than the prior year due mainly to higher loyalty expense which increased 71 million compared to the prior year. 37 million of the increase in loyalty expense was largely driven by growth. The remaining 34 million of the increase related to higher redemption rates we experienced over the last few months in one of our programs. This updated estimate relates to rewards that were earned in 2016 through the first quarter of 2017. Adjusting for that, the growth in loyalty program expense was more in-line with our historical run rate.", "Going forward we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near a 100% with some quarterly fluctuations. And as I noted previously we share loyalty program expense with the retailers through the RSA, and this did lower the RSA level in the second quarter as well as our expectation for the year. Partially offsetting the impact of higher loyalty expense and other income was an $18 million pre-tax gain from a small transaction relating to the sale of merchant acquiring relationships to a third-party during the quarter.", "Other expenses increased 72 million or 9% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth including strategic investments in our sales pipelines and our direct deposit program as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.1%, nearly a 180 basis point improvement over the 31.9% ratio last year. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage.", "I will move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trend. Net interest income was up 13% driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.2% up 26 basis points over last year. Compared to last year, there are few key drivers worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a slightly higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we are holding and have deployed excess liquidities to support our strong receivables growth.", "The yield on receivables was up 15 basis points compared to the prior year. Revolve rate improved compared to the prior year, and we received a modest benefit from the increase in the prime rate over the past year. Lastly funding cost improved by two basis points driven by a slightly more favorable funding mix.", "Our deposit base increased by $6 billion and with 72% of our funding sources versus 71% a year-ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources, so the margin benefited from this shift and the funding mix to lower cost deposit. So overall we continue to be pleased with our net interest margin performance and given these trends we continue to expect the margin for the full-year to be between 16% and 16.25%.", "Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As we have noted previously, we continue to anticipate credit will normalize from the levels we experienced over the past couple of years, we expect this normalization to occur overtime driven by a number of factors including the portfolio and channel mix, account maturation and seasoning, and consumer and payment behaviors.", "In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.25% compared to 3.79% last year, and 90 plus delinquencies were 1.06% versus 1.67% last year.", "Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.42%, compared to 4.51% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCO continues to be normalization. The second quarter of last year also included approximately 15 basis points of benefit from higher recoveries which did not repeat.", "Given what we have seen so far, we expect NCOs to be in the low 5% range for 2017 with normalization being a key driver. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter. It\u2019s important to note that while NCO rate was 5.33% last quarter and 5.42% this quarter, we do see a fairly significant seasonal impact that typically results in a lower NCO levels in the third quarter.", "The allowance to the loan losses is percent of receivables with 6.63% and the reserve build from the first quarter was 325 million in-line with our expectation. Looking forward, based on what we are seeing across the portfolio and assuming economic conditions are stable, our expectation continues to be a loss rate in the low to mid 5% range for 2018 with lot just trending somewhat higher into the first half of 2018 then starting to level off in the second half of the year. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter.", "Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, given credit normalization and strong growth, we continue to believe the reserve build for the third quarter will likely be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw in the first and second quarter of this year.", "As we move into 2018, we expect that reserve build will transition to be more growth driven given our expectation that loses began to level off in the second half of 2018.", "In summary, while credit will continue to normalize form here and impact our near-term operating results, we continue to see very good opportunities for continued growth and attractive risk adjusted return.", "Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at 911 million up 9% over last year. Expenses continue to be mainly driven by growth and strategic investment. As I noted earlier efficiency ratio is 30.1% nearly 180 basis point improvement over last year as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business.", "Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as our capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business.", "Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by 6 billion, primarily to our direct deposit program. This puts deposit at 72% of our funding slightly higher than the 71% level were operating at last year.", "We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capability. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in-line with our receivables growth.", "Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. We had two very successful debt transactions during the quarter, a 750 million five-year fixed rate senior note issuance and 822 million in ADS issuance, we saw strong demand on both transaction. In terms of our funding plan going forward. We will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017.", "Funding through securitizations with 17% of our funding consistent with our target of 15% to 20%. Our third-party debt now total 11% of our funding sources within our 10% to 15% target. So overall, we saw very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources.", "Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.4% CET1 under the transition rules and 17.2% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 18% on a fully phased-in basis last year reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our previous capital plans and growth.", "Total liquidity was 21.9 billion, which is equal to 24% of our total assets. This is down from 25.5% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.", "During the quarter, we completed the capital plan we announced last July and paid a common stock dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock fulfilling the 952 million in share purchases, our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017.", "In May, were pleased to announce our new capital plan through June 30, 2018. Our board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and a share repurchase program of up to 1.64 billion, which we began to execute in May repurchasing 200 million during the quarter in addition to the 238 million repurchase technically to prior program for a total of 438 million of repurchases in the second quarter.", "This represented 15.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter slightly more than double what we have been averaging in the prior three quarters. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and acquired approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously.", "We have built a very strong balance sheet with diversify funding sources, a strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital to the growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividend and share repurchases.", "Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view on 2017. Given the strong receivables growth and higher revolve rates we\u2019ve seen so far this year, we continue to believe the margin for the full-year will be in the 16 to 16 and a quarter range, this demonstrates one of the natural offsets in the business, some are the same factors driving credit normalization also resolved in the higher receivables yield. So we are seeing a partially offset on the revenue line. We expect NCOs to be in the low-5% range for the full -year 2017 normalization will continue to be a largest factor.", "Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, given credit normalization and strong growth; we continue to believe the reserves build for the third quarter will likely be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw in the first and second quarter this year. As we move into 2018, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth driven, given our expectation that losses will begin to level off in the second half of 2018.", "We now think RSAs will run closer to 4% given the impact of reserve build and somewhat higher loyalty program expenses due to higher redemption expectations which are also shared with retailers through the RSA.", "And while we continue to generate positive operating leverage, it is favorably impacting the efficiency ratio. We expect the efficiency ratio to run closer to 31.5% for the full-year. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments as well as holiday marketing campaigns that run in the second half.", "In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive long-term returns. Assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer consistent going forward, our expectations that reserve builds will moderate into 2018 which combined with the continued growth of the business and the impact on the substantial increase in our share repurchase program will help us generate EPS growth in 2018.", "Before I turn the call over to Margaret, I wanted to let you know that we will begin filing an 8-K showing our managed data for delinquencies, net charge-offs and end of period as well as average loan balances on a monthly basis.", "For the last month of each quarter we will provide the monthly data in conjunction with the filing of our quarterly financial results. We will be filing the first 8-K with this data after the market closes today which will provide you historical monthly information dating back to January of 2015 you can see the monthly trend and in August we will start filing the 8-K in conjunction with our monthly Master Trust filing.", "I know many of you will find this helpful. And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Brian. I will provide a quick wrap up and then we will open the call for Q&A. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities, driving strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms, renewing several existing programs by also signing a new private label credit card program and launching a new co-brand program.", "We continue to drive solid deposit growth in support of our business development. We are also pleased to have announced a meaningful increase in our capital return to shareholders through our new dividend and share repurchase program.", "We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, not only through dividends and share repurchases but also through the continued growth of our business, with a focus on maintaining strong returns and a solid balance sheet as we do so.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I would like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.", "Operator, please start the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And we have our first question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask if you guys could give a little bit more color on what is behind that change that we saw in loyalty rewards expense exceeding interchange this quarter and I had a couple of related follow-ups on that, but perhaps maybe we could start there.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes sure Bill this Brian. Look it is really isolated to one of our programs where we made a couple of changes to make it easier for our customers to redeem their rewards. We believe this is a positive for the consumer to drive more loyalty to the retailer, more visit, more purchases, it\u2019s going to drive incremental sales over the long run.", "It is again isolated to the one program we highlighted about 34 million of that related to 2016 rewards in the first quarter of 2017. So when you factor in that change, our redemption rate for the total company now is running above 95%. So, even if we were to get to a 100% redemption across the board, when you factor in the RSA offset the future impact will be pretty small.", "Bill Carcache", "Got it, okay. So the redemption rate assumption is 95% even if that went to a 100% that\u2019s not - that would have a material impact?", "Brian Doubles", "It would not have a material impact, the impact would be pretty small just given there is an RSA offset as the partners share in those costs. The best way to think about this going forward, if you adjust for that $34 million in the quarter, loyalty as a percent of interchange was around a 100% and that\u2019s probably a good way to think about it going forward.", "Bill Carcache", "Okay, great and we have kind of spent a lot of time talking about that relationship RSAs and credit and hadn\u2019t necessarily been thinking about RSAs in relation to the reward expense as much, but it sounds like that is a permanent relationship, it\u2019s like loyalty resets permanently higher, I guess is a question is that reasonable to expect that the RSAs will also reset permanently lower?", "Brian Doubles", "That you know, again the RSAs I know keep the like to focus on the RSAs as an offset to credit, we have been pretty clear that the RSAs are really based on the entire P&L, so it includes revenue, it includes loyalty expense, it includes credit, and all that, a couple of cases it includes the reserve build, it includes expenses and so it really is a complete sharing of the entire profitability of the program and so, the RSAs that we saw adjustments to our estimate in the quarter absolutely ramped to the RSA and it was an offset there.", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s great, very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes thanks Bill.", "Operator", "We have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great thanks. I guess first Brian you had mentioned that your expectations for credit losses are pretty much consistent with what you had said three months ago. You had shown us some vintage charge that showed that the second half of 2016 was performing better and can you kind of update that tell us how that\u2019s trending?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, Moshe. We have only gone here a couple months past when we published us back in April, so I would say the vintages are performing very much in-line with our expectations, we are still seeing the benefit from the underwriting changes that we have made in the second half of 2016 flow through, so we still see that can have a 2016 vintage is better than the first half of 2016. And that\u2019s at least in part what is giving us some comfort that losses will start to level off in the back half of 2018.", "The underwriting changes that we made in the second half of 2016 and that we have continue to make in the first half of 2017 those are largely going to benefit in the 2018 loss rates. So I would say based on an updated those vintage curves everything we are seeing is pretty much in-line with what we showed you in April.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great. just to kind of follow-up on a similar theme, couple of other private label players City and ADS have reported recently. And seem to be, I guess, maybe get your sense as to whether, your results or kind of leading or lagging, because City had kind of taken up its expectation for credit losses, now as oppose to you guys which had kind of done that a few months back and the ADS had talk about some issues with respect to recovery, something that you had also addressed. So maybe just given that everybody is kind of looking at all of the peers, maybe could you put in context kind of the timing of your disclosures. I mean, do you feel like you have been ahead of those factors?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, I think the general trends are all very similar as you look across issuers. I think credit normalization trends are consistent. But I do think, you are seeing a little bit of variation in terms of which quarter in particular summer starting to see or change our view on the go forward projection. So I think based on - and you can actually, if you go back over the past couple of years and you look at where issuers saw really strong growth, that will differ as well by issuers by a quarter or two.", "For us, we saw really strong growth in 2015 for first half of 2016. And right now in 2017, we are working our way through the peak kind of loss rates for those vintages. Second half of 2016 will be maturing in the second half of 2018 and so that\u2019s where we will start to see the benefits on the underwriting changes we\u2019ve made. So it\u2019s hard to comment generally, I think the trends across all the issuers are very consistent. But I think everybody is seeing this materialize in maybe a different quarter.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Perfect. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you. Good morning. And thank for giving us the monthly data going forward. I guess, first question back on credit quality and maybe following on most of the questions. As far as recoveries are concern. What is the game plan going forward here, because ADS has talked about bringing all that stuff in-house? Could you maybe just talk about where you are at with the recovery game plan?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. I would say recovery pricing was generally pretty stable this quarter. This is an area that we continue to watch pretty closely. I mentioned last quarter that we run regular analysis on these sales and we compare the results of the debt sales other methods of collecting on the account. So we are always making those trade-off and we are always trying to optimize different strategy.", "If we start to see the pricing deteriorate further, we may pull back on some of these sales and collect on the accounts for other means but we haven\u2019t made a dramatic shift in our strategy and haven\u2019t reached that decision point yet. But it\u2019s something we evaluate every month internally.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "I guess, following on that, maybe one other question is do you have the capacity to do all of the collections in-house or would that be another step-up in costs to build that out. And then just secondly on RSAs, they are obviously tracking below your guidance for the year and as we sort of calculate what the ROA needs to be, to get to the RSA level that you are guiding to. I mean that would probably represent a pretty decent step up in ROAs for the second half for the year. Is that the way to think about it, I mean it\u2019s like a 30 basis point pick-up in the ROA if I calculate it I think? Or is there something else that we should consider, when we are thinking about the RSA level that you are guiding to for the year? Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure, let me do the recovery one first. So on recoveries, we would go through a transition period. Day one, we wouldn\u2019t bring it all in-house. We would be thoughtful around how we manage that transition. Obviously there is a short-term implication, there is a long-term implication. You would be a step-up in cost as move some of that in-house or to other collection strategies. But if we felt like that we are getting a good return on our investment over the long-term that\u2019s something we would certainly consider. But we would have to build out some additional infrastructure and add some cost related to that.", "On the RSAs, I think if you think about where we started the year, we were 3.7 last quarter, we are 3.6 this quarter. You really have to remember that the second half of the year we had a seasonal high, particularly had a seasonal high in the third quarter that typically coincides with the seasonal low point on net charge-off. So this just that dynamic alone as you move from the second into the third and then into the fourth quarter, RSA percentages come up. And we think that puts us back right around 4% for the full-year.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe just a little bit more clarity on the credit outlook. So if my math were correct gross charge-offs are up roughly 70 bps in the first quarter and may be a little bit below that in the second quarter. As we look out through the back half of the year, should we expect that pace to continue and then some variability on the recoveries and when would you expect us to see the gross charge-offs begin to decelerate and maybe any color you can give us in terms of the 4Q build?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, so Ryan. Look I think generally the trends like I said are in-line with our expectations. The one thing that you have to factor in, let\u2019s just talk about seasonality for a bit, we do see a fairly significant seasonal drop in NCOs in the third quarter. So you have to make sure that you are modeling that right. That\u2019s certainly included in our guidance. And then just well around the topic of seasonality its probably just worth a reminder that we also see a seasonal increase in delinquencies in the second half of the year.", "So you just got to make sure that you are taking that all into account, but we feel pretty good about 2017. like I said this is a transition year. This is where we are kind of hitting the peak of the 2015 and first half of 2016 vintages. The underwriting changes that we have made are largely going to benefit 2018. And so that\u2019s really where we are focused.", "The reserve build in the quarter gives you a fairly good indication that is in-line with our expectations and now we have picked up the first half of 2018, so that should give you some comfort that things are trending more or less in-line with what we expected.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Just as a quick follow-up I guess just on a year-over-year basis how should we expect it to trend? And then second just for the NIM, you are obviously running towards the high end of guidance and historically speaking we do see a pickup in the back half of the year as we see lower revenue suppression, an uptick in late fees. If you could maybe just clarify what are some of the offsetting factors that would cause you to not be above the 1625 on NIM? Thanks for taking my question.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure. Look other than giving you the full-year and you\u2019ve got the first two quarters to work with, I think that should help you model the third quarter and the fourth quarter pretty closely. I think the thing I just reiterate is you got to factor in the seasonal decrease in the third quarter that comes back up in the fourth.", "In terms of the margin, look we are very pleased with how we started the year. We are up 26 basis points over last year in the quarter. Receivable yield was up 15 basis points with stronger revolve rate, we got a benefit from the increase in the prime rate, we did have a partial offset from interest and fee reversals which you would expect to see in-line with credit normalization.", "And then we have done I think a nice job optimizing the liquidity that we are holding on the balance sheet. As you think about the second half for the year, we do typically get a seasonal lift in yield in the second half for the year; however, there is going to be a couple offsets we think.", "First, I think we will probably see slightly higher deposit betas than we have seen so far in the rate cycle. Nothing dramatic, but probably just a little bit higher than what we have seen so far in the first 100 basis points maybe a little more competition on rates in the second half.", "And then I think we are also likely to get a little less benefit from higher revolve rate in the second half just getting some of the changes we made on underwriting. So think there will be some puts and takes but that probably puts us back between the 16, 16 and a quarter range for the full-year.", "Ryan Nash", "Thanks for the color Brian.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Beth Lynn Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck", "Hi, good morning. On just probably with [indiscernible] you mentioned slightly higher due to the revolve rate you said you expect given your changes that you have slightly lower revolve rate, could you just explain what changes you made to drive to that outcome?", "Brian Doubles", "Well the revolve rate tends to ebb and flow in-line with credit normalization, so we have seen a fairly substantial benefit on revolve rate starting in the second half of last year. We continue to see that through the first half and I think that will just moderate a bit heading into the second half of this year.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck", "Okay, and then on the outlook for RSA, I know you had a couple conversations on this already, but question is coming into this quarter you indicated the reserve that you were looking for to hit that, that was great and expecting that reserve build again in 3Q. I understand that the credit improves in 3Q, but should we expect that that there is a like for like improvement in RSA even with what is going to be still a little bit higher reserve build in the third quarter or is there some cushion in the RSA outlook that you are giving us?", "Brian Doubles", "No, we started the year remember around 4.5%, we took it down last quarter to 4.1% to 4.2% and now we are staying around 4%. Part of that is a combination of what we are seeing on credit, plus the additional loyalty costs that we had in the quarter, those are really the two driver.", "And then how you get from 3.6%, 3.7% range to 4% for the full-year is really seasonality. Go back over the last three years and you look at the increase from the second quarter to the third quarter and then into the fourth you always see an increase in the RSA, some of that is driven by lower net charge offs, some of that is program specific but that increase will be there in the third quarter and we think combination of those things puts us background 4% for the full-year.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck", "Okay and then lastly, on the capital return and a dividend hike that you announced earlier this quarter, could you just give us a sense as to whether the timing of your decisions on capital returns has now changed going forward, should we expect that you are going to be making these kind of decisions shortly after second quarter is over timeframe or will you go back to releasing at the same time as the rest of the industry even though you are not CCAR required?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes I mean we were about a month early I think, we got through our process with our board and with our regulators and we were very pleased to be able to announce the capital plan when we did. We were able to take advantage some of that in the quarter. We repurchased about 200 million of the allotment in the quarter. So where we have a little bit of flexibility, we are trying to be opportunistic around that and we will continue to do that.", "But I don\u2019t think, we are going to be much ahead of timing wise, what we announced this quarter. I think we are still following a very similar process, we are using the same scenarios that gets published early in the year. We run our models, we review it with obviously the Management Team, the Risk Committee and the Board. And our Regulators and this year that put us right around the May timeframe that\u2019s probably not a bad way to think about it going forward, but it could lag a month and we could be close sort of where the peers are in that.", "Elizabeth Lynn Graseck", "Right okay. All right, thanks a lot Brian.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.", "James Friedman", "Hi. Brian I let you take breath and Margaret I was going to ask you couple of questions if I could.", "Margaret Keane", "Brian really appreciates that.", "James Friedman", "I was going to ask you about the Sy-Pi that you had mentioned at the outset. So where should we be seeing that show-up the most significantly, you mentioned a number of retailers that you have that have adopted it, I think you gave another volume based metric. But where in the financials, do you think that that will show up most significantly? And then I have one quick follow-up.", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. You will see that in growth in particularly kind of our mobile growth. So the way the Sy-Pi works, it\u2019s an App that easily integrates to the retailer\u2019s App that\u2019s why we call it plug-in. So it\u2019s very easy to the retailer to execute upon, because most of the work is on our side. And it integrates [indiscernible] so it\u2019s a very seamless smooth process for the customer as they are going through their process of credit and using their credit card and paying and all those types of things getting their reward. So you will see it in growth and our engagement from a mobile perspective just continues to grow and that\u2019s really where you will see that.", "James Friedman", "Okay. Is it fair that say that sort of technology maybe influencing the loyalty observation that you are making more company-wide, if it\u2019s easier to use your rewards people will?", "Margaret Keane", "Not necessary as Brian said there was one program in particular where we need to change. But I would say that in general, the way we think about loyalty is the real positive for us. So the more the customers are aware of the rewards. Our analytic show that if we get them to go back any unused reward, they tend to have a bigger basket and shop more. So for us this circular process of issuing rewards make it easy for the customer, having them go back into our partners to shop is a real class.", "And as Brian said, the rewards are offset in RSA. So it\u2019s really a win-win for both of us. Right we are helping to generate sales for the customer this higher engagement of that customer with our retailer and in the recent environment we are in, anything we can do to make that customer more sticky is a real positive.", "James Friedman", "Okay. I just had one more. On the digital side, you gave that disclosure, 18% increase, I thought you said online. I get this question a lot is that because you happen to have one extremely prominent ecommerce retailer or is that more of an observation about wallet penetration throughout your retail base? Thank you.", "Margaret Keane", "It\u2019s more wallet penetration across our retail base. I would just generally say, I know everyone looks at the one retailer, but we have a lot of retailers who have online mobile capability and that\u2019s just an area with everything else is growing. So things like having Sy-Pi to help integrate through the App, as I dais we have 12 retailers already involved in that. We are going to continue roll out more, I think you are going to continue to see this be a big part of how customer shop.", "James Friedman", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.", "Richard Shane", "Hey, guys. Actually Jamey\u2019s question was a pretty good segway. I know you are not going to comment too specifically, but can you help us think about any seasonal impacts that we might see in the third quarter results related to Amazon Prime Day, obviously it\u2019s a pretty significant event, I just want to make sure we understand how it runs through the numbers?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. We can\u2019t really comment on one particular retailer. What I will tell you is that we initiated Amazon 5% off back in second quarter 2015. We are very pleased with the overall programs to-date. It continues a positive growth story for us. And you could read through Amazon had a great day. So we are very pleased with the partnership.", "Brian Doubles", "And you will see it in the third quarter.", "Richard Shane", "Such that might be impacted by that we should be thinking about?", "Brian Doubles", "No Rick I think.", "Margaret Keane", "No, we can\u2019t one partner.", "Brian Doubles", "Look it\u2019s, you will see whatever impact is there in the growth numbers for the company. But I would highlight that we are pretty diversified across all of our retail partners and its where that you would see even and I am as significant as Amazon Prime Day have a dramatic impact on our overall results.", "Margaret Keane", "We have some big partners in that.", "Brian Doubles", "Right.", "Richard Shane", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.", "David Scharf", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-up on credit. One, I know you don\u2019t provide loss data by product, but just curious Payment Solutions continues to be a fastest growing product, it\u2019s over 20% balances now, and those are obviously all promotional balances. Brian, as you look at overall normalization in your commentary about second half 2016 has been performing better than first half. Had there been any meaningful changes in the magnitude of promotions over the last 12, 18 months that maybe impacting the pace of normalization? Just trying to get a sense for whether or not those promotional balances are consisting of the typical interest rate period or whether there were any changes that have contributed to the pace of normalization?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, no I wouldn\u2019t attribute it to promotional balances. We have seen strong growth in the Payment Solutions, but I would say the trends in Payment Solutions are similar to what we are seeing across the total company in terms of normalization.", "The one thing I have pointed out in the past is we do underwrite differently by platform, so we are actually slightly more conservative in how we underwrite in Payment Solutions just given if you look at the margins there and the top-line yield, we are working with a little bit less there than we are in CareCredit and Retail Card.", "So we underwrite a little more conservatively in Payment Solutions, given the margin in CareCredit we will underwrite a little bit deeper. CareCredit and Retail Card is fairly close to the average. So portfolio mix is absolutely a driver, but I would not attribute it to promotional balances.", "David Scharf", "Got it, that\u2019s helpful and then lastly just another quick question on the recovery side. In terms of the mix to the degree of that sales has risen in the last couple of years given pricing trends and those are reversing now has been discussed. How much of your recoveries are actually accomplished through the third channel which is outsource contingency collection, so much is focused on the debt sale side, but are you seeing - A, do use outsource collection agencies and B, are there any changes to the contingency fees, the pricing in that channel?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, we do use third-parties as well, we try and optimize across all of the recoveries strategies in the various channels and like I said earlier, we are looking at that on a monthly basis. We have run champion challenger to see where we are getting the best results and we modify and adjust the strategies as we go. I would say the majority of the impact that we have seen has largely been attributable to the market pricing on the debt sales and lesser impact in other strategies.", "David Scharf", "Okay, got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.", "Mark DeVries", "Yes, thanks. Brian I believe you indicated, we should expect to see a seasonal drop in charge-offs in 3Q and we certainly saw a significant drop in 2014 and 2015. But last year when delinquencies were actually rising which tends to mute seasonal improvements, you had a much smaller seasonal improvement in the third quarter, was there anything to call out in that that also outside of the rising delinquencies that might have dampened the seasonal improvement that are not present this year and would suggest another kind of large drop in 3Q?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, it\u2019s a good question Mark. The one thing I would highlight, in the second quarter of 2016 we spiked out of 15 basis points of incremental recoveries that we had in the second quarter of 2016 which obviously didn\u2019t repeat it either in the third quarter of 2016 or repeat this quarter obviously. So that\u2019s one thing I would point to, so maybe take the second quarter of 2016 charge-offs up by 15 basis points and then you would see more of a seasonal decline as you move from the second quarter to the third quarter.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. And then second question, I mean it sounds like you guys have done some pretty meaningful tightening to give you some comfort and the guidance around losses leveling off in the half of last year, but we haven\u2019t really seen that reflected - the growth your loan growth so far. When if it all might we expect to see growth moderate as a result of some of the underwriting moves?", "Brian Doubles", "I think you are seeing I would say to some degree in the purchase volume, we have obviously tightened, we made incremental changes here in the first half, we do expect that to have a modest impact on growth, if you look at purchase volume we were right around 7% when you adjust for HHGregg this quarter versus a run rate that was probably closer to 9% or a little above 9%. So I think that\u2019s where you are seeing it.", "We are not seeing it quite yet in the receivables still, because there is an offset on incremental revolve which is more of a consumer behavioral element that continues to drive good receivables growth. So we think there is still really good opportunities to continue to grow but I think, we are not seeing the same opportunities to grow that we saw in 2015 and at least in the first half of 2016. So I think, there will be a modest impact going forward. But generally as we look across the programs in the platforms, we are still seeing good growth opportunities that are attractive returns, just maybe not we are seeing couple of years ago.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Henry Coffey with Wedbush Securities.", "Henry Coffey", "Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And, again, the monthly data is going to be extremely helpful for, so thanks for that step forward. When you talk to about rising net charge-offs, it seem to be either a geographical or channel component to it. There were certain spots to either the store mix or the country that we were struggling more than others. Now that you have had another quarter of looking at that. Can you really comment on two related things one that and two how is the dual purpose card holding up on the credit side?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure. We have highlighted for a number of quarters now that portfolio mix component as part of normalization. For us, as we talked about our underwriting is customized and we underwrite differently whether it\u2019s by platform, by program, we target different loss rates depending on the overall profitability of those programs.", "So just depending on the growth rates in those different areas mix can certainly be a driver and that\u2019s mix by program, it can be mix by channel, it\u2019s really multi-variant, it\u2019s not as simple as just one program, one product, one retailer, it\u2019s a combination of factors.", "And I would say, what we are seeing in that regard is largely in-line with our expectation. I wouldn\u2019t attribute it as much to a geographical slice or a geographical split that\u2019s driving, it really is more portfolio mix on our side. And then did you have a second question?", "Henry Coffey", "Yes. Just unrelated, but in terms of margin. I think one everybody heard about asset sensitivity, they were looking for fairly large boost though, now we are seeing fairly small boost. What is the real dynamic there, is it just timing or is it more of funding competitive issue?", "Brian Doubles", "Look, for us, yields and margins are ahead of our expectations so far this year. If you remember, when we started a year back in January, we guided to a net interest margin of 15.75 to 16. We took that up 90 days in. We now think we will be between 16, 16 and a quarter for the year. So we continue to be slightly asset sensitive, its right around 1% under 100 basis points shock. And that\u2019s been very consistent over the last three years. That 1% kind of range hasn\u2019t really moved much.", "I do think as we get into the second half year that we may see a little more competition on deposit rate. We have seen just in the last four to six weeks, we have seen some competitors move. We have been very fortunate so far with the first 100 basis points. I think on our CDs and savings, I think we haven\u2019t moved more than 10 or 15 basis points across all those products.", "So we have had a nice little lag her. The margins have improved as a result of it. But I do think the things will get a little more competitive and we are ready to respond to that if we have to.", "Henry Coffey", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson.", "Arren Cyganovich", "Thank you. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the 2019 renewal with your retailers if you have started those discussions and if so how they have been progressing?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes, we really can\u2019t comment on what we have started or not started. But what I would say is we have to win every day, so part of the process we deal here is really making sure we are delivering for the customers and the retailers now. In many cases usually something will come up where the retailers wants to either change the value prop or expand in a certain way which will allow us the opportunities to open up the dialogue.", "So we are constantly in those discussions and we feel pretty positive about the relationship that\u2019s are coming up. The relationships we have had for very, very long time. And we are hoping and confident that we will be able to renew those relationships.", "Arren Cyganovich", "Fair enough thanks. And then just from a modeling perspective, was the 34 million higher redemption rate that caused the loyalty - is it more of a one-time item, is that something that\u2019s going to be consistent going forward?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, that\u2019s really more of a one-time item that related to 2016 rewards in first quarter 2017. And in terms of a run rate going forward, if you adjust that to 34 million and put loyalty as a percentage of interchange right around a 100% that\u2019s not a bad way to think about it going forward.", "Arren Cyganovich", "Thank you.", "Greg Ketron", "Vanessa, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht", "Thanks very much guys. Margaret, you talked about the pipeline in the last question. I\u2019m wondering maybe can you give us kind of just a commentary on any changes I guess to competitive dynamics in the marketplace?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes, sure. I think competitors have been pretty stable as we have gone through this year. I would say, there is not many big deals out there. We tend to compete more on the $1 billion and below in that space, there is plenty of opportunity.", "We continue to look at existing programs from competitors as well as start-ups. I think I have mentioned in the past we have dedicated resources in all three platforms. So we are feeling pretty good about the pipeline that we have in place and how we are winning and playing in marketplace.", "We are not going to win every deal. We try to really work on the deals that we think meet our returns and are going to be accretive to our overall portfolio. And that\u2019s kind of how we have approached it and we will continue to approach. But I don\u2019t think anyone seeing particularly crazy out there in terms of competition.", "John Hecht", "Okay, thanks for the color. And then last question is, Brian you talked about deposit data in the second half, maybe just give a little bit more color on that in terms of your outlook and then where are you going on deposit duration just to give us a sense of the pricing changes?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure, John. Look I think our expectation is that any move in deposit pricing is going to be pretty modest. I just think it\u2019s been almost non-existent so far with the first 100 basis points that\u2019s going to be slightly above that. We have seen some competitors, we have to figure in a high yield savings with more attractive offers out there, whether it\u2019s the one-time bonus or slightly better rate than they have been offering, and I think we are going to have to step-up our pricing a little bit more in the second half than we did in the first half. But I\u2019m talking about basis points here, not a wholesale change from what we have been seeing.", "John Hecht", "And then duration, where are you guys trying to issue deposit at this point?", "Brian Doubles", "We have always tried to kind of match the duration of our assets with our liabilities that\u2019s part of our funding strategy. We have been very successful in growing the high yield savings book. I would say anywhere where we can grow the longer tenure CDs right now in this environment, we are looking to do that. Obviously given where rates are there is not a lot of demand for a five year CD, where they are priced today. So we are trying to take advantage of that where we can, there is just as not much demand there as we would like to see.", "John Hecht", "Great. Thanks for the color guys.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Thanks John.", "Margaret Keane", "Thank you.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial, the Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and we hope you have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.", "In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.", "Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.", "During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company\u2019s performance.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.", "Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. We ended 2017 with a solid fourth quarter, which sets the foundation for 2018. Tax reform had an impact on our reported fourth quarter results, which Brian will cover later in the call. We expect to realize significant benefit from tax reform and we will look to utilize this benefit in a way that drives value for our shareholders, employees and communities.", "I\u2019m going to spend my time today covering our business highlights, including the expansion of the strategic credit relationship with PayPal, as well as what we achieved in 2017, and I will end with our strategic priorities. Brian will detail our financial results and our outlook for 2018 later in the call.", "A very significant and exciting development in the fourth quarter was the agreement we announced with PayPal to significantly expand and extend our strategic consumer credit relationship. In addition to extending our co-branded consumer credit card program with PayPal, we will now become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S.", "This will consolidate PayPal\u2019s two U.S. credit offerings under one relationship, which we extended with PayPal for 10 years. As part of this transaction, we will be acquiring PayPal\u2019s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, as well as interest held by other investors. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of this year.", "Moving forward with PayPal to become the exclusive issuer of PayPal Credit in the U.S. is a natural extension of our successful 13-year relationship. The extended program offers tremendous benefits for both Synchrony and PayPal. Together, we can deliver best-in-class experiences for credit customers.", "Combining our program management, credit capabilities and balance sheet with PayPal\u2019s data and risk platform and trusted brand as a leader in digital and mobile payment experiences should help create superior products and offerings for consumers and merchants.", "The two programs require our unique organizational focus, given that they address different customer needs, rewards for co-brand and financing for PayPal Credit two areas in which we have expertise. Also, having one partner to holistically manage both of these programs for PayPal will allow for synergies and could provide opportunities for migrating customers between products as their needs change.", "Our strategy will focus on optimizing three main components to drive sustained growth: the consumer value proposition, merchant differentiation and world-class digital customer experience to support ongoing engagement. This expanded relationship supports our continued reach within the rapidly growing digital payments channel. We have built a strong reputation in this space and this program will allow us to meet evolving consumer needs.", "We primarily compete on our capabilities, including our significant experience, scale, dedicated teams, data analytics, loyalty programs, digital capabilities and proven record of providing value-added services to our partners. These capabilities all played an important role in expanding our relationship with PayPal.", "We have a long history and have worked closely with them during our tenure to develop innovative and effective products and value propositions for PayPal\u2019s customers. We are obviously very pleased to be extending this important relationship as we jointly leverage the new opportunities to significantly grow this program.", "During the fourth quarter, we renewed several relationships, including Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Retail Card, Home Furnishings Association, Husqvarna Viking, and Sweetwater and Payment Solutions and Bosley and Sono Bello and CareCredit. This was obviously a very productive quarter for us and we are pleased to continue to generate growth, both organically and through the launch of new innovative programs with exciting new partnership.", "Before I pass the call over to Brian to get details on our financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2018, I\u2019d like to provide a recap of the substantial progress we made on our strategic priorities in 2017. Growing our business remains a top priority. And in 2017, we achieved this through organic growth, new deals and the renewal of several key partnerships.", "We are driving organic growth through digital innovation, data analytics and innovative marketing, promotions and value propositions on several of our cards. We had a very successful year in renewing more than 15 key relationships and winning more than 20 new deals in our three sales platforms.", "We continue to pursue new opportunities to expand our business, particularly in areas where we see outsized opportunity. PayPal is an example of this, and is especially important as it will expand our presence in the digital payment space. Another example is our efforts to further penetrate the travel and entertainment sector where appropriate and we continue to make progress in 2017 with the launch of the Cathay Pacific program.", "Extending the utility of our cards is another key focus area, particularly expanding the network in which our cards are accepted, so that our cards can move to the top of cardholders\u2019 wallets. This is especially important in our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms, where we\u2019ve been working to migrate cardholders towards more repeat purchase behavior.", "To that end, in Payment Solutions, we launched the Synchrony Car Care network, which offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations, as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide. The utility of this card continues to be enhanced with the addition of new partners, such as Mavis Discount Tire being added to the network.", "Similarly, we also launched the Synchrony home credit card network accepted by retails at more than 10,000 locations in verticals, such as home furnishing, flooring and electronics. In CareCredit, we recently announced the roll out of our new CareCredit Dual Card. This new card combines the promotional credit capabilities of the standard CareCredit card for purchases within our extensive network with the added convenience of MasterCard acceptance.", "The upgrade offers cardholders the ability to earn points for all purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted and offers enhanced rewards for health, fitness, grocery and debt-related purchases. We also further expanded the CareCredit network with our acquisition of the Citi Health Card portfolio in early 2017, and have also expanded into several new verticals, such as durable medical equipment, orthopedics and physical therapy.", "The number of provider locations increased by more than 10,000 in 2017. The progress we\u2019ve made in improving the utility, and therefore, the usage of our card is evidenced by our reuse rate. For Payment Solutions, the reuse rate in the fourth quarter was 29% and for CareCredit it was 54% of total purchase volume.", "During 2017, we continued our focus in investment on enhancing our leading-edge digital and data analytics capabilities. Early in the year, we acquired GPShopper, an innovative developer of mobile apps that offer a full suite of commerce, engagement and analytics tools and through which we launched our innovative app plug-in, we call SyPi.", "We now have 10 partners using the app plug-in and to date we\u2019ve seen a significant growth in usage. We are expanding our mobile engagement capabilities, improving the functionality and ease of use for mobile users and our partners. And this capability enhancing acquisition will help us to do that.", "We have invested in a next-generation data environment, which gives us a more holistic view of the customer and enables us to drive higher engagement and a better customer experience using disparate data sources and machine learning techniques. We now have access to approximately 70% of SKU or category level data on the over 1 billion transactions that go over our network compared to less than half of transactions just three years ago.", "This is important as we increasingly partner with retailers to leverage this information to grow their program. Additionally, we are using advanced analytic techniques, such as media mix optimization to improve return on marketing investments. Given our significant operational successes and strong growth, we have also had to focus on funding that growth and our deposit base has become an increasingly important part of that equation, especially direct deposit.", "We have made investments to enhance the online direct deposit experience for consumers, and this has helped drive direct deposit growth of 13% over the past year. Overall, deposits now comprise 73% of our total funding sources. Through all of this expansion and investment, we\u2019ve been able to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver value to our shareholders, not only through growth, but via improved capital payout distribution with both an increase in dividends and a substantial increase in share buybacks and the plan we announced last may.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to outline our financial results for the quarter and our expectations for the upcoming year.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $385 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. But this included the impact related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, driven by the lower corporate tax rates in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December.", "Excluding this impact, we earned $545 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 7% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 8% over last year. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business.", "The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 3% over last year. The slower growth compared to recent quarters was due to the underwriting refinements we have noted previously and the HHGregg bankruptcy. I will cover the impact of the underwriting refinements we\u2019ve made in more detail later in the presentation.", "As we move forward and the impact from these items are included in the prior year run rate, we would expect their impact to moderate in future quarters. We had another solid quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 4% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year.", "RSAs decreased $32 million, or 4%. While we share the strong top line growth and positive operating leverage generated in the quarter, this was offset by higher incremental provision expense. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.9% for the quarter, down from 4.5% last year.", "For the year, RSAs were 3.9% versus 4.2% in 2016, reflecting one of the natural offsets in our business model. The provision for loan losses increased 26% over last year, primarily driven by credit normalization. The reserve build in the quarter was $213 million lower than the $275 million range we had expected, driven by moderating credit normalization trends as we enter 2018 and slightly lower receivables growth. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation.", "Other income was $23 million lower than the prior year. While interchange was up $12 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense and increased by $36 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.", "As we noted last quarter, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased $52 million, or 6% versus last year, driven primarily by growth in marketing. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline our back office.", "Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter compared to 31.6% last year over a 130 basis point improvement. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage.", "I\u2019ll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 8%, driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.24% compared to last year\u2019s margin of 16.26%. The margin was largely in line with our expectation. The margin benefited from a slightly higher mix receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we\u2019re holding and have deployed excess liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.", "This was offset by a slight decline in the yield on receivables down 8 basis points from last year, as well as higher funding costs that increased by 18 basis points, driven by higher rates in our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to higher benchmark rates and prefunding related to PayPal. We will cover our expectations for the margin going forward in our 2018 outlook later.", "Next I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I\u2019ll start with the delinquency trends. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.67% compared to 4.32% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.28% versus 2.03% last year.", "Moving to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.78% compared to 4.65% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. This resulted in a 5.37% NCO rate for the year near our expectations.", "The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.8% and the reserve build from the third quarter was $213 million. As I noted earlier, the reserve build was lower than the $275 million range we expected due to moderating impact from credit normalization and somewhat slower receivables growth.", "As we look forward to 2018, I\u2019d like to describe the impact related to the underwriting refinements on our more recent vintages and our purchase volume growth.", "First, the most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. As you remember, we started making refinements to our underwriting in the second-half of 2016 and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes. Additionally, we have continued to make incremental underwriting changes throughout the year and the vintage curve data suggests that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage.", "Now surprisingly, these underwriting refinements have also resulted in changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification, we continue to grow purchase volume at a fairly strong pace in accounts with a FICO score greater than 721, which increased 10% over the same quarter last year.", "While purchase volume for the below 665 FICO range actually declined 13%, reflecting the actions we have been taking. These trends help inform our view of loss expectations in 2018 and beyond. Later, I\u2019ll provide our outlook on credit expectations for next year.", "In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of the change and the impact on our results will moderate as we move into 2018, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns.", "Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $970 million, up 6% over last year. Expenses continued to be primarily driven by growth and marketing. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter over a 130 basis point improvement over last year, as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, while continuing to fund our strategic investments.", "For the full-year, the efficiency ratio was 30.3%, down over 80 basis points from the prior year and well below our original outlook back in January of approximately 32%.", "Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.", "Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by over $4 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, slightly higher than the 72% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer-term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth.", "Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. As part of our prefunding plan for the PayPal Credit portfolio, we did issue $1 billion of 10-year fixed rate debt in the fourth quarter, which was very well received by the market. We will continue to execute our prefunding plan as we prepare to onboard the PayPal portfolio in the third quarter of 2018. The prefunding will consist of both deposit and wholesale funding. So overall, we continue to execute our funding strategy and feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.", "Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 15.8% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17% on a fully phased-in basis last year around 120 basis point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth.", "Total liquidity was $21.1 billion, which is equal to 22% of our total assets. This is down from 22.5% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put as well above the required LCR levels.", "During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased $430 million of common stock during the fourth quarter. We have a little over $600 million remaining in share repurchases of the $1.64 billion our Board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2018.", "We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "Next on Slide 11, I\u2019ll recap our 2017 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables. Our growth of 7% was in line with our outlook range of 7% to 9%. The growth in 2017 continued to be driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth.", "Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth, as well as win new programs. Moderately tempering some of the growth was the impact from the underwriting refinements we began to implement in the second-half of 2016 and continued in 2017.", "Net interest margin was 16.35% for the year, which is better than the original range of 15.75% to 16% we provided back in January. Higher receivables yield from higher revolve and benchmark rates, a more optimal asset and funding mix along with some benefit from a lower than expected deposit rate data were the major drivers for the outperformance.", "RSAs as a percent of average receivables came in substantially lower than our outlook last January. RSAs came in at 3.9% versus the outlook of 4.4% to 4.5%, mainly driven by the sharing of higher provision expense, partly offset by program performance. This demonstrates the countercyclical nature of the RSAs.", "Our net charge-off rate of 5.37% was largely in line with our revised outlook in the low 5% range. Net charge-offs continued to normalize off the very favorable levels in 2015 and 2016 and we expect this to continue into next year, which I will discuss in our outlook.", "The efficiency ratio for the year was 30.3%, significantly lower than the outlook of around 32%. We continue to drive strong operating leverage through higher margins, revenue growth and increased productivity, which all led to the outperformance. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.3%, excluding the impact of the Tax Act. The higher margin and operating leverage were offset by higher provision expense. The higher provision expense was partially offset to the RSAs.", "Moving to our 2018 outlook on Slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2018 assume the Fed continues to tighten this year and the unemployment rate is mainly stable. We are providing a view without the impact of onboarding the PayPal Credit portfolio, as well as an outlook including the portfolio.", "We expect to close in the third quarter of 2018 and assume a closing date of July 1, 2018 for purposes of the outlook. Our outlook for receivables growth without PayPal is in the 5% to 7% range. The slightly lower growth rate takes into account underwriting refinements and assumes economic trends continue. We expect to grow sales volume at two to three times broader retail sales and for e-commerce to continue with strong growth.", "We expect the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio to drive the growth rate in the 13% to 15% range in the second-half of 2018. We believe our margin before the PayPal portfolio impact would continue to run in the 16.25% range next year. But prefunding the portfolio will have a dilutive effect on the margin, as the funding is held in short-term liquid assets until the portfolio is onboarded.", "We believe this may push the margin down closer to 16%, and depending on the timing and magnitude of the prefunding may push the margin into the 15.75% to 16% range for the full-year of 2018. We expect that RSAs as a percent of average receivables will trend back into the 4.2% to 4.4% range for 2018.", "This is higher than the 3.9% for 2017 and reflects continued strong performance of our programs, somewhat higher loyalty program expenses and moderating reserve build expectations. The expansion of the PayPal program in the second-half of 2018 will not impact the expected range.", "In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs for 2018 will be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range, driven by continued normalization and slightly lower receivables growth. While the timing of the PayPal portfolio addition given its size will impact the NCO rates in the second-half, we expect to end in a similar range for the full-year.", "Looking at seasonality and net charge-offs. We typically see the NCO rate trend higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, due to the seasonal decline in receivables. While the increase has been in the 50 to 70 basis point range over the past two years, we are expecting a more modest increase as normalization moderates and closer to what we have seen historically.", "Regarding loan loss reserves builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth-driven, given our expectation that credit normalization trends will continue to moderate. The addition of the PayPal portfolio will add to the reserve builds in the second-half of this year.", "We will need to establish a reserve for the portfolio under our reserving methodology and we anticipate a substantial portion of the reserve will be established by year-end 2018. Given the size of the portfolio, this will substantially add to our overall reserve build in the back-half of 2018. This is the main driver of the EPS solution we expect in the second-half of the year after we acquire the portfolio.", "For the first quarter, we expect the reserve build to be in the $200 million to $225 million range similar to the fourth quarter and down from the prior run rate, driven by moderating credit normalization trends.", "Moving to the efficiency ratio. For 2018, we expect to continue to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately 31% similar to 2017. This would not change with the impact of adding the PayPal portfolio. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, whoever this will be partly offset by continued spend on strategic investments we feel are important to the business.", "Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry and we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward, as we expect the business to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long-term.", "Finally, we expect to generate a return on assets of around 2.5% in 2018, including the impact of lower corporate taxes and the estimated dilution from the PayPal transaction. Given the lower corporate tax rates passed in the Tax Act, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 25% range going forward. This includes both federal and state taxes.", "Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2018. We are planning to follow a very similar process as before. We will use the Fed scenarios and assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that will review with our Board and our regulators in April, and hope to be in a position to announce our capital plans on a similar timeline as we did last year.", "While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, we would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks, in addition to supporting our growth and program acquisitions.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret.", "Margaret Keane", "Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll close with a recap of our strategic priorities that we continue to focus on to drive value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders. A top priority is to continue to execute across our three sales platforms: building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and digital and mobile technology. We expect to continue to drive organic growth and we\u2019ll evaluate potential new programs with appropriate risk adjusted returns.", "We will make investments necessary to expand the utility of our card and work with our partners to deliver innovative ideas and attractive value propositions to drive card usage. We will continue to invest in next-generation data, analytics and technology offerings and leverage SKU in category level data to help drive an even higher level of engagement with our customers.", "Digital and mobile technologies will also remain a top investment priority as the market moves more to these channels, as well as investing in the talent to help develop and drive these capabilities.", "Our banking platform remains an important funding source, and as such, we will continue to broaden our products and capabilities. We will also continue to explore new opportunities to leverage our expertise and product offerings in areas where we may not have traditionally had meaningful penetration, such as the travel and entertainment space. It remains paramount that we operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile.", "We have proven our ability to do this and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit rating and regulatory targets.", "Finally, we will continue to leverage our strong capital position. Our capital priorities are first and foremost organic growth and program acquisitions. Second, capital return to dividends and share repurchases. And lastly, M&A that helps us enhance our capabilities to support growth.", "Synchrony continues to be well-positioned for long-term growth, and we look forward to driving further value for our partners, cardholders and shareholders in 2018.", "Greg Ketron", "Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Thank you. Good morning. Brian, maybe first question on the credit quality and the performance in recent vintages. When I look at the charge-off rates for 2018, those seem to be trending a little bit softer than what you guys had initially talked about in terms of a range. Could you just reconcile that with the fact that you\u2019re seeing the \u2013 the later stage vintages, recent vintages trend better?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure, Sanjay. So, look, we generally say that credit is trending exactly in line with our expectations. We gave you an outlook of 5.5% to 5.8% for 2018. Based on all of the trends that we\u2019re seeing, the pace of normalization will flow and will moderate as we move through the year very consistent with our prior view.", "The only small tweak that we made was to factor in slightly lower receivables growth. So just due to some of the underwriting refinements that we made, we took down growth just slightly and that does have an impact on the rate. But when we look at the vintages, as we noted earlier, 2017 vintage performing better than 2016, it\u2019s more in line with 2015. We have seen a change in the mix on sales.", "We highlighted just in the fourth quarter that sales are down in that below 660 FICO range. But we\u2019re still seeing really good growth in the 720-plus range, sales, they were up 10%. So, again, very much in line with our expectations. The only small tweak was to moderate the growth rate a bit on the core business starting in 2018.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Okay, great. And then as far as the tax savings are concerned, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. But are you guys expecting to invest any of the tax savings? And do you expect any kind of competitive response, or activity associated with some of the savings from the industry?", "Margaret Keane", "Yes. So, Sanjay, it\u2019s Margaret. How are you? I think, the two areas where we\u2019re looking to make an investment is really on our employees and our communities. In terms of investing in the business, we actually have a lot of growth initiatives already built into our plans for those already accounted for. And I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you would add anything else.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, I\u2019d say generally, Sanjay, look, we\u2019re very focused on using this benefit in a way that drives real value for our shareholders. I think, that\u2019s our primary objective. We\u2019re able to do some things for employees, a little bit more on charitable contributions. The impact there is pretty modest, it\u2019s included in our outlook.", "And then, as Margaret said, we\u2019re always looking at where we can make additional investments in the business. But when we look at that, look, we\u2019re fully funding most of the growth initiatives today that meet our return hurdles. So anything additional there from our perspective right now would be pretty marginal.", "Sanjay Sakhrani", "Yes. Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.", "John Hecht", "Thanks very much. Good morning, guys.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning, John.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning, John.", "John Hecht", "And a high-level first question is, maybe can you give us just any update on incremental trends in the competitive market? And then any updates on any progress for upcoming notable renewals?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. So, I think that competitive environment has been pretty much the same. We expect 2018 to be the same as 2017. I think, probably for us what we\u2019re very focused on is our renewals. I can\u2019t comment on any particular one. But what I would tell you is that, our teams are well entrenched in our partners and working every single day to work on those renewals and working hard to really focus on what our partners need.", "So, we feel pretty good about the pipeline. We felt pretty good about the competitive environment, and we\u2019re investing to make sure we\u2019re meeting our partners\u2019 needs, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on.", "John Hecht", "Okay, thanks for that. And then, Margaret, do you have any of the digital stats that \u2013 you\u2019ve given these historically the e-commerce composition and the growth in that segment?", "Margaret Keane", "Sure. Sure, so I would say that online sales were up 15% year-over-year and that growth is in line with where the industry is now, which is about 15%. I would say, one of the real positive is, we continue to see some really good sales penetration in our retail card business, which was up 26%, 1.5% over the prior quarter. So we continue to stay very focused on this and driving volume through the mobile and digital channels.", "John Hecht", "Great. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great, thanks. Brian, I was kind of intrigued by the disparity between the growth at the higher-end of the FICO band and the lower-end. Just maybe could you talk a little bit of how long that persists? I mean, is that several quarters, or is it longer than that? And when can that that effect of the lower FICO band kind of \u2013 will that go away?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, Moshe, look, it\u2019s a good question. I think, we would clearly expect that to moderate as we head into 2018. What you\u2019re seeing really and you saw a little bit of it in the third quarter and the fourth quarter is really the cumulative impact of those underwriting refinements that we made starting in the second-half of 2016. So you\u2019re starting to see that come to the books.", "So when you look at \u2013 and I should just comment that, we\u2019re still booking plenty of sales between 600 and 660 FICO. That\u2019s still a great segment for us. We\u2019re still booking profitable volume at attractive returns there. It\u2019s just when you compare it to what we were doing a year ago, it\u2019s down.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Right.", "Brian Doubles", "Slightly. So I would think about it continuing for a couple of more quarters, hard to predict exactly. We\u2019re constantly going in and making these refinements based on where we\u2019re seeing the returns and where we\u2019re seeing the profitability.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Got it. Just as a follow-up question. The PayPal\u2019s dilutive to your returns in 2018, could you talk a little bit about what that would mean, as it goes forward past that both from the standpoint of what you might see in terms of its impact on the company\u2019s growth and returns?", "Brian Doubles", "Look, it\u2019s obviously a great growth opportunity for us. We cannot be more excited about the program and the expanded partnership with PayPal. I think, in terms of how to think about it going forward, we\u2019ve been very clear on 2018 what the impact is at PayPal.", "As you move into 2019, it\u2019s definitely accretive from an EPS standpoint. Longer-term, the return is in line with the overall return of the business. So we really like the program. We really like the returns. It\u2019s got a very resilient earnings profile through multiple scenarios, which is something obviously that we look for when launching a new program or expanding a partnership. So we\u2019re\u2026", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Great.", "Brian Doubles", "Like I said, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about it.", "Moshe Orenbuch", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you. Good morning. Brian, we saw the year-over-year change in your delinquency rate slow last November for the first time in 2017, and then held there again in December, we saw this morning. Is it reasonable to expect that that downward trajectory that we\u2019re now seeing is going to continuous we look ahead. And ultimately, does that translate into less reserve building in 2018 versus 2017 and also less reserve building in 2019 versus 2018 x PayPal and assuming that their current environment \u2013 macro that \u2013 environment that we\u2019re in persist?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure, Bill. Look, great question. I think, as you pointed out, the delinquency trends did begin to moderate this quarter. So, last quarter \u2013 or I guess, third quarter year-over-year, they were up 54 basis points. We saw that come down to 35 basis point increase in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So that was in line with our expectations. It\u2019s obviously driven by some of the tightening that we\u2019ve done.", "We would expect that trend to continue. That\u2019s part of what you saw in the reserve build coming in better than our expectations here in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve given you a view of what we think reserves look like in the first quarter. Clearly, for the year, we expect the reserve builds to moderate and return to being more growth-driven than they were certainly in 2017. So again, the outlook, very consistent both on credit and reserve builds to where we thought it would be earlier in the year.", "Bill Carcache", "So perhaps just to extend that thought process a little bit, I guess, by definition, moving to a more growth-driven from previously having not only being growth-driven, but also normalization and seasoning-driven, that effectively would mean a lower reserve build in 2018 versus 2017, is that thought process reasonable?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, that\u2019s reasonable. I mean, if you just go back to 2017, our reserve builds for the first three quarters were in that $300 million to $350 million range per quarter. That\u2019s come down now to the $213 million in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re giving an outlook for the first quarter of $200 million to $225 million, so similar to the fourth quarter.", "And if you just kind of run that out, again, excluding PayPal, right, the core reserve builds, the expectation would be, they would moderate and be lower in 2018 compared to 2017. Then obviously, the addition of PayPal will significantly add to the reserve builds in the second-half. So the best way to think about PayPal is, we\u2019re bringing on the portfolio most likely in the third quarter and we\u2019re starting with a reserve of zero.", "So effectively, over, call it, roughly nine months, maybe 12 months, we\u2019re going to build a full reserve under our existing methodology. So think about 14 to 15 months for a loss coverage on that and we\u2019re going to build it over nine to 12 months. So a lot of that is going to come in, in the second-half of the year, and that\u2019s really the driver of the $0.20 of dilution that we indicated back in November on PayPal really driven by that allowance build.", "Bill Carcache", "That\u2019s great. Brian, thank you. If I may quickly on my follow-up on NIM. I wanted to ask, perhaps just if you could clarify the NIM compression. Isn\u2019t that more optical than anything else in the sense that it\u2019s driven by the liquidity build associated with kind of prefunding? And so, there really is no kind of negative or adverse NII impact from the liquidity that you\u2019re bringing?", "Brian Doubles", "That\u2019s a good way to think about it. So, the core net interest margin is very stable around that 16.25% range, very consistent with the 2017 rate. So core NIM is stable. And then as you start to include the impact of prefunding PayPal, that does bring the margin down a bit that funding that we\u2019re going to bring on here in the first-half, we hold out in short-term assets until the portfolio is brought on the book.", "So you\u2019ve got a combination of some negative carry on that funding. You\u2019ve also got the impact from the larger denominator on the NIM rate. So you\u2019ll probably see the largest impact in the second quarter before you bring the portfolio on. So I would think about NIM adjusted for PayPal closer to 16%, it could dip a little below that depending on the timing and the magnitude of the prefunding. That\u2019s why we gave you a little bit of a conservative range 15.75% to 16%. It was really driven by the timing and the magnitude of that funding is a little bit unknown at this point.", "Bill Carcache", "Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "But again, I think, importantly, core net interest margin, very stable.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.", "Ryan Nash", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning, Ryan.", "Ryan Nash", "Brian, maybe if I can ask about the RSA, so came in at 3.88% well below the original guidance, and now we\u2019re talking about getting back to kind of 4.3% in the middle \u2013 midpoint of the range. I guess, given that, it seems like a lot is also shifting to the loyalty line at this point. Can you just maybe talk about the interplay of the two and how we get back from this 3.88% to something in the 4.2% to 4.4% range? And can you just maybe talk about are the RSAs impacted at all by tax reform, or all the programs based on pre-tax profitability?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure, Ryan. There\u2019s a lot in there, so bring me back if I miss something. I think, in terms of the RSA, the best way to think about it is to go back to our original outlook for 2017, which was 4.4% to 4.5%, okay, 4.4% to 4.5% for the year. That that\u2019s what I would consider more of a historical norm on the RSAs.", "Now, as you pointed out, we ended the year at 3.9%, right? And that was due primarily to the retailers sharing in that incremental provision expense that we had, as well as additional loyalty program expense, okay? So those two items more than offset the increase in sharing from higher margins and we also had better operating leverage year-over-year.", "So, look, I think, that\u2019s obviously a good thing. That highlights one of the natural offsets to credit normalization for our business. So now as you start to think about 2018, we expect the RSAs to be in that 4.2% to 4.4% range. That reflects both the combination of strong program performance. We also expect the reserve build, as I mentioned earlier, to moderate as we move through the year.", "So just the construct of lower reserve builds, obviously, our partners will benefit from that. That increases the RSA payments and it puts us closer to that historical range. It doesn\u2019t put us all the way back, but we think somewhere in the 4.2% to 4.4% range.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Now if I could just ask a follow-up. Just in terms of the credit guidance, the 5.5% to 5.8%, given that, consumers are obviously going to get a benefit from tax reform. Can you talk about is there anything baked into your guidance in terms of improving credit from customers having more money in their pocket?", "And I guess, just related to that, given the lower core growth that you\u2019re going to be experiencing in the 5% to 7% relative to last year, I think, last quarter you had said something around $170 million or so for reserving for growth. Is that still the right number? Is it lower now, given the fact that growth is a little bit slower? Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. Sure, Ryan. So there\u2019s nothing in the outlook for a better economy or consumers benefiting from personal tax reform. Obviously, lower personal tax rate should provide more discretionary income to the consumer. We would expect to benefit somewhat either through increased sales or on the credit side. But like it\u2019s really too early to speculate on either of those, we haven\u2019t baked anything into the forecast. So I think, look, there\u2019s some reason potentially to be optimistic there. We didn\u2019t include anything. So I think, it\u2019s still a little bit early to tell.", "And then your other question was on?", "Ryan Nash", "The absolute level of growth reserve build, given slower growth?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, look, I think that drove a little bit of the build in the fourth quarter being a little bit better than our expectations. Going forward, that\u2019s included in our outlook that reserve build will moderate and come down slightly. But the best way to think about the reserve builds in 2018 compared to 2017 is credit normalization leveling off.", "We will continue to book reserves for growth. We\u2019re not going to give you a split. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to estimate out beyond really the first quarter. But I think the important thing is that, we\u2019ve included an outlook that as credit normalization is going to level off, you\u2019ll see that in the reserve build. The reserve build will become more growth-driven and that\u2019s all in line with our earlier outlook.", "Ryan Nash", "Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.", "Mark DeVries", "Yes, thanks. My question mainly has to do with how conservative you feel this new charge-off guidance is. I mean, you guys I think have been I know that every other guidance item have been overly conservative. But on this one, you\u2019ve had to make \u2013 in charge-offs, you\u2019ve had to make revisions in the past. Just interested to get your perspective on when you set this new guidance for 2018, where you kind of mindful of setting at a level where you\u2019re pretty confident, you\u2019re going to be within that, if not below that range?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, look, Mark, I \u2013 we tend to give you \u2013 we try to give you our best view of what we think 2018 is going to look like. Some things typically perform a little bit better. Some things come in a little bit worse. And we think, if you go back to 2017, we showed you how we performed against all the key metrics. And you also have natural offsets in the business, I think, you need to take into account.", "So if you just kind of walk through the 2017 performance, we saw more credit normalization than we thought we would back in January of last year, and the offset to that is lower RSAs and better margins and you get back to a very strong return. And so I think, I \u2013 with the exception of maybe margins, where given the timing of the prefunding that can drive a difference in the rate, I wouldn\u2019t call the guidance conservative. I think, the outlook is our best view. And look, we\u2019re obviously all focused on trying to beat those metrics where we can.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay, fair enough. And then just on the prefunding, is there anything you can do or considering to push that out a bit. So that you\u2019re not carrying too much cash on balance sheet well in advance of getting those receivables?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, look, I would say, we are acutely aware of how expensive that prefunding is, and we are going to try and manage it as best we can. This is a very large asset that we\u2019re going to bring on here in the third quarter. We\u2019re going to be in regular dialogue with PayPal on timing. And when we expect to close and we\u2019re not going to bring a $1 of funding on that we don\u2019t have to.", "Mark DeVries", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.", "Rick Shane", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. There\u2019s an interesting relationship that\u2019s developing between spend growth and loan growth and the gap has widened. Brian, you or Margaret you\u2019ve actually given some very good metrics on the differentiation between the 660 spend above and below. I\u2019m a little bit surprised to see the gap loan growth widen to spend as you have less concentration from the 660 borrowers, line limits for the higher FICO borrowers?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. So, yes, I mean the best way to think about this is that, when you\u2019re making underwriting refinements and tightening a bit like we have been, you\u2019re going to see that materialize first in your sales, right? So that\u2019s where you\u2019re starting to see that you saw in the third quarter, you see in the fourth quarter. And then the other underlying dynamic credit normalization is, you tend to pick up more revolve on the overall portfolio, right, where back-end 2014, 2015 and 2016, we saw kind of an acceleration in deleveraging that\u2019s come back a bit.", "And so you see more revolve on the overall portfolio, which is offsetting that decline in purchase volume. Obviously over time, after \u2013 again, the cumulative impacts of some of these \u2013 some of the tightening that we\u2019ve done, you\u2019re going to see that result in somewhat lower receivables growth, which is really what you\u2019re seeing in our outlook in that 5% to 7% range. So at some point that purchase volume will materialize and those two line up more closely. Does that make sense?", "Rick Shane", "Yes, it does. And obviously, the retail partners really value the liquidity that you provide to their costumers. Are you getting any pushback if you tweak the underwriting and make less credit available to those sub-660 borrowers?", "Margaret Keane", "I think, our partners are very cognizant of the fact that they don\u2019t want to put credit in hands of people that can handle it. And we work very closely with them in many cases, almost all cases, their names are on the cards. So we work very closely with them and we are not getting any pushback on credit. They work closely with us and again, we all want to be responsible here, including our partners.", "Brian Doubles", "And again, this is \u2013 these are modest refinements. These aren\u2019t wholesale changes to our underwriting strategy. You\u2019re seeing a bit of the cumulative effect on sales, but we\u2019re not changing the overall risk profile of the portfolio.", "Rick Shane", "Got it. Great. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.", "Betsy Graseck", "Hi, good morning.", "Margaret Keane", "Good morning.", "Brian Doubles", "Good morning.", "Betsy Graseck", "Just a question on the net charge-off rate with the 5.50% to 5.80% guidance for next year with and without PayPal. I\u2019m just wondering, if there\u2019s a \u2013 without PayPal, are you thinking that it\u2019s more in the lower-end of the range and with it\u2019s towards the higher-end of the range. I\u2019m just wondering, because PayPal\u2019s credit quality, at least, as they\u2019ve been underwriting it, is a bit riskier than what you\u2019ve been underwriting. So I\u2019m kind of struck by the fact that you\u2019ve got the same numbers for both scenarios?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, Betsy. So, look, I think, PayPal might move us around within the range. We don\u2019t think it changes the range for the full-year. I think, it\u2019s a good question. Just given the PayPal portfolio does run at a higher loss rate than our portfolio in the aggregate. As you start to think about 2019 and beyond, we do expect there would be some upward bias on the rate as we move through 2019 and beyond that. But it\u2019s a little hard to be specific that far out.", "Betsy Graseck", "And do you anticipate running the portfolio from a credit perspective the same way they\u2019ve run it, or do you expect to run that piece of the portfolio in line with how you\u2019ve been running the rest of your book?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. So, well, first, I would just say, we\u2019re very comfortable with the risk profile of the PayPal portfolio. At this point, we don\u2019t anticipate any significant changes in the way that it\u2019s being underwritten today. We\u2019re obviously going to leverage our underwriting analytics and our process. But we\u2019re also going to utilize PayPal scores and some of their techniques. They\u2019ve got a lot of really great transactional data that we can leverage.", "So when you combine what they\u2019re doing today with some of our proprietary underwriting techniques and some of our models, I think, we can get even more sophisticated around how we manage the portfolio together. So\u2026", "Betsy Graseck", "Is that something that\u2019s walled\u2026?", "Brian Doubles", "No, go ahead.", "Betsy Graseck", "Is that walled off to PayPal like can you utilize what you learn from that and with others or that\u2019s walled off to that relationship?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes. No, we \u2013 it\u2019s very customized by program. So we don\u2019t air across programs, it\u2019s very proprietary and customized for the individual programs. So what I would say on PayPal, look, we ultimately control underwriting, but we\u2019re going to leverage the data, the tools, the expertise of both companies to make the best underwriting decisions we can.", "Betsy Graseck", "Okay. Thanks.", "Brian Doubles", "Thanks.", "Greg Ketron", "So we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question will come from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.", "Ashish Sabadra", "Thanks. Just maybe a quick clarification, the efficiency ratio of 31% that you\u2019ve guided to, that does include any kind of reinvestments from the tax benefit that you\u2019re going to get, is that right?", "Brian Doubles", "That\u2019s correct.", "Ashish Sabadra", "Okay. Was there any kind of a noise from the hurricanes in the quarter? And if there was, can you help quantify that? And just maybe the second part to that would be, any comments on the recovery trends? How those been trending? And how do you think about recovery going forward?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, sure. So, on the hurricanes back in October, I think, we disclosed that hurricane impact would put us towards the higher-end of the net charge-off rate. Yes, I wouldn\u2019t highlight really anything other than that. And then on recoveries, nothing really in the quarter, recovery pricing was pretty stable.", "Ashish Sabadra", "Okay. And maybe if I \u2013 on the hurricanes if I can just ask a follow-up like, as you go forward, what are your expectations, because that hurricane effect should really come off. So should we see better like underlying trends continue, but that hurricane negative impact come off?", "Brian Doubles", "Yes, I wouldn\u2019t think about it is being material going forward.", "Ashish Sabadra", "Okay, thanks. Thank you.", "Brian Doubles", "Sure.", "Greg Ketron", "Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on a conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. So we hope you have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you.
