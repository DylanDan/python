", "We're reiterating our guidance of 207 and remain firmly on track with achieving our 2019 transformation goals.", "Today I want to first talk you about our recent anniversary celebrations, then I will discuss two of our four key growth drivers, which influenced our daily decision making including unrivalled culture and talent and distinctive relevant easy brands. And then David will follow up with both restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. ", "Now to begin our recent anniversary celebrations. Two days ago, we celebrated our anniversary since the spinoff of Yum China as independent company and David and will fortunate to up to be in the China last week to celebrate and talk about our future together.", "We're proud of the Yum China success and impressed by their ability to make Yum, Yum's brand distinctive relevant and easy. Our collaboration with Yum China is strong as ever and we\u2019re confident in the power of our brands by working together. In connection with the spinoff we announced our multiyear strategic transformational initiatives to become more focused, more franchise and more efficient so we can deliver more growth to our shareholders. We're making significant strides towards completion of these initiatives and look forward to updating you today and as we progress on this journey. ", "Another reason anniversary occurred last month when we celebrated our 20th anniversary as an independent company, since the October 1997 spinoff from PepsiCo Yum brands has more than doubled its system sales, growing operating profit more than six times over and developed into a global power house, selling from 30% of restaurant outside the U.S. to nearly 60% of restaurants outside the U.S. A $10,000 investment in Yum brands in 1997 at the time of spin-off from PepsiCo would be worth $170,000 today, a phenomenal return. ", "A lot of change has occurred in 20 years and really even in the last year but the one constant has been our unrivalled culture and talents. When David Novak began leaving this company, he truly believe that culture mattered and it could be a distinct competitive advantage. And I'm proud to say to our people first culture has never been stronger and is a competitive advantage for Yum. ", "As I traveled to some of the 137 countries where Yum is represented, I'm able to witness the first hand the caliber of our people around the world. I take a lot of pride in knowing that our people first culture drives the passion for our brands that each of our employees and partners display. As they are truly engaged in delivering their unit piece of Yum. As we celebrate these first and 28th anniversary, I'm committed to ensuring that our under rival culture and talent remains an advantage for Yum today and I the future. ", "Now to our three distinctive, relevant and easy brands. First KFC representing nearly 50% of the operating profit. During the quarter system sales grew 7% with 4% same store sales growth and 4% net unit growth. At our recent analyst day, we highlighted the brand, strong track record of success and the significant room for growth in both developed and emerging markets. We also highlighted delivery as a future, driver of future results we're we expected double delivery sales to at least 2 billion by 2020. KFC product is ideal for delivery and market share an enthusiasm for executing it. That\u2019s why our KFC teams attended the delivery summit where Yum! China shared key learnings from their extensive delivery network including best practices to ensure this becomes a successful repeatable model for KFC around the globe. ", "The need to ease is making delivery the largest growth drivers for KFC and the team came home with several actions items to not only accelerate the growth of the delivery business at KFC but to make sure the experience is best-in-class.", "As another example of best practice sharing, approximately 300 KFC individuals from around the world including franchises, came together to share ideas on value, delivery and innovation at our annual marketing planning meeting this quarter. ", "That the teams came hungry to learn from their counterparts across the globe as the types of 12 food innovations and left the meeting confident that KFC has a very strong global pipeline of innovation routed in insights and culture. Taking place for over a decade now this is the original repeatable model. ", "As I mentioned earlier the entire global leadership team and I've been as weak in China where we all came away impress with the China team's ability to make our brands distinctive relevant and easy. And KFC China is executing on digital, social and delivery. ", "We even had KFC delivered to us on the train by placing our orders via mobile, with the team member delivering it to us at the next stop when we arrived. It really doesn\u2019t get much easier than that. Yum! China has truly traded in all access brand. In vision to China, another market demonstrating their power distinctive relevant and easy brands is Latin America, our year-to-date same-store sales growth has grown 5% and third quarter same-store sales growth 4%. ", "Using our always original brands positioning, the team has grown the call with buckets and box meals as well as driven innovations through the launch of flavored chicken on the bone and our marriage of chicken and pizza into the Chikzaa. ", "Thailand has turned around their business this quarter with 4% same-store sales growth by adding more value to the calendar and communicating in a way that really connects with consumers. As an example, the chicken and share for TBH99 or approximately $3 offers value in the snacking category and is positioned as TBH20 or $0.60 per person. KFC is truly a global powerhouse brand with China, Latin America and Thailand being the three examples of our markets demonstrating success with our always original brand positioning, value and delivery. ", "Next the Pizza Hut, currently representing 20% of Yum!'s annual operating profit split nearly even between the U.S. and international. During the quarter Pizza Hut U.S. system sales declined 1% with flat same-store sales growth and 2% net unit decline. ", "At our recent Analyst Day, we demonstrated the changes underway as a result of the transformation agreement signed in the U.S. at beginning of May. Mainly a hot, fast and reliable Pizza Hut experience. Most importantly, the transformation agreement represents clear alignment amongst the system for a digital delivery centric way forward. ", "We are making our investment in hot in a 360-degree way. When you see our ads on TV they highlight our commitment to delivering our Pizza 15 degrees hotter. When the pizza arrived at your house it's wrap in a new delivery [couch] with three layers of thermal installation. When you bite into the pizza it will be crispier as a result of our new proprietary sheet included inside every box. Each of these changes are designed to deliver on our commitment to hot. These changes were rolled out to all Pizza Huts across the U.S. just after the end of the third quarter and will be part of your next Pizza Hut experience. ", "To deliver on our fast and reliable commitment, Pizza Hut announced the addition of 14,000 new delivery drivers by the end of the year and has executed other operational enhancements design to make the delivery system more efficient. Additionally, the Hut Rewards Loyalty Program was launched in August, we're encouraged by initial trends and are confident our investment in loyalty will pay off in the long run. ", "As we said before we do not expect the transformation agreement to yield results over night but we do expect to see improvement over time. I'm confident that the changes made with the transformation agreement will allows us to execute on our commitment to a hot, fast and reliable Pizza Hut experience over the long-term. ", "Internationally Pizza Hut system sales grew 7% with same store sales worth of 2% and net unit growth of 6%. At the analyst day we highlighted the growth potential of this business through unit growth and repeatable models including technology ventures. ", "India was a standout market for Pizza Hut with its fifth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth. They have implemented the repeatable model for perfect pan pizza execution, the market also has renewed its focus on team member training, ensuring team member have the tools necessary to deliver an exceptional customer experience. As a result of these changes, customer satisfaction scores have improved over 9 percentage points versus the prior year. The team now has signed development agreements with our franchisees in India and I recently met with these franchisees and can feel there is enthusiasm for the brand. They are great examples of franchises to exhibit the three C's, capable, capitalized, committed; committed both to our brand and to our culture. ", "With the perfect pan pizza team members are ready for action and the right partners in place, India is poised to accelerate its growth and we look forward to seeing the continued success in this market. ", "Finally, Taco Bell, which represents approximately 30% of Yum!'s operating profit, by keeping to the core of Mexican inspired product with value and innovation Taco Bell delivered another solid quarter. This quarter system sales grew 6% with same store sales growth of 3% and net unit growth by 3%. ", "During the quarter busy potato read out combined the powers of crispy potato bytes, season baked, cheddar cheese, nacho cheese sauce and a kick of creamy chipotle sauce all for just $1. This showcases Taco Bell's ability to deliver innovative products at an attractive value to the consumer. And the Double Chalupa, which included a double amount of seasoned beef, built on familiar cravable [ph] product while still delivering strong value in a $5 box. ", "Now proven they are more than just food is fuel, the colder Taco Bell delivered on food as an experience by launching their own line of clothing and partnership with Forever 21, including crop sweat shirts, shirts, body suits and jackets. ", "Taco Bell's first ever retail collaboration is inspired the iconic graphics that each brand is known for with a mix of vibrant prints. We understand the importance of reaching the consumer beyond the food and top of our given their fans another reason to celebrate. ", "Internationally Taco Bell opens 15 new stores this quarter, Brazil continue to strong develop and has now open 17 stores over the past 12 months. I've mentioned before continue to unlock the business model by driving cost out of the supply chain and building scale with new and existing franchises. ", "And India the great example of this, where we're now locally sourcing corn and equipments which significantly improved their margin. India and Brazil our two Taco Bell's four key growth market along with China and Canada. We continue to be excited about the potential for this brand internationally and changes to the supply chain such as those made in India will make the brand sustainable internationally over that long-term. ", "In summary the focus on our four key growth drivers has delivered out strong third quarter results, building off a solid first half for the year, we remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and are confident in reiterating our 2017 guidance and transformation targets. ", "And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and CFO, David Gibbs.", "David Gibbs ", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our third quarter results and full year outlook an update on our transformation initiative and how we are bringing two of our four key growth drivers to life, our bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. ", "Yum! delivered another successful quarter with 11% core operating profit growth and 22% EPS growth excluding Special Items. During the quarter, the was minimal impact to operating profit from the timing difference between refranchises and the associated G&A savings referred to you as the net impact from refranchising dilution. Additionally, during the quarter, we spent approximately $10 million on incremental advertising at Pizza Hut as part of the transformation agreement. This was included in Pizza Hut operating profit. ", "We are reiterating our 2017 full-year guidance of mid-single digit core operating profit growth. As a reminder this was derived from underlying based operating profit growth of high-single digits adjusted for the 53rd week and the net impact from refranchising dilution. ", "We cautioned that the timing of the refranchising impact would be hard to predict. While we had limited net impact from refranchising dilution in the first quarters of the year, we expect this to be a significant headwind in the fourth quarter which is consistent with the 10 to 12 percentage points headwinds discussed during our second quarter earnings call. In addition, we expect 15 million of incremental Pizza Hut media investment in the fourth quarter or an additional 3 percentage points of headwind. ", "Now with regards to our transformation initiative, we remain on track to deliver all aspects of our multiyear strategy of being more focused, more franchised and more efficient to deliver more growth. ", "First more focus. This quarter was our second consecutive quarter of delivering 6% system sales growth, on our way to a bold goal of 7% system sales growth. ", "Second, more franchise. This quarter we refranchised 209 units including 72 KFCs, 46 Pizza Huts and 91 Taco Bells, increasing to 95% franchise ownership. We continue to expect the majority of the refranchising to be completed in 2017 with the remainder to reach at least 98% franchise and less than 1,000 company owned restaurants to be complete by year-end 2018. ", "Third more efficient. We continue to make progress towards our G&A goal of 1.7% of system sales excluding special items. Year-to-date CapEx is 228 million. We now anticipate approximately 300 million to 350 million in CapEx this year slightly lower just from our previous guidance of 350 million to 400 million. ", "This will reduce in tandem with company ownership to approximately 100 million in ordinary cost of business CapEx by 2019. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter we repurchased over 19 million shares at an average price of $69.", "Our fully diluted share count as of quarter end was approximately 349 million. Combined with our quarterly dividends we have returned over 1.6 billion in 2017. We remain committed to returning between 6.5 and 7 billion to shareholders from 2017 to 2019. All of this is enabling us to deliver more growth and we remain on track to deliver at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019. ", "Moving now to old restaurant developments, one of our four key growth drivers. During the quarter we opened 641 growth new units and 362 net new units to year-over-year net unit growth of 3%. ", "Although we've not disclosed the breakdown of our long-term 7% system sales growth target between same stores sales growth and net growth, the key to achieving this over the long-term is to ensure a strong development pipeline is in place with growth minded franchises. ", "We're attaching development agreement through our refranchising deals which are way for young to accelerate unit development across all three brands. We're confident in the unit growth potential for each of our brands with continue growth at KFC and Pizza Hut in both developed and emerging markets and international development for Taco Bell really just beginning. ", "The growth minded franchisees behind our bold restaurant developments brings me to our fourth growth driver unmatched franchise operating capability. We talk about the three Cs required for our franchisees, capable, capitalized and committed. ", "As an example of finding the right franchise partners demonstrating the three Cs, this quarter we consolidated our highly fragmented franchisee base for Pizza Hut in South Korea under one master franchisee. The consolidation of this market should allow us to streamline operations, enhance our growth prospects and accelerate development in a key market for Pizza Hut.", "At KFC we recently celebrated founder's week, engaging all employees with Colonel Sanders and his passion for food. To honor the original celebrity chef, we celebrate the chef in each of our stores who hand bread, fresh chicken daily with recognition and by going back to the basics on operations, recertifying our chefs on making our world-famous products to ensure our food is served with the irresistible taste we all know and love. ", "And at Taco Bell, Greg previously mentioned the supply chain initiatives in India positively impacting restaurant margins. It is operational enhancement such as these, which improve our unit level economics, strengthen our franchise partner's health and have us enthusiastic about unlocking the potential of Taco Bell globally. ", "In conclusion we're pleased with our third quarter results, which build on a strong forecast and reinforce our confidence in the underlying strength of our business. Our strategic transformational initiatives and focus on four key growth drivers are setting us up to deliver more growth to our shareholders and we look forward to updating you as we progress on this journey. ", "And with that the team and I are happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. ", "Brian Bittner", "Two questions first, you talked about accelerating towards your refranchising goal bit more rapidly from here, I think getting a lot done by the end of this year and that contributes to some near-term earnings headwinds which you clearly alluded for 4Q and I know you're not giving '18 guidance yet, so we be assuming our models that this refranchising dynamic also remains alluded factor in the first half of '18 and then starts to reverse to accretion in the later part of '18 and into '19, any color you can give us has 4Q will be helpful.", "Greg Creed ", "Yes Brian, I think that\u2019s a good way to look at it, obviously we have a lot more refranchising to do and that will be more dilutive and that\u2019s why we highlighted the issues related to that in the fourth quarter and that will continue into the first half of the year. ", "Brian Bittner", "Okay, and second question just on Pizza Hut U.S. Is there anything you can talk to regarding the early progress there we heard a competitor yesterday putting a lot of point on inner felt for a weak start to the fourth quarter so there is a lot of confusion swirling around regarding pizza in general and I know it's really early in your turnaround efforts but any light you can shed on how that's going?", "David Gibbs ", "I think to sort of answer two parts of the question. Look we also love live sports whether it's baseball, college football, NFL. We are not seeing any impact from any of that on our business and continue to obviously promote not just pizza but all of our brands on live sports. And then on Pizza Hut as I said, this is really us putting the foundations in place, the foundations are not always sexy but I think delivering hot reliable pizza is important and I do believe the team is making progress on all the areas in the foundation that will enable us to build longer term a strong Pizza Hut position. ", "Greg Creed ", "And I don\u2019t think that and there have been no real impacts to our business from any of the issues although I would point out as Pizza Hut is the official sponsor of the NCA and so we're happy about that partnership. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. ", "John Glass ", "First, just on your system sales growth goals of 7% and two of your brands one of them are KFC you very close it Taco Bell of obviously Pizza it's lagging that 7%. So first can you get to the 7% without Pizza Hut getting 7% itself and when you think about Pizza Hut can you get to 7% at Pizza Hut if that is a goal without the U.S. without accelerating. Can you maybe just what are the dynamics on the brands and maybe just dealing in Pizza Hut? ", "Greg Creed ", "Well, I think you just saw John we\u2019re making good progress obviously we're making good progress in KFC in developing and emerging markets as you saw [Indiscernible] is also is making great progress. We are also making progress at Pizza Hut on the international side of Pizza Hut we obviously had a good quarter I think system sales were down was 7% and obviously we are going to have to make quarter-over-quarter progress but as we said don\u2019t expect any heroics, but we do believe we can if I getting the foundations in place and doing the right things continue to progress our Pizza Hut U.S. performance. So, I just feel good about the performance we are making the steady progress we are making we are making the brands more distinctive and more relevant and easier and I think all of that is going to help us get to the long-term goal.", "David Gibbs ", "Yes, I think one of the ways to look at it as we have over 250 combinations of brands and countries so some of those brands in countries are going to be growing north of 10% and other will be growing less than 7%. Do we need Pizza Hut to get to 7% to get the entire systems to 7% no. As you can see as we've said KFCs has been performing at 7% and actually KFC U.S. is closing store more stores and they are opening right now we know that's going to reverse. So, we've got upside at all three brands and I know we are going to get there in different ways in different countries but in aggregate we've got our eyes focused on the price of 7%.", "John Glass ", "And if I can just follow-up, can you or maybe you did disclose some in the release and I missed it what the refranchising dilution is expected to be in the fourth quarter just as the lot of moving pieces in that quarter. Can you isolate the refranchising piece so we can get a better sense of how we think about the first half of '18?", "Greg Creed ", "I think we've categorized that as 10 to 12 percentage points of headwinds through a combination of refranchising dilution and the impact from the 53rd week, you can do the math on it but basically we will get into more details on that in the fourth quarter and the other challenge that we have with all of this refranchising is the timing is never really certain, these are deals that we're working on without side parties and they will close when they close, we don\u2019t want to close them before they should close or any later then they should close. It was very hard to predict exactly what that will be in the fourth quarter. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse.", "Jason West", "Just wondered if you can talk a bit about the competitive environment in the U.S., I guess thinking mostly Taco Bell, another good quarter there, you guys are holding up margins pretty good and we're seeing a lot of these companies in the space having invested in margin and seeing some labor pressure, just wanted to feel for, if you think you can grow margins in Taco Bell from here or should we look for investment to try to keep the sales where they are. ", "David Gibbs ", "Its defiantly a competitive market place, I think we all know that, which I think is even more encouraging with the results we delivered, Taco Bell had a solid quarter as you say plus 3% same stores sales growth, I think what Taco Bell is able to is to balance, being the value leader with an underlying economic model that delivers good industry leading margins. I think that team knows exactly how to ensure the we continue to grow same store sales while obviously protecting the sort of 20% plus margins, I got confidence though base value and innovation we will now continue to do that in the fourth quarter and going forward. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. ", "David Palmer ", "You mentioned confidence against the 2019 earnings goals, I think there was some curiosity now, ahead of 2019 its more on, those sustaining elements of the revenue growth which of course are the unit growth and delivery. Is there anything at this point, I know it's early, I know you probably have future analyst day's ahead, you want to talk about this more but updates about particularly the U.S. when it comes to delivery and international when it comes to unit growth and the confidence you have in traction and in any numbers or, that will be helpful. Thank you. ", "David Gibbs ", "Well on the unit front, I guess I point if you look at the number this quarter, we're close to 100 hundred units ahead of our net new unit development phase from last year, that\u2019s a pretty encouraging sign and effective if you look at gross units over 200 units ahead of the pace that we had. ", "So, I think we feel like, just as we hit plans and the ramp up in unit development is happening slowly but surely and confident particularly internationally in having a lot more upside there and the U.S. off course a big opportunity on unit growth is reversing Pizza Hut U.S. and [AST] the U.S. to being net growing rather than decliners which is well on its way. ", "Greg Creed ", "I think that question on delivery, which is sort of easy part of distinct, relevant and easy, I mean the good news is we got a thousand Taco Bells delivering now obviously the KFC team as we said went off to the delivery summit with China so they picked up a lot of ideas on how to execute delivery, we go almost I think 20,000 brands with Yum! currently delivering, we got a lot of in house knowledge obviously with the pizza brand and obviously with KFC and places like the Middle East delivery. And obviously we're doing some testing work with aggregators. So, I think we're doing all the things that you would expect us to do when order to unleash the growth potential of delivery going forward. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Gregory Frankfort with Bank of America. ", "Gregory Frankfort", "Maybe following up can you talked about how you think delivery played out in the U.S. in terms of getting the check size up and maybe how you think the bundled value meals fit into that kind of longer term to drive check size?", "Greg Creed ", "Sure. I think Greg the good news is the delivery that we are doing there are two things that are obviously, check does grow. Secondly that also a lot of it is new occasions. So, I think what we are excited about delivery actually gives us greater access to newer occasions and high checks. So, both of those will obviously help to drive system sales. I think right now into early days but what we are seeing is part of a check growth and a new occasion opportunity both of those obviously positive for our growth potential. ", "Gregory Frankfort", "And maybe one follow-up just on the international business it feels like across a bunch of different brands you've seen better numbers for the last couple of quarters from some of the international divisions any thoughts on the international consumer in and particularly out of Europe?", "Greg Creed ", "When you are in that 137 countries there is a lot of international consumers. Look, I think our business in Central and Eastern Europe is strong our KFC business in the UK is strong look I think where we built distinct relevant and easy brands which is really the cornerstone of driving our system sales growth and where we've got great franchise partners who are executing a great customer experience I think that's why we are continuing to see the success and the growth that we are around the world. So, look there will always be markets when you know as many of that have good macros and bad macros our job is to build distinct relevant and easy brands supported by unmatched franchise operating capability.", "David Gibbs ", "I think we've talked about this in past occasions but couple of years ago we made a change to organize globally around brands and that change principally benefitted the international [indiscernible] because we've already have been organized that way in the U.S. so I think part of this success we are seeing in building distinctive relevant brands is really what we keep talking about just more focused on the brands and sales dedicated 100% teams to the brands internationally working even closer with our franchise partners.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe ", "The question is on KFC obviously a good quarter both from same-store sales and a unit development perspective. But you are considering that is your biggest division and it's kind of instill the drivers of the overall Yum! Engine. I just wanted to get a sense of what can accelerate from here at KFC in order to allowing the corporation to achieving 7% system wide sales growth. ", "4% global comps I think it's in the above average number for the division is obviously something that you'd be proud of at any point and accelerating unit development beyond the 4% level that you are currently achieving on a unit base of 21,000 is obviously just a tough order just by the law of large numbers. So, I just want to get your sense of which are those -- what can accelerate from here at KFC or is this just a type of division that even if you are achieving 7% system wide sales growth as we think about in the next 3 to 5 years would just in of itself be a great level?", "Greg Creed ", "Well I think the good news -- I've talk about same store sales growth I think the good thing is that Roger Eaton, is doing a great job of getting everyone focused back on the call. So, if you think about the innovation that we've been doing it's all been innovation around core chicken on the bone. So, flavors delivered by chicken on the bone value, you have got everyone running $5 boxes, $10 share and $20 family meals, I think that\u2019s helping delivering, obviously, we do believe that the KFC brand, I joke internally that the Colonel we're going to deliver and that\u2019s why he made the bucket 60 years ago, because there is better delivery vehicle then a bucket of chicken. ", "So, I think that for all of those reasons, focus on the core, flavor around the core, pride in the core and then obviously great execution plus then delivery, I think will gives us with the confidence that even through this is a big brand and yes it has a lot of big number that this brand can continue deliver like it's been delivering for the past few quarters and I remain firmly confident that this brand will continue to deliver. ", "John Ivankoe ", "So that 4% type of comp level, is something you think that this execution, delivery sounds like it's an achievable number over the long-term, what about on the restaurant side, I mean does it make sense means would you want the 21,000-unit brand to accelerate beyond 4% system wide unit growth year-on-year. ", "Greg Creed ", "Obviously, we talked but that\u2019s we're not provide brand by brand guidance on development but your question is well placed John, of course we like to see all of our brands pick up the pace of development, KFC is building a lot of units but it also describes the service and so many markets the world, I know the KFC team is continually looking for ways to accelerate development and you\u2019re seeing some of that happening this year. ", "John Ivankoe ", "And something that a lot of companies kind of experience both in a good way and a bad way as, 1000 or 2000 units globally in a year can be too much, there is two things, one is franchise capability and demand and secondly as the level that you think is right for the brand to grow in terms of units, and so I'm just trying to get a sense of what that maximum limit is, or perhaps the really is that one that as there is market to market build up that it continues to make sense to accelerate that development. ", "Greg Creed ", "I think two things, John I think as David said, in the large part of the world, we got less than one unit for million population, a large part of the world, you would argue we would be under penetrated compared to sort of develop market economics. ", "The second thing is, I think as we gone through this transformation, as we refranchise the business, we build in as we said stronger franchises, so about our existing franchise base, we\u2019re very happy with and the new franchises with development agreement attached to all of this, which traditionally we haven't done but as well as with the capability and the commitment and the capacity to actually do this development. So, I think for those reasons, we feel good about the KFC branding out to deliver both same store sales growth and net new unit growth, this year, next year the year after and the year after that. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Matthew McGinley with Evercore ISI. ", "Matthew McGinley ", "I guess I have a follow up on that unit development question, it's very obviously very encouraging to see that pick up in the unit growth but as you look at the present unit growth that you had over the past, through this quarter or past quarter do you know how much of that is normal development growth pipeline versus the contractual commitments you're receiving from refranchising or the contractual commitment that you get from when a franchisee turns over and curious of the, uptake that we're seeing now is could accelerate because we're not actually getting those refranchising type commitments and the numbers yet. ", "Greg Creed ", "I think it's fair to say that some of the refranchising commitments have started to impact the pace of development but remember with the time frames around development and when we just really restarted this batch of refranchising little bit over a year ago a lot of these deals were in the pipeline before the refranchising began so it's starting to have an impact and then we hope that it will continue to avenue impact of even greater magnitude as we go forward. ", "Matthew McGinley ", "And on a G&A decline by 300 million as it relates to the refranchising you've said that extensive would be done with that refranchising by year-end. What causes a lag between refranchising and G&A reductions as your asset based trends. I mean you has the due to store related G&A I mean you have the headquarters G&A kind of curious of how the perhaps the headquarters G&A would lag or lead that refranchising that would drop those G&A dollars?", "Greg Creed ", "I guess also to clarify we've said the majority of the refranchising would be done by year-end but we certainly will have some refranchising that will still be in 2018. And then as far as what might be a lagging item on the G&A versus the refranchising of stores just to give you like an obvious one in some international markets if we're selling the entire market we might have office lease obligations, we might have to do a lot of things with employees to continue during the transition period to a franchise owner organization all of that would be lagging the actual transfer to restaurants at a restaurants level profitability that we would going to with the franchises.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Dennis Geiger with UBS. ", "Dennis Geiger ", "Can you provide any more detail on what you are seeing from those refranchise initiatives in place at Pizza Hut in the U.S. at this early stage anything on loyalty the new thermal power, it's the new app or the marketing spend maybe if it's just customers satisfaction metrics maybe what the franchises are seeing any of the incremental detail would be great? Thanks.", "Greg Creed ", "I think it's just a nice positive build I think the good news is when QSR magazine came out and rated [indiscernible] genius category I think we were only second behind Starbucks in a sort of group with Dominos, so we feel really good that our asset is being recognized at least within the industry. ", "So, no, I think we are making progress, its early days. I know the advertising for hot pouches has just started as we said you will get to a crispier, hotter, when they next experience Pizza Hut. So, I think we are doing all the right things. Our loyalty is now underway making progress on that, we are happy with that progress. So, I think we are just starting to do all the right foundational blocking and tackling things and I'm pleased with the progress that we are making on all of those fronts.", "Dennis Geiger ", "If I can get more in with the roughly 600 restaurants refranchised year-to-date till the end of the quarter anything more you say about those transactions I guess and just specifically any commentary on the development agreements coming out of those I'm sure there is only so much you can say but as far as number of years just to think about anywhere that kind of contractualize that? Thanks.", "Greg Creed ", "Yes, I think first of all we are pleased with the prices we are getting for refranchising as I've mentioned on previous calls. There is the strong market for the stores that we are refranchising and lots of capital out there available for these kinds of deals and similarly with that capital availability we've got franchises willing to sign up for development commitments we've got generally very good unit level economics in most of the countries we operate in, so yes, I think it's been a very positive story in terms of the reception to the refranchising program.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Co. ", "Andrew Charles ", "Greg where the quick service industry increasing focus more recently on the $1 to $3 price points, it seems likely to intensify early next year, looking to talk about differentiate on value, given the brand with the only national QSR with the $1 menu over the less five years and then I have a follow up. ", "Greg Creed ", "I think as I said earlier the great thing is we can grow $1 all day, all night, all week, all month, all quarter and still have great margins. We got a really good underlying economic model at Taco Bell, we will never give up that leadership of value in the QSR category, I can assure you that, I know Brian and team are very focused, they what\u2019s going on the market place, but I think we're very confident, we execute our plans given the context of what's occurring that we can still be very competitive in that price range. ", "Andrew Charles ", "Thanks, and then David what lead to minimal profit dilution from a franchising in 3Q while you guys were ahead of schedule in the franchising activity and further what expense should we expect the franchising dilution to be most evident in 4Q and early 2018.", "David Gibbs ", "The minimal profit dilution in the first part of the year, obviously some of this depends on what kind of stores you're selling, if you're selling to stores with lower margin and you're collecting royalty in some cases, you can see a positive impact from the refranchising. In terms of where these things are going to show up in our P&L obviously you will see our margins going down brand by brand, you will see G&A going down and then franchise and license expense going up, particularly when we refranchise stores that we end up holding on to real estate or remaining on lease obligations, we have to recognize the brands and depreciation to the franchise and license expense line. ", "Operator", "Okay your final question is coming from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. ", "Sara Senatore ", "I have a quick follow up on pizza and then I wanted to ask about Latin America, the first on pizza, I was just, I know you, if I didn\u2019t see any real impact from NFL viewership, but it does seem like the category aggregate has slowed so, Greg has mentioned the idea of delivering being part of easy and I'm wondering if it\u2019s the fact that so many other restaurants are pursuing this kind of easy component through delivery, is that having any impact and then like I said I have a second question about Latin America, please. ", "Greg Creed ", "I think a lot of people are trying to get into the easy delivery business but I think we got a track record of doing it for so many years, we obviously have a system that knows how to deliver, I think what we\u2019ve done is we doubled down we hired 14,000, we'll be hiring 14,000 more drivers as we said to deliver. We have the team operationally focused on making sure that we improve of speed of service, we make the pizzas hot, you can now track it, you got a loyalty program. So even though I think, obviously competition is heating up in this area, I also think we're raising our performance and I think that will keep, continue to keep in competitive in this market place. ", "Sara Senatore ", "Okay thank you and then just on the Latin America business, you talked about it very positively and I think from those the time that I been following you and it going to be in the shadow of emerging Asia and particular. Are you seeing sort of a quantitative or qualitative difference in performance there and does that change potentially? How you think about the balance of your global growth going forward?", "Greg Creed ", "As we think we said, what I love is we've got this content of repeatable model and it's very clear that when we execute all best practice to repeatable model, it has impact, so the Latin America KFC performance I spoke about was really about implementing the repeatable model, maybe so we had value and then innovation around chicken flavored chicken on the bone. ", "We\u2019ve also got as we talked about the talk about our Brazilian business now we got 17 restaurants which we've opened in 12 months so that was a market that we were in for that brand in the past so, look I think we just feel confident that by executing the repeatable model and growing our presence with a brand like Taco Bell, we can get more growth out Latin America.", "Sara Senatore ", "Thank you.", "Greg Creed", "Okay. So, I'd like to thank everyone for being on the call today. I think we delivered another strong quarter, we are firmly on track to achieve our 2019 transformation goals. I do believe we are focused on the right key growth drivers and now for all of office about execute, execute, execute. So, thank you for being with us. Thank you for supporting us, we look forward to speaking you in the future. Thank you. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "This does conclude today's conference.

Brands 2009 first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer; please go ahead sir. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website at www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.

First coming up next we have on June 24 we will host Pizza Hut Investor Day in Dallas and will follow the next day with YRI Investor Day, Yum!

Then July 29 is KFC Investor Day in Louisville, and then August 11 is Taco Bell Investor Day in Irvine, California. Please notify us if you plan to attend these events. And then lastly our next second quarter earnings release will be on Tuesday, July 14. That\u2019s a quick update of our calendar of events coming up. ", "On our call today you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Richard Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will be happy to take your questions. Now I will turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak ", "Thank you Tim, and good morning everybody. I\u2019m very pleased to report better then expected first quarter EPS growth of 14% before special items. The power of our global portfolio allowed us to overcome a challenging environment with modest system sales growth of 4% and operating profit growth of 7% prior to foreign currency translation. ", "Importantly the momentum behind the key driver of our global business, international development, continued with a record 256 new restaurants opened outside the United States including a first quarter record of 98 new restaurants in Mainland China. ", "Additionally we generated worldwide same store sales growth of 1%, the 22nd consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth including 2% growth in Mainland China and 6% growth in Yum! Restaurants International, offsetting the decline that we had in the United States. ", "Our operators also improved our worldwide margins by more then one point from the benefit of a combination of pricing taken in the second half of last year, managing the details and productivity, and moderating commodity inflation. ", "Overall this was a strong start to what everyone knows is a difficult year. Now let me take you through our key strategies and the results of each of our divisions. ", "First let\u2019s talk about China, where we have the unique strategy to leverage our powerful team and infrastructure to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category since we\u2019re on the ground floor of this important market. ", "Overall China continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world, even as it weathers an obvious bump in the road. Importantly I think its safe to say based on our results that our Yum! China business stands on solid ground given our strong profitability, powerful new unit economics, and the strength of our leading brands. ", "For the first quarter our China division drove strong results. System sales growth was 12% prior to foreign currency translation. New unit development included 98 new openings in Mainland China, the best start to a year we\u2019ve ever had. Additionally same store sales growth was plus 2%. Importantly our restaurant margin was up 1.7 points. ", "All of this led to impressive profit growth of 21% excluding positive foreign currency translation, lapping 23% growth last year. I\u2019m proud of our China team for delivery such as strong quarter in a tough year and at the same time, continuing to make investments in our emerging brands. ", "You may remember in December that we told you that our China business was planning for a weaker first half of 2009. We expect that to continue as we lap 14% same store sales growth and 38% profit growth in the second quarter. Richard will go into more detail on these numbers later on. ", "Now let me give you a little more color on each of our China brands, KFC continues to lead the western QSR category with nearly 2,600 units today, and impressive average unit volumes of $1.4 million, which is even more impressive given the fact that the average ticket of about $4 in China is less then half that of the US level.", "We are clearly appealing to the mainstream masses in China. We continue to leverage our new incremental sales layers at KFC including breakfast, delivery, and multiple proteins. Importantly, we continue to generate high returns on our KFC new unit development with cash-on-cash paybacks of just over two years. ", "Pizza Hut Casual Dining continues to be the leader in the western casual dining category with 429 units in 107 cities and our closest competitors have less then 30 units. Pizza Hut is dialing up the dining experience through a broader menu including new entrees with beef, chicken, and shrimp, along with more and more beverages and desserts and our Chinese customers are loving the new Pizza Hut. ", "We are also building new units in more tier 3 cities. And as I said we continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service, a new category that we are building, continues to grow and we expect will add over 20 new units this year and add four new cities to our fold. ", "With [east dawning] our Chinese fast food brand we have plans to open about 10 units this year as we develop the operating platform for large scale and get our unit level economics to where they need to be. In March we also announced a new investment in Little Sheep, the leading chain in China\u2019s large high growth hot pot restaurant category. The hot pot category is a new category for us and generates an estimated nearly $1 billion of sales in China. ", "Little Sheep has seen impressive growth since it first opened its doors nine years ago and now has 375 units and a proven management team that will continue to be solely accountable for running the day-to-day operations. ", "In addition to our portfolio of leading brands, we believe we have key long-term strategic advantages in Mainland China. First, an unmatched development team which we know is the largest on the ground in Mainland China. Importantly this team has the knowhow around development in over 550 cities. We are literally across the country in China and establishing scale everywhere.", "Second we have an unparalleled distribution system which has the capability to bring food and supplies to all these areas of this very large geography that Mainland China represents. ", "Third we have developed targeted management manufacturing facilities for specific products we serve such as our proprietary egg tart dessert which is a significant part of our KFC menu mix now. And finally we have a strong and very tenured executive management team and a tremendous bench of RGMs that are ready to open new units. ", "This operating capability gives us the ability to open up great restaurants with great returns and give our customers a great experience. We believe when you combine these strategic advantages with the strength of our leading brands and the high returns that we have, we are able to have big growth opportunities ahead of us in China for the long-term. ", "There is no question clearly that Yum! is doing its part to stimulate the Chinese economy. Over the next three years we plan to invest over $1 billion in new capital in Mainland China, build 1,500 new restaurants, and add over 75,000 new jobs to the economy. ", "China continues to be the largest restaurant opportunity of the 21st century and is clearly a place that we plan on doing business for a long, long, long time. ", "Now, on the Yum! Restaurants International, which represents the balance of our international operations, where our strategy is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere. Here I would like to acknowledge that more then 700 franchisees around the world which are opening over 95% of our new units and keeping this business on track for profitable growth. ", "For the first quarter system sales grew 10% prior to foreign currency translation including same store sales growth of 6% and development of 145 new restaurants in more then 45 countries. Operating profit growth was 4% excluding foreign currency translation and was lower then our sales growth as expected, primarily due to the lap of a lost tax benefit in Mexico. I\u2019ll let Richard Carucci, our CFO, give you more details with his comments. ", "The best news for this division, was in addition to the strong new unit opening was the strong performance in YRI\u2019s two largest KFC company markets; the UK and Australia, along with our franchise in Japan. These more mature businesses generated solid same store sales growth in the first quarter and showed the resilience of the KFC brand when we\u2019re well operated even in a tough economic environment. ", "In our Yum! Restaurants International emerging markets I want to highlight the great progress our team is making in India where our KFC same store sales growth was better then 30% for the first quarter and margins substantially improved versus year ago. We are absolutely confident we are well on our way to developing proven unit economics and that will allow us to reach a scalable business model for KFC. We are also very excited about introducing Taco Bell into India later this year. ", "Finally Yum! Restaurants International is in the process of rolling out KFC\u2019s biggest global initiative to build an incremental new sales layer around its new Crushers beverage line. Crushers was launched first in Australia last year and we\u2019re expanding Crushers to more countries and more stores this year and expect them to be in about one-third of our YRI KFC system by year end. ", "Crushers is successfully bringing KFC a new base of products that will allow us to begin building a full line of contemporary beverages that can be enjoyed as snacks and desserts. ", "At Pizza Hut we are expanding value options at Yum! Restaurants International, enhancing our dining menus and varieties, and which includes the expansion of [inaudible]. Longer-term we believe that Yum! Restaurants International is the division with the greatest potential given the five billion people. We\u2019d like them to spend a billion dollars per person, but five billion people in the over 100 countries represented, where we have only three restaurants per million people compared to 60 restaurants per million in the US.", "The strength of our over 700 franchise partners and their commitment to building new units should make this our largest division one day. In fact our team is working on both goals to make YRI a $1 billion profit division in the future. ", "Next, let\u2019s talk about our US business where our strategy is to dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency of performance, and returns. Here I\u2019m proud of the profit growth our teams are generating and the long-term brand building we are doing even though we have mixed results on sales. ", "Our first quarter sales in the US were lower then expected, the same store sales declined 2% due to weakness at KFC and Pizza Hut. Importantly our margins were up due to higher guest checks and moderating commodity inflation along with productivity measures taken in the restaurants. ", "We also began to see the benefit of actions we took in late 2008 to reduce our US cost structure. Overall we were able to generate operating profit growth of 7%. Taco Bell continues to perform well in this environment even though it faces more pressure as more and more QSR sandwich chains offer $0.99 value menus. ", "You will see new Frutista frozen flavors and continued innovation around our why pay more value platform. The brand continues to be well positioned for a successful 2009 after a solid first quarter. And remember Taco Bell generates 605 of our US profits. ", "Pizza Hut performance was impacted by declining dinner sales across the industry as more consumers chose to cook at home. We expect the next couple of quarters to be challenging for Pizza Hut in the US as the consumer continues to be under pressure and in part due to the lap of the strong results of Pizza Hut generated last year. ", "Value continues to play an important role with our customers and is a challenge for us and so we\u2019re currently promoting our Panormous Pizza for $10. While we are slugging it out on sales, we are making strategic investments this year to more firmly entrench our Tuscany Pasta sales layer and nationally launch our Wing Street line of flavored chicken wings. ", "We are convinced an arsenal of pizza, pasta, and chicken will allow us to leverage our assets more fully throughout the week which we believe is critical to Pizza Hut\u2019s long-term success. The Tuscany Pasta sales layer continues to contribute a healthy mix of sales particularly in the early part of week and benefited from the added variety of lasagna. ", "On the chicken front, Wing Street continues to grow with about 150 new units this quarter and we will be on air with television in the fourth quarter with advertising where we\u2019ll be talking about the great opportunity for even more variety people can enjoy with Pizza Hut. ", "There\u2019s no question we will go into 2010 a stronger and more vibrant brand with better capability to leverage our delivery business and assets. ", "On to KFC where there\u2019s no question we underperformed this quarter and we were also impacted by weak dinner sales. Our big new initiative however is to build a new sales layer at KFC and that\u2019s with Kentucky Grilled Chicken, which was launched here in the United States. As the brand\u2019s most successfully tested product, Kentucky Grilled Chicken offers consumers a new way to enjoy the great taste of KFC and will broaden the appeal of the brand. ", "I want to comment Roger Eaton and the team for the absolutely great job they have done in rallying the system around the KFC\u2019s biggest launch of this new product. We really encourage you to come and try the unfried side of KFC and we hope you enjoy this product as much as our customers tell us they do. Its absolutely a terrific, terrific product and we\u2019re very, very proud of it. ", "So let me wrap up and put the total Yum! Brands experience into perspective and tell you how I think you should look at Yum! Brands\u2019 performance. We have clearly gotten off to a better then expected start this year, but realize its early and there is a lot of hard work yet to do. So don\u2019t get ahead of us either for the second quarter or for the full year. ", "However, I can confidently tell you that we plan to do what it takes to continue our track record of meeting our target of 10% earnings per share growth this year. Now let me turn it over to Richard to give you the financial update. ", "Richard Carucci ", "Thank you David, and good morning everyone. In this section of the call I\u2019m going to comment on three areas; our first quarter results, our outlook for the second quarter, and our approach for managing our business during the balance of 2009.", "As David mentioned first quarter results came in better then anticipated as we delivered EPS growth of 14% excluding special items. The upside versus expectation was driven primarily by strong profit performance in China, strong margins in the US, and a favorable tax rate for the quarter. ", "Please note that reported EPS declined in the first quarter. This was driven by the sale of our minority interest in KFC Japan in the first quarter of 2008, which resulted in a $0.13 per share gain. As we have stated previously EPS excluding special items is more indicative of the performance of our ongoing business. ", "Now let\u2019s dig into the first quarter results and let\u2019s start with China, China division system sales grew 12% excluding foreign currency. We were pleased that division operating profit grew at a healthy 21% excluding forex. As David mentioned this is on top of operating profit growth excluding forex in 2008 of 23%. ", "The strong profit performance was fueled by new restaurant development and strong margins versus prior year. In the first quarter we opened a record 98 new restaurants in Mainland China. New units continue to meet our high expectations with projected return on investment of about 30%. This is an all-in return taking into consideration estimated sales transfer of nearby stores and an allocation of corporate G&A.", "Trust me, as long as we continue to expect this type of return we will continue to rapidly expand in China. ", "Restaurant margins were 23% in the first quarter or 1.7 points above prior year. This increase in margin was primarily driven by 2008 pricing actions and moderating commodity inflation. You may recall that throughout 2008 margins were negatively impacted by significant commodity inflation partially offset by pricing. ", "It is nice to see the commodity environment move in a more favorable direction. In fact, we now expect $50 million of commodity deflation in China for the full year after the first quarter that saw commodity inflation of $3 million. Now let\u2019s move to Yum! Restaurants International.", "Top line growth remained robust as system sales growth prior to forex translation was 10% and was driven by same store sales growth of 6% and net unit development of plus 5%. Importantly our franchisees continue to lead this growth as they opened 97% of our first quarter new restaurants. ", "As expected YRI margins were down one point, primarily due to the loss of our exemption of the Mexican value added tax, or VAT, as well as commodity inflation. Since we lost this VAT exemption in the first quarter of 2008, VAT will not impact our results for the remainder of this year. ", "YRI completed the first quarter on target by growing operating profit 4% excluding foreign currency translation and continued to achieve balanced growth driven by our outstanding franchise partners. However, forex is having a major impact on this business, dampening first quarter profits by $21 million and resulting in lower dollar profits in 2009 then 2008.", "In the United States same store sales decline of 2% came in below expectations due to declines of 3% of Pizza Hut and 7% at KFC partially offset by same store sales growth of 2% at Taco Bell. Despite these negative US sales, we saw a first quarter US margins grow 80 basis points. We are seeing an improved commodity environment in the US. In the first quarter we saw commodity inflation of $9 million which was below our expectations. ", "For the balance of 2009 we currently expect to see modest commodity deflation. US profitability in 2009  will benefit from the restructuring which was completed in late 2008 and early 2009. The $20 million in G&A savings in the first quarter was slightly ahead of schedule mainly due to project timing. ", "We continue to anticipate $50 million in cost savings for the full year. We are quite proud of the efforts of our US teams to achieve these productivity improvements. This blend of restaurant margin improvement and G&A reductions led to operating profit growth of 7% in the US in the first quarter. ", "Our full year 2009 profit plans has always been backend loaded so we are quite satisfied with our first quarter profit performance. While we are planning for a weak consumer atmosphere to persist we are excited by the recent launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. This thoroughly tested product has demonstrated the ability to bring in new customers to our restaurants and successfully broaden the appeal of the KFC brand. ", "Prior to closing the books on the US I would like to briefly mention that our refranchising program has continued to progress forward. Although tight credit markets continue to slow certain transactions, we refranchised over 100 restaurants in the first quarter, predominantly Pizza Huts, and we are on pace to achieve our full year target of 500 refranchised units. ", "When you pull it all together it is great to see each of our divisions achieve profit growth prior to forex translation in this challenging environment. ", "The EPS growth of 14% before special items also benefited from the significantly lower tax rate and few average diluted shares outstanding. All in all, we were quite pleased with our first quarter results.

We expect that the second quarter will likely mark the low point of the year.

", "Let\u2019s remember that during 2008 the same store sales comparisons in Mainland China were plus 125 in Q1, plus 14% in Q2, plus 5% in Q3 and plus 1% in Q4. The difficulty of the second quarter lap is typified by last year\u2019s March amazing same store sales growth of 28% for KFC. In 2009 March same store sales growth was negative as we lapped this incredible performance. ", "The lap eased considerably to single-digit growth by the end of the second quarter. While we will likely see negative overall same store sales in the second quarter in China, we have already begun to see improvement in current trends.

In particular we are overlapping significantly easier sales numbers for our China business as I just outlined. ", "We expect to experience favorable year over year commodity cost upsides. The introduction of Kentucky Grilled Chicken, which combined with other initiatives should generate better US sales results. We expect the negative impact of forex to moderate during the year especially in the fourth quarter.

", "First of all, we are living in a difficult environment to make forecasts. As you all know over the past year we have seen huge volatility in the stock market and in commodity markets. In our restaurant world it is harder then normal to predict how sales and costs will play out the remaining part of this year.

We will not however sacrifice our long-term growth. We recognize that one of the things that makes Yum! special is our global growth. As we have stated before, we believe we have a very long runway for this growth. ", "Therefore we will continue to make investments. As an example, we continue to build new [east dining] units in China and new Taco Bell units in YRI even though we recognize that these brands will probably not contribute significantly to Yum!\u2019s overall profits for the next 10 years. ", "The first quarter announcement of a 20% stake in a China hot pot concept is another indication of our long-term approach to growth and investment. We remain very confident of our growth strategies. We believe we are making strong progress in developing sales layers. We remain the largest retail developer outside the US and we are strengthening our brands around the globe.", "I believe we are doing this in a way that is both consistent with our people-oriented culture and is very mindful of our responsibility to add shareholder value.

For instance you rolled out lasagna this quarter, I\u2019m wondering how much that puts at risk this grilled chicken rollout that would of course be that same sort of target, multiple party family group that\u2019s been so under pressure, how you\u2019re thinking about how in general you\u2019ll position stuff for the family better to make it work. ", "David Novak ", "I think you know, whenever you have a marketing opportunity that\u2019s big, its usually when you\u2019ve solved the biggest problem that occurs most frequently. And the biggest problem that occurs most frequently for KFC is that people are looking for a non-fried option. So this is a quantum problem that we\u2019ve got a great solution for. ", "So we think that this brand, this product will hold up well in this environment. The other thing is the team has done a very good job to think about the challenge of dinner and if you\u2019ll notice we\u2019re currently launching Kentucky Grilled Chicken with a two piece complete meal offering for $3.99, and people believe this to be a tremendously good value at the low end so we\u2019ve got a strong low end value. ", "The other thing is is that we\u2019ve got breakthrough bucket promotions scheduled because now we give the consumer the choice of both fried and grilled products. And the other thing that we\u2019ve done is that we\u2019ve significantly improved the quality of our advertising versus test. We\u2019re basically asking people to unthink KFC. You think of us primarily as fried chicken, well we\u2019re not only fried chicken, that great fried chicken you love, but we now have unfried chicken as well.

Our team members are very excited about this product. They\u2019ve all tried the product. Our customer compliments are coming in at higher levels then any that we\u2019ve had for any product. So we\u2019re very excited about this. Its early in the launch but we think that this brand or sub brand of KFC, Kentucky Grilled Chicken, will hold up well in this pretty challenging environment for dinner as you pointed out.

But we had almost unprecedented levels month to month, which we had plus 28% in March as we said. It actually drops to plus 85 in May on the KFC side. So over the quarter we probably expect to see similar types of two year growth, but we\u2019re going to see different types of results month to month just because of the unusual 2008 overlaps.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Another question on China, I wonder if you could just give us a little bit of a broader update on the consumer environment there, your sales building initiatives, and how you\u2019re sustaining your average check in that market. ", "Richard Carucci ", "We really haven\u2019t changed our approach that much in China. One thing to keep in mind is just the impact that we had on pricing and inflation last year. We had very large commodity inflation on chicken that started in late 2007 that went throughout last year. That sort of forced us almost to take pricing throughout the year, and always chasing that piece. So the impact that pricing had actually moderate throughout the year because we start to unravel, unwind from those price increases that we took in 2008.", "But basically the trends that are different in China really the stuff that David talked about in his speech, we continue to build sales layers in breakfast, delivery, and more proteins and that\u2019s the direction we keep going in China as we continue to broaden our menu and broaden our appeal.

", "Richard Carucci ", "We\u2019ve been working hard, so one of the things that didn\u2019t happen, which I mentioned earlier, where we did benefit from commodities and the relationship between commodities and pricing. But we\u2019ve been working hard on the little things so its sort of the day in and day out pieces but you probably also saw some improvement in the labor line and as an example of that, at Taco Bell had a get ready in the morning program that simplified the start up of their operation which allowed them to take labor out. ", "And all the brands are doing sort of their versions of that and so what usually happens with stuff, it\u2019s a bunch of little stuff but I think part of it is we sort of knew coming into the year we were going to have to be very focused on the cost side and we got the benefit of not having to chase the price in commodity piece so now you\u2019re seeing that flow all the way through. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "And I guess it looks like your outlook is a little on the conservative side, I mean if you carry through this kind of margin improvement for the rest of the year, or was there certain things in the quarter that will be difficult to sustain, maybe with pricing rolling off or something like that. I\u2019m just trying to understand how to think about the rest of the year on the margin side. ", "Richard Carucci ", "Well as I sort of said, its really hard to predict what the sales and commodity impact will be exactly so we gave you our best expectations of that in the call. We\u2019re going to keep working on those other little things. So I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll always get as big an impact we had on the labor side. On the flipside of that though I expect during the year we may benefit a little bit more on some leases because we are obviously pushing back on lease costs and we probably will get some benefits of that later part of the year.

But you know, KFC for the first time, we now have a national value menu and hats off to Roger Eaton and the team for being able to get the franchisees on board on that and the franchisees are very excited about the direction of the company.

So there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that we have positioned our back of the house capability with the addition of ovens. The focus that we put on operations at KFC, the team has been just relentless at getting our stores clean, getting our staffing right, getting ready for this launch. ", "So, and while we\u2019re not perfect, we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction from an operating standpoint and I think we\u2019re doing the right things to get KFC set up for more growth in the future. Pizza Hut which is also being hit by the dinner issue that we\u2019ve talked about, strategically we are right on the money with what we\u2019re doing. We are continuing to [fortify] our pizza position by improving our product quality with the improved ingredients.

We\u2019ll be launching Wing Street nationally with national advertising in the fourth quarter of this year. And there\u2019s no doubt that as we go forward that pizza plus pasta plus chicken is going to give us a greater opportunity to leverage our assets throughout the week and we\u2019re also working on lower priced items that will help us get into the lunch/snacking day part as we go forward. ", "So the team is very focused on leveraging the assets that we have which is a huge advantage that we have and moving away from just being a Friday, Saturday, Sunday business. So that\u2019s, there\u2019s no doubt that strategically we\u2019re doing the right stuff there. I think the biggest challenge we have at Pizza Hut is we\u2019ve got to communicate it. ", "When you stand for pizza for 50 years, and that\u2019s what you are, its hard to overnight get credit for having phenomenal pastas, which we have and by the way the customers tell us they want this, okay, and its hard to get credit for having chicken. And its going to take time for us to communicate this and what we\u2019re really pushing for as a team is more provocatively communicating the tremendous transformation that\u2019s going on at Pizza Hut. ", "And I\u2019m confident that the team will do that over time. Taco Bell, which is 60% of our profits in the US, is having a very solid year and we expect it to have a very solid year. We continue to add to the quality of the menu. We continue to fortify, about our why pay more value proposition. You\u2019ll be seeing some great chicken products that will be introduced in that as we go forward. And we\u2019re making our beverage line, Frutista, even more and more appealing as we think about how we leverage that equipment.

So strategically, I am absolutely convinced that we\u2019re doing the right stuff in the US and there is no doubt in my mind that we\u2019re going to get through this year and be stronger and better as we go into 2010.", "So this is a slug-it-out year clearly. We\u2019re not happy with what\u2019s going on with our dinner business which is Pizza Hut and KFC primarily, but I am very happy with the actions that we\u2019re taking to build these brands, make them more broadly appealing as we go into the future which is really the must have that we\u2019ve got to have in the US.

So that clearly takes some of the fun out of your business, even though you\u2019re as strong as can be. And I think that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening with Taco Bell right now. We have a very strong platform, the number one platform in value in the category which is allowing us to get positive same store sales growth and we\u2019ve got the why pay more menu that we are going to be bringing news to as we go forward.", "But this is, I characterize this as a slug-it-out year.

", "Richard Carucci ", "The margin piece first, on the labor side, the thing that we have done is we\u2019ve reduced the number of managers in the restaurants, in some of the lower volume restaurants and that was sort of a planned initiative that started towards the back end of the year.

Obviously what I said about being hard to forecast in this environment is true, but the leading reasons for that decline, really the biggest one is chicken.

We know what the kind of breakfast that McDonald\u2019s has built over time.", "Well, we\u2019re building that breakfast and so that gives us lots of upside as we go in the future. So I think what the team has been very focused on is not over reacting to short-term issues and making sure that we build the overall value of our brand by giving the consumer lots of innovation. Our strategy at KFC has been innovation. And I\u2019ve heard some people talk about, well our street vendor has taken business away, well street vendors have been around since the Ming Dynasty.

", "Richard Carucci ", "Well in terms of Taco Bell on the profitability side, Taco Bell, we\u2019re not going to breakdown brand by brand on profits, but Taco Bell because they have the best sales outperformed out total US business and I mentioned on the margin initiatives, the one that I did mention was that Taco Bell initiative in terms of having the morning startup being more efficient. ", "So we\u2019re very pleased with the work that\u2019s being done there. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "And as far as kind of the second piece to that, the down 6% profit excluding the G&A going to plus 6% for the year. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "Keep in mind the margins were up almost two points so it was more then just G&A. The only thing is keep in mind KFC and Pizza Hut comps were negative. We expect as the year progresses, I think we mentioned it earlier in the call, that we expect especially the second half performance led by the two that were down, KFC, the grilled chicken launch, we expect some benefits from that. ", "And we always expected the second half to be stronger. That was what we said even back in December. Its always going to be a tough first half. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "On the Kentucky Grilled Chicken launch, as far as year over year comparability on media impressions, is that significantly higher or are we thinking is that ultimately it\u2019s the same amount of money being spent, its just on a new platform. ", "David Novak ", "I think we\u2019ve put a lot up against this, but its I think basically within the same budget that we had last year. There isn\u2019t any incremental spending behind it. One thing I would point out to you though is that one of the marketing things that we will be doing on Monday, April 27 is that we\u2019ll be making that on Friday and we\u2019re going to be offering a free piece of chicken at every KFC, all day, any time the restaurant is open. ", "So, we\u2019re going to be encouraging all America to come in and try Kentucky Grilled Chicken and get a piece of it and enjoy it. We think it\u2019s a product that if we can get it in people\u2019s mouths, are going to come back and eat it again and again, because it stands up to our, the quality of our original recipe. And so, the key here is to getting [trial] and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing. ", "But we are not making a significant incremental investment from an overall media perspective behind Kentucky Grilled Chicken. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Sticking with the US, talking about the dinner day part at Pizza Hut and KFC, you kind of attributed what you think is the competitive move of consumers moving back to the maybe at home consumption I believe, to what extent do you think some of these casual diners which seem to be moving their menu price points down and that seems to be intensifying further, how much of that could be playing a role because it doesn\u2019t look like its going to get much easier. ", "David Novak ", "We haven\u2019t quantified that. Really couldn\u2019t quantify that right now. I always say this, when anytime anybody starts getting in your arena, it takes the fun out of your business. So I don\u2019t think anybody is walking around saying, this is a really fun year. I don\u2019t care who you\u2019re talking to, because everybody is very, everybody is striving to get those sales dollars out there. ", "Having said that, there\u2019s nothing like having great powerful brands and there\u2019s two things that drive your business in any kind of situation like this. We\u2019ve done all kinds, we\u2019ve looked at every economy and all the history, the brands that are offering great innovation and offering good relative value, they can do well in these times. And I\u2019m very proud of the performance of Taco Bell. Taco Bell improved their margins. Taco Bell had positive same store sales growth overlapping 9% growth last year. So I think Taco Bell had a pretty damn good quarter and we think that Taco Bell is going to have a very good year.", "KFC and Pizza Hut have not had enough true innovation or enough value to separate themselves from the rest of the pack and as I\u2019ve said before that\u2019s when you\u2019re results languish. And I think KFC\u2019s challenge is to make sure we launch Kentucky Grilled Chicken well and get trial of that product and I think the numbers will reverse in spite of the fact that people are eating or cooking more at home.", "I think if we do the job and do it well and this product is as good as we think it is, we\u2019ll be able to report some good results and that\u2019s what our intent. I think our challenge at Pizza Hut is that our product innovation is a lot better then our marketing because we\u2019re not getting enough credit for the fact that we got unbelievable pastas, at incredible value, and our pizzas are in the same vein. So we\u2019ve got to really start marketing the transformation that\u2019s going on there so the consumer really gets it. ", "Because right now, I think where we stand primarily for pizza versus pizza and the pastas that we have and then we\u2019ve got to build awareness of Wing Street in the fourth quarter when we launch that brand with national advertising which I think because it is real innovation and it will see positive results from that. ", "So we don\u2019t really have a lot of stories to tell around here. The bottom line, this is like what are we doing, okay, to win in the marketplace and I think we did enough to win with Taco Bell in the first quarter and not enough at KFC and Pizza Hut in the first quarter and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to make more progress as we move through the year. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "", "A couple of questions as we kind of think about you mentioned the back half of the year presumably getting better, being more second half weighted, if it was necessary that you needed more levers to pull to drive the 10% loss EPS growth, just wondering whether you see the G&A opportunity as potentially more meaningful. It seems like you kept the $60 million, you achieved 20 sooner then you thought, whether there\u2019s upside there or whether you\u2019d reconsider share repurchase as we move half way through the year with cash accumulating, I\u2019m just wondering what are the potential levers you might have there. ", "Richard Carucci ", "Well we\u2019re not planning any other major actions at this time so I think it\u2019s the actions we\u2019ve taken will be where we\u2019re at. I think $60 million is still a pretty good number. What I said before though is we each have our budgets, given that we\u2019ve sort of said it\u2019s a slug-it-out year, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to miss their numbers. So if anything, there may be some small upsides to that number, but I wouldn\u2019t assume anything significant. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "On commodity inflation, we did have some, keep in mind from a US perspective we had I think about $8 million of inflation in Q1 in the US and we\u2019ll probably have just a little bit in Q2 and then in Q3 and Q4, the back half is definitely deflation. So even though you had a pretty significant benefit in Q1, there is still a pretty good swing from first half to second half in that category as well. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "So the US cost of goods that already over 100 basis points of favorability this quarter would only seem to accelerate in terms of additional favorability the rest of the year. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "Just in terms of commodity inflation the best year over year will probably be Q3. So you have a little bit of inflation this quarter, a little bit less next quarter but still some inflation and then the back half will be all deflation. So there will still be continuing benefits. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "And the potential for share repurchase, I know you talked about reconsidering midway through the year, is that something that you would do at this point or are you still looking to stockpile cash. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "We are very focused on strengthening our balance sheet in very tough financial times and we have no plans for share buyback at this point in time for this year, no plans at least. We\u2019re always evaluating that but we\u2019ll be in the second half focused on debt reduction. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Just on China, just wondering it seems like you\u2019re going full speed ahead which seems to be the right approach for you, I\u2019m just wondering whether you\u2019re seeing [press] disparity by tier, I know you said you\u2019ve kind of changed your growth plans periodically just based on tier 1 versus tier 6, just wondering whether you\u2019re seeing disparity in terms of results there that would lead you to change your growth plans, or how the different tiers stacked. ", "Richard Carucci ", "No over time what\u2019s occurred is that we probably have been going into the year a little bit more aggressive on the lower tiered places and a little bit more conservative on the top tier cities, especially on the Pizza Hut side. On the KFC side, we are looking at probably some shifts not necessarily by tier but geographically depending on sort of the impact on the export business. But those are not hugely significant but there will be some adjusting that occurs there. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Are you seeing the southern markets be weaker then the northern, was that by geography what you mean by that. ", "Richard Carucci ", "", "Eastern and southern are a bit weaker. They tend to be the areas that have impacted more on the export reduction. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "Our southern markets are definitely several points below the market average, which is what you would expect. ", "David Novak ", "And I think in its own way kind of points out the strength of our China business because we\u2019re so dispersed throughout the country in 500 cities, and we can go where the fish are really biting. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "As Richard said earlier, we are looking at the central and west as I\u2019m sure as you\u2019ve read the government is spending a lot more money infrastructure wise in the central and west part of the country. We have representation there already because of our distribution system that can take us anywhere and we\u2019re going to continue to leverage that as Richard said. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Just lastly the KFC with the grilled product I think you said at the Analyst Day, that I guess in test market that it was doing something like an initial 8% lift to sales and you thought you\u2019d be able to capture or keep 4% of that, or half of that over time, is that still a reasonable assumption layering in on top of what your current comp trends are. ", "Richard Carucci ", "No, I think we said [what was going to say] about the grilled, again a lot of things have changed in terms of where the base business was etc. so obviously next call we\u2019ll have a lot more to say on the results. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve West \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Steve West \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "", "Just a quick question on the grilled chicken sales and kind of following up on that last question, what are the sales trends that you did see in the test markets, was there a big spike when you\u2019re kind of supporting it with TV advertising and then followed by subsequent pullback, it seems like that\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen in a couple of the test markets I\u2019ve seen out there. ", "", "Richard Carucci ", "What we saw was, we saw a decent spike but it was actually a build in spike. It wasn\u2019t the way some promotions were where the first week or two weeks is the strongest and [inaudible]. It actually built more then some of our other promotions did and then again, we had several test markets and it held at different times half its value once we took it off etc. but then we pulsed it as well with some smaller advertising thereafter.", "So again I think that this is going to be quite different for some of the reasons David talked about and that we\u2019re putting a very big effort against it right now with different types of advertising and my guess is even the way we decide to pulse future advertising maybe a bit different then the test. But the thing that was good about the test is that a decent chunk of it stayed on even with very limited advertising and clearly our goal is to make this, not just a permanent part of the menu but a significant part of the menu for a long time. ", "Steve West \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Have you gotten any kind of consumer feedback on, I know the chicken tastes great but its smaller and so I was wondering in this value environment are you getting kind of any consumer pushback on paying the same price for what appears to be a smaller piece of chicken. ", "David Novak ", "I think consumer generally knows its smaller because there isn\u2019t breading on the chicken. We have had in some isolated markets some issues with piece size which we\u2019ve gotten all over and its mainly where products might not have been in the spec range so we\u2019re very well aware of that but we have not had any abnormal complaints. ", "In fact what we are getting is abnormal compliments. We\u2019re getting more compliments at KFC then we\u2019ve ever had in our history on any product. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "And I would add since I have some KFC background, I\u2019m even getting compliments from the buy side community from folks who are already trying it and I\u2019ve never gotten that before.", "David Novak ", "Well those guys don\u2019t have a heart. Just kidding. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "", "Congratulations on a good start to the year, question on the outlook, what type of comps do you think you need to get to a 10% EPS growth number for the year given all the improvements you\u2019re seeing in the cost outlook. ", "Richard Carucci ", "I couldn\u2019t begin to answer that exactly because obviously so much depends on China and not just the US so, but what we are assuming in general is that because of the commodity piece is we can do with lower sales then normal. So normally we say same store sales in the two to three range, we could do with probably several points below that in this commodity environment and get to where we want to get to. ", "But obviously it depends on a lot of factors, but that\u2019s sort of one thing to think about. Probably throughout the globe, I sort of think China as well, we could probably get there with a couple points less then normal if the commodity situation holds the way we\u2019ve sort of talked about it today. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "A couple of points for the full year. ", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird ", "And then a question on the YRI business, which was very strong on the top line and you mentioned a few countries in particular, the UK and Japan and Australia, are you seeing the economies in those markets start to rebound or improve or are you doing something specifically to drive the business there. ", "David Novak ", "Actually I was talking to Albert [Milotti], who\u2019s doing a great job running our Australian business last night, and actually the economy is looking tougher there. The unemployment is projected to go, get higher, so I think what we have in our global markets is one of the big advantages I think we do have is we have less competition. When we look at global brands, you\u2019re looking at McDonald\u2019s, Pizza Hut, and KFC primarily in most markets. You can add Burger King, and Dominos in other markets but you don\u2019t have the tremendous proliferation of chains that you have in the United States there so, people, when people say well you ought to be doing better in a tough economy, I think its better to do better in a tough economy when you have less competition. ", "But I also can tell you that we\u2019ve had tremendous innovation in Australia, Japan, and the UK on a relative basis and it goes back to that formula I was talking about earlier. When we\u2019re doing our job we do well and I think it\u2019s a combination of us doing our job well plus less competition I think allows us to be successful there. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Fitzhugh Taylor - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "Fitzhugh Taylor - Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "I just had more of a longer-term question, you mentioned earlier in India in the call, there are obviously a lot of similarities from population and unit growth opportunities with China and I was wondering if, how much you\u2019ve considered maybe an owned infrastructure and owned unit system there similar to China versus to the typical franchise YRI model. ", "David Novak ", "I think we\u2019re looking at balanced approach in India, not as dramatic as what we have in China which is primarily all equity but what we are doing right now is we\u2019re investing equity to get KFC and Taco Bell established. Pizza Hut there is basically 100% franchise and so what we think we\u2019ll have over time in India is a balance between equity and franchise, both KFC and Taco Bell. ", "So, we\u2019re very optimistic about India because our brands are being so well received and people like the food so much. We actually think Taco Bell may have the highest degree of opportunity in India because of the great vegetarian products, the carrier, the spiciness of the food, which we can even modify to be more relevant to the Indian taste. So these are brands, both KFC and Taco Bell, that we\u2019re very well prepared to invest equity in but at the same time, we think we\u2019ll have a balance between equity and franchise long-term in India. ", "Richard Carucci ", "And regarding your question on distribution, in China we got into that when obviously the economy was infant when we got there, but you didn\u2019t have a lot of professional distribution that we thought had the ability to get national scale quickly, that could handle things like refrigeration etc. In India there actually are a couple of very professional distributors already established there so there\u2019s really not the need to do that. ", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "", "First off, just on YRI with comps up 65, is that a system wide comp or a company operated comp.", "Tim Jerzyk ", "System wide.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Can you give us just some of the highlights and lowlights on that six, it was particularly strong, was there anything that was particularly weak or just above average.", "Richard Carucci ", "I\u2019d say, well first of all we\u2019ve got some detail in the release in terms of geography, nothing really jumps out of the page. I think [inaudible] one of the things that I\u2019ve been pleasantly pleased and surprised with is just the number of countries that we\u2019ve had that are positive. Whenever you obviously have a global business, we\u2019re in 100 countries we have a large number of them usually up and down at a point in time and probably for the last year and a half, we\u2019ve had an abnormally large percentage be up and that\u2019s sort of been holding up pretty well. ", "Our weakest markets, that impact us the most, have been a couple of our equity markets, Mexico and Pizza Hut Korea. We haven\u2019t seen big trend changes in those businesses. They\u2019ve been an issue for the last year or so. ", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Just on KFC US, I think last quarter you may have mentioned a comps target of 7% for the year, are you revising that target at all. ", "Richard Carucci ", "What I sort of said before is our expectation is probably a couple of points lower at least in the US for the full year but we haven\u2019t sort of broken that out by brand yet. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "That\u2019s because of Q1 being below what we expected. ", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "And the China comp target of 5% is still on track at this point.", "Richard Carucci ", "We\u2019re going to update our sort of numbers at the next release sort of across the business, again early to try to make the full year call changes at this point but again, probably we expect China to be worse then what we thought in the first half but we still feel pretty good about what we thought would happen in the second half. ", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Just on the US cost savings, the $20 million that happened a little sooner then expected, can you just identify maybe some of the bigger buckets in that $20 million. ", "Richard Carucci ", "Well the $20 million, the overall piece, I mean most of it we did expect, it was due to headcount reductions associated with the restructuring that we did of our business. The extra amount is just sort of we had some projects timing across the board that some of that money is going to be spent later in the year but again, the large part of it we did expect its just a little higher then what we thought it would be. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "", "Question on YRI if I may, obviously the division did not participate in the commodity improvement of the store level cost management as did the other divisions, and that is even excluding the Mexico VAT change, so if you could whether for the rest of 2009 or going into next year what could change that. Is it just a matter of focusing on those numbers and secondly, do you think your G&A is structured correctly in dollars for YRI especially given the fact that I guess you said 95% of your growth is from franchisees.", "Richard Carucci ", "Well the first piece of it, you\u2019re right, the commodities in YRI are different then US and China and there\u2019s a couple of reasons for it. First of all YRI tends to have longer-term contracts so we did not get as big a downside, nearly as big a downside in YRI last year because we were locked in on longer-term contracts in 2008 then we experienced in the US and China.", "And we\u2019re sort of getting the reverse of that this year as we did lock in some of the longer-term contracts in 2008 before sort of the commodities came down. So we were locking in higher costs for 2009 YRI so YRI will sort of either reverse of what the US and China was, was that they weren\u2019t impacted too much this year. ", "We expect them to not get the benefit this year though as well and in fact, so they\u2019re probably get more of that benefit in 2010 if things stay low. So that\u2019s one piece of it. The second dynamic on the YRI piece is that a fair number of the costs, especially of a couple of our equity markets, Japan, sorry Korea and Mexico, were sort of either US based or influenced strongly by the US dollar. So we are getting some commodity inflation due to that in some of our equity businesses. ", "So we expect commodity increases at YRI to get slightly less as the year unfolds so we expect less of an increase in the balance of 2009 then what we saw in the first quarter but we still expect overall increases of YRI.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "On G&A, I mean that hasn\u2019t been a focus for you, obviously the US has and the money you\u2019re taking out is significant, is there a similar type of thought that you might be able to put to work at YRI.", "Richard Carucci ", "Let\u2019s remember, on the US piece what drove it was the refranchising, right, so it takes fewer resources to manage a franchise restaurant then it does a company owned restaurant and that\u2019s really what drove the US piece of it. YRI ownership percentage has been there, again, it goes up and down slightly but its pretty much stayed where its been for a while. So the only place, time we expect to see anything on the G&A side was if we refranchise a market which in the scheme of things isn\u2019t going to make a huge difference on the overall number.", "And clearly we are investing in some of the growth markets like India, France, etc. where we\u2019re building up longer-term businesses in those countries when you start out you do have a little bit more as a percentage of sales on G&A so we\u2019ll get some benefit of G&A leverage down the road as those markets become more mature. ", "", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Quick question on Pizza Hut, we\u2019ve talked about the strategy, we\u2019ve talked about one of the biggest challenges being communicating the changes in product offerings, as you think about this year, you\u2019ve got Wing Street coming really in fourth quarter, you\u2019ve got the Panormous, and you are lapping last year\u2019s pasta hut introduction, how should I think about the marketing budget for this year. How you improve that awareness and communicate those changes, so how you approach the marketing budget for the balance of this year pre that fourth quarter introduction, and maybe what you do with pricing and promotional effort to help as well. ", "David Novak ", "Well I think, again we aren\u2019t spending incrementally. We\u2019ve got significant budgets because we\u2019ve built into our contracts in both company and franchise stores so, the advertising is more of a fixed cost but what the team is doing is they\u2019re focused on layers, tiered spending, making sure that we spend on pasta and pizza simultaneously and then when we launch Wing Street it will be supported with money that\u2019s been put in to the budget as a percent of Wing Street sales. ", "So, I think I would look at the way we spin the market to bring more on a layered basis or a tiered basis. ", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "In China one of the things that we talked about back at the Analyst Day and in the original guidance for the year was the opportunity for G&A leverage in this model going forward and despite the profit upside in the quarter actually G&A was pretty much flat as a percent of sales year over year, really wasn\u2019t a lot of leverage. How should we think about given the potentially weaker first half sales environment potential for G&A leverage in China this year. ", "Richard Carucci ", "What we have said is that if you look at our broad model that in the past we have not gotten G&A leverage, right, so if you look at how we\u2019ve gotten sales and profits in the past it was pretty much led by unit development. We expect still unit development to take the largest part of our growth but what we said would occur over time is we get a little bit more from two areas. One pricing which we\u2019ve already started to do, that was led by unusual chicken cost increase a year and a half ago. So we expect to get modest pricing and we also said we should start to see some G&A leverage. ", "I think we had about a point of leverage in the first quarter so we saw a little bit of it coming but I think where we\u2019re going to get it is still going to be over time and it doesn\u2019t have to be a huge amount of money. Don\u2019t forget we\u2019re continuing to invest in start up ramps like [east dining] and pizza at home service etc. but we are starting to see a little bit of leverage on the KFC side. ", "I expect that leverage to hopefully grow a little bit over time. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", "And we did in total revenues we were up 19% and our G&A was up 16% so we did get a little bit of leverage, the growth was less then revenue, that is definitely a little bit better then in the past and then also keep in mind we were lapping leap year which impacted the top line by a couple of points. ", "", "Operator", "There are no additional questions at this time; I would like to turn it back over to management for any additional or closing comments. ", "David Novak ", "I\u2019ll just briefly wrap up here, first our China business is on solid ground and continues to grow as we build leading brands and develop new units with high returns. We believe the Chinese economy is stabilizing and remember China is still the number one restaurant opportunity for the 21st century and we are very well positioned there. ", "Second Yum! Restaurants International continues to be the division that we think has the greatest long-term potential for Yum! Brands and continues to produce consistent results with the strength of its broad based business in over 110 countries with 700 franchisees. ", "Third our US business is now set up with a more efficient operating structure and is focused on executing new incremental sales layers that we\u2019ve talked about and our ownership strategy. We expect that with the moves that we\u2019re making this year to strengthen our brand. We expect each one of our brands to go into 2010 stronger and better positioned more with opportunities to leverage the assets that we have.", "And finally we expect to generate a huge amount of cash coming from each of our divisions as we grow our business and maintain our industry-leading return on invested capital. And with all these things we expect to, we can achieve our EPS growth target of 10% in 2009 and beyond. I want to emphasize that the second quarter will be our toughest quarter but we expect very good second half performance.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. ", "(Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to introduce Mr. Tim Jerzyk, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Nicole, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I just want to give you a reminder before we start into the normal part of our call. It is time to make plans to attend our 2006 annual conference for investors and analysts.

We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of this recording. I would also like to advise that this conference call does include forward-looking statements that reflects managements\u2019 expectations based on currently available data. However, actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties. ", "The information in the conference call related to projections or other forward-looking statements may be relied on subject to our Safe Harbor statement, which is included in our earnings release last night and may continue to be used while this call remains in the active portion of our company\u2019s website, which will be until about 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, Friday, October 20, 2006. ", "On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions.", "Now I will turn the call over to David Novak. ", "David C. Novak", "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everybody. As you may have seen from our third quarter release last night, we reported outstanding results for the quarter, with 11% worldwide operating profit growth and 20% EPS growth. Importantly, each of our businesses contributed to operating profit growth and margin expansion to this performance. ", "Our growth this quarter was led by our high return international divisions, with across-the-board strong growth in new restaurants, same-store sales, and profits. China Division profits increased by 26% and YRI by 22%. Better news yet, we expect China operating profit to be up 35% to 40% for 2006. ", "Based on this strong performance, I am pleased to report we have raised our forecasted EPS for 2006 by $0.06 to $2.89, or 14% growth. ", "We believe the growth opportunities for our portfolio of brands around the world is second to none. Consider this: China and YRI each already make more profits than companies like Wendy\u2019s, Applebee\u2019s, or Ruby Tuesday\u2019s. Yum! China will generate nearly $300 million in profit and, as I said, growing by at least 35% to 40% this year. YRI will generate about $400 million in profit this year and grow by at least 10% once again. ", "Unlike the U.S., which is extremely penetrated, we have just begun to capture the huge new unit opportunities in our international businesses. Also unlike the U.S., we have very little competition. ", "This is how we very simply think about our growth opportunities outside the U.S. We have over 18,000 traditional restaurants in the United States, where there are about 300 million people. We have about 2,000 restaurants in mainland China with 1.3 billion people. YRI has about 12,000 restaurants for over 4 billion people. We think that provides us with major opportunities for expansion of our brand portfolio. ", "In addition to what we believe is the most powerful and proven international opportunity in our category is our tremendous cash flow generation led by our U.S. portfolio, consistently over $1 billion every year in terms of EBITDA. Additionally, our already substantial annual cash flows are enhanced by our refranchise program. This has enabled us to produce strong shareholder payouts. In fact, we expect to return over $1 billion to shareholders this year, which is a repeat of last year. Our substantial stock buy-backs will continue to be impactful, reducing our share count this year by 6% after a 2% reduction last year. Additionally, we will pay a dividend that will return another 1% to shareholders in 2006. We fully expect to return similar total amounts to shareholders for the foreseeable future. ", "Finally, our global portfolio enables consistency of performance. This will be our fifth straight year of at least 13% EPS growth and exceeding our annual target of at least 10% growth. In addition, the free cash flow generation from every segment of our portfolio will enable us to pay out another $1 billion plus to shareholders in 2006. ", "Now let\u2019s look at each of our businesses. Let\u2019s look at China first. ", "In our China division, as I said last quarter, we are back and booming once again. With KFC, we are moving at an aggressive pace in mainland China with development growth of nearly 20%. We now have nearly 1700 KFCs. ", "Returns remain very strong, our very best in the world and we continue to expand in more cities. We will likely be in about 400 cities by year-end, building a great base for the KFC brand everywhere in China. ", "The summary for KFC is we are the dominant leader and we are moving full steam ahead. ", "You also need to recognize that our Pizza Hut casual dining business in mainland China is now a major business as well. We have now reached major scale levels, with over 225 casual dining restaurants and development is strong with excellent returns, similar to KFC. ", "We are excited because Pizza Hut casual dining is growing units at a 20% rate versus last year, with solid same-store sales growth. We are in over 50 cities and clearly the undisputed leader in the casual dining category. ", "Now let\u2019s talk about the third brand we have been working on developing for full scale expansion -- Pizza Hut Home Service. We have 33 units currently in five cities, and the overall economic models for this delivery business looks very promising. We are excited as we just completed a TV test in Shanghai with our first ad campaign to drive this business. The results were very good and we are ready to roll to more cities. ", "There is no doubt the home service market is emerging in mainland China, and we will be there to capitalize on the opportunity. ", "To summarize, our China business had a great third quarter with profit growth of 26%, and we are up 38% year-to-date, so clearly our two-year trends are excellent. Importantly, we are opening over 400 new restaurants and achieving record restaurant margins, even while rapidly developing and building new brands like Pizza Hut Home Service and East Dawning, our fast food Chinese restaurant concept. ", "We continue to believe that KFC ultimately has the potential for 14,000 locations, similar to the level of development by McDonald\u2019s in the United States, and that we ultimately have the potential for about 2,000 Pizza Hut casual dining locations, similar to Applebee\u2019s in the United States. That is 16,000 restaurants before you would consider the potential of Pizza Hut Home Service and East Dawning. Our belief is that ultimately, we will have at least 20,000 restaurants in China. ", "Now, on to our Yum! Restaurants International Division, or what we call YRI. We are very pleased to see strong performance from our YRI portfolio. For Q3, we achieved 9% growth in system sales, local currency basis, well ahead of our target of at least 5% growth. YRI opened 176 new restaurants in the third quarter, and virtually all of our 452 new restaurant openings this year, or 94% of them were by our franchise and joint venture partners. ", "Most significantly, franchise fees grew by 15% in the third quarter to a new record, and our overall operating margin improved versus last year to another record for the third quarter. ", "YRI generates solid, consistent growth that is geographically diverse with high returns. Importantly, we are not sitting on our success. We are just starting to develop in India, Continental Europe with KFC, and now Russia. We are in the early stages of developing these mega-markets, which we believe will become increasingly important to YRI. ", "Most importantly for YRI, our new unit pipeline looks very good and we now expect at least 770 new openings for 2006, ahead of our original plan for 750 new openings. ", "The fact is, YRI continues to build one heck of a track record. It will be seven straight years of opening over 700 new restaurants. ", "Now let\u2019s talk about where our growth outside the United States is taking us. This year, we expect that YRI will represent nearly 30% of overall Yum! profit, and Yum! China will represent 20%. So nearly 50% of our profit today is coming from international divisions, with at least 75% of our profit growth as well from these businesses. ", "We think we will easily be at 60% international profits in the next five years, with Yum! China and YRI each being at about 30%. ", "Now, on to our U.S. businesses. Before I get into the details, let me give you our view of the U.S. business. First, for the full year, we expect our profit to be up 3% to 5%, which historically stacks up well versus our 1% long-term trend. Our blended U.S. same-store sales is expected to be flat for the year, with our third quarter results down 2%, driven by poor performance at Pizza Hut, which was down 5%. ", "We are working aggressively to turn around Pizza Hut. Importantly, Pizza Hut has the strongest brand equity in the pizza category, which gives us confidence. ", "Looking at both Taco Bell and KFC, we are confident in our market positions. When you look at the two-year growth rates for both of these brands, they are comparable to other big names in the category. For example, Taco Bell and KFC are averaging 2% to 3% growth over the past two years. McDonald\u2019s is averaging 3% to 5%, and Wendy\u2019s is about flat. So Taco Bell and KFC are definitely in the game. ", "We expect Taco Bell and KFC to be up for the full year and Pizza Hut to be down 3%. ", "Having said all that, rest assured that no one is satisfied and we are absolutely focused on getting back on track. In fact, I can tell you for certain we are obsessed with it and we are also very confident that we will deliver. In fact, we believe it is very realistic to target plus 2% to 3% same-store sales growth for our U.S. business again next year, based on the aggressive plans that our dedicated teams are putting in place. ", "Our target is also to grow our profit 5%. We realize that the proof is in the pudding, so you will have to see. ", "Now, let\u2019s look in detail by brand. First, some perspective on Taco Bell, our biggest U.S. business. For Q3, Taco Bell experienced a 2% decline in same store sales, lapping a strong 8% a year ago, or two-year growth of 3%. For the remainder of the year, we do expect sales results to be in a similar pattern as we have experienced recently. We are making some adjustments to products and promotions to help regain our momentum against the difficult comparisons. ", "Looking ahead to 2007, we remain confident in every aspect of the Taco Bell brand. The fundamentals are solid -- brand positioning, our TV ads, our new product pipeline, and our improving operations. ", "We also have major new product news planned for 2007 and we have adjusted our marketing plan that reinforces Taco Bell\u2019s compelling value in what is obviously a tougher competitive environment. ", "Taco Bell has been one of the leaders in growth for the past several years, with 2% same store sales growth expected for 2006, after years of plus 7%, plus 5%, plus 2%, and plus 7%. That is a track record, and we are confident we will once again be in the plus 2% to 3% range at Taco Bell in 2007. ", "Now, on to KFC. KFC delivered flat same-store sales growth in Q3, lapping 6% growth last year, or two-year average growth of 3%. We are up 2% year-to-date, lapping 6% growth a year ago. As with Taco Bell, we believe KFC performance also stacks up fairly well within our category in terms of two-year growth rates. ", "Looking at all aspects of the brand fundamentals, we are confident of the positioning and our TV ads. Operations are improving from a low base but are steadily making progress. We remain very focused on execution against building sales layers around our four new concepts -- Variety Bucket, Snacker, Flavor Station, and our Famous Bowls. You will see continued news in support of these concepts for the balance of the year, including Famous Bowls, which was a very successful new product introduction, which will be coming up in two weeks. ", "Additionally, for our 2007 calendar, we have pulled forward into the second-half of 2007 what we thought was our most compelling new product ideas targeted for 2008. We have an outstanding pipeline of product news at KFC. ", "Now on to Pizza Hut. The picture has changed somewhat, as we have begun to lap weaker performance versus a year ago. Our sales results have improved but are still not where we need to be and transactions remain down for the category overall. ", "I can assure you we are putting a full court press on at Pizza Hut. The good news is the team has been working through a problem detection analysis and other category and brand research to develop a roadmap to a turnaround plan. As we go forward, we will begin to implement our turnaround plan and we believe you will begin to see improved results in 2007 off of this year\u2019s poor performance. ", "Our turnaround plan will be comprehensive in terms of marketing and operating plans. At this time, with a very tough category trend and two major national competitors, I cannot be more specific. ", "I can tell you we are all over this business and we are putting every Yum! resource to bear that will help us turn this business around. We have turned around each of our brands at one point in time, and we will do it again and we will do it with Pizza Hut. All I can say is to trust our track record -- that will happen again. ", "To summarize on the U.S. business, we do not see any significant change for the balance of year in terms of same-store sales growth when looking at likely results in terms of two-year growth rates. We had this factored into our forecasts. We are confident that Taco Bell and KFC each has the right plan in place for the balance of the year and 2007. At Pizza Hut, we will be lapping weak numbers next year and are in the process of making changes, as I mentioned. ", "Based on our Taco Bell and KFC market positions, and the progress we expect to make at Pizza Hut, we remain confident of reaching our plus 2% to 3% same-store sales target for the U.S. in 2007. ", "Beyond the U.S.-based business, we are excited to see that new restaurant development is beginning to ramp up at Taco Bell and with Taco Bell/KFC multi-brands, which will provide us with a new source of profit growth in the U.S. Our franchisees are excited about our new Bold Choice Taco Bell restaurant design and so are our customers. You should expect to see many more across the U.S. over the next several years. Taco Bell U.S. will expand by about 1.5% new units net of closures in 2006. ", "Finally, we expect to make continued progress in upgrading KFC U.S. and Pizza Hut U.S. system restaurants during 2007. For KFC, we expect 600 to 700 upgrade projects to be completed in 2007, most of these by our franchisees. At Pizza Hut, we expect 200 to 300 upgrade projects to be completed, again mostly by our franchisees. All told, there will be significant capital invested by our franchisees next year for image upgrades at KFC and Pizza Hut U.S., as well as Taco Bell for new restaurant growth. ", "To summarize, the power of our global portfolio and international scale and growth makes us not your ordinary restaurant company and a cash-generating machine. Importantly, we will continue to invest substantial company capital in mainland China, which provides high growth, high returns, and ultimately we believe significant scale for Yum!. ", "Over the long-term, we expect to continue to grow our earnings per share at least 10%, pay out substantial cash to shareholders, and build value by executing against our unique international growth opportunities, with high returns that differentiate us from other global consumer companies. Specifically, we will focus on our four key strategies -- building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable international expansion, steadily improving our U.S. brands and operations, and multi-branding category leading brands. ", "Now I will turn it over to Rick Carucci, our CFO, who will take you through the numbers. Rick. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. I am going to review five items today: first, Yum!\u2019s third quarter results; second, Yum!\u2019s year-to-date results; third, our full-year 2006 outlook; fourth, a brief update on our refranchising program; and fifth, an update of our full-year cash flow expectations. ", "Let\u2019s now talk about our third quarter, which was another high-quality quarter. Worldwide operating profit growth was up 11%, and operating margins in all three businesses also improved nicely. ", "Let\u2019s look at Q3 by business segment. ", "China Division restaurant margin was up over three points versus a year ago. Year-to-date margins are well over 21%, which is an all-time record. We are very encouraged by this performance. Needless to say, our China division had an even better quarter than we had expected, with 10% same-store sales growth, record margins, and 26% profit growth. Both the KFC and Pizza Hut casual dining brands had strong sales growth in quarter 3. ", "This quarter also demonstrated the power of development-based growth. Our two-year profit growth in the China Division was 66%. Our two-year development growth in mainland China was 55%. Because we continued to build units, when our sales did bounce back, we knew we would be in a great position regarding profit performance. ", "Yum! Restaurants International also had a very strong third quarter, with 22% operating profit growth. While we had expected strong growth in quarter 3, we are obviously very pleased with this result. Importantly, margin performance was strong with over 20% operating margin, an increase of nearly three points from last year. ", "Same-store sales in company markets increased by 4% after being flat in the first-half of the year. This resulted in an increase in restaurant margin of 0.8%. ", "YRI franchise fees were up 13% in local currency. This was led by a 6% increase in franchise restaurants and by 4% growth in same-store sales. The strongest performing markets were in our franchise-only areas of the world -- South Africa, Caribbean Latin America, Middle East, and Asia. These franchise results led to the strong 2.7 point increase in operating margins. ", "The overall U.K. business showed improved performance versus the first-half of the year. Total third quarter U.K. profits were up 4% on local currency versus prior year, driven by strong same-store sales growth for KFC. ", "Our Pizza Hut U.K. business struggled during Q3, as we were in the late stages of completing the acquisition of Whitbread\u2019s 50% interest in our former joint venture. We expect stronger sales performance for this business in the balance of the year. ", "Turning to the U.S., we had disappointing sales in the third quarter. We did benefit from substantially lower commodity costs following two extremely tough years of commodity inflation. The commodity favorability in the third quarter was $10 million. In addition, closures and impairment expense dropped $13 million versus last year. This largely explains why profits were up slightly, about 1% versus last year, despite same-store sales being down 2%. ", "To summarize, the third quarter was again a high-quality quarter, driven by 11% growth in worldwide operating profit. This outstanding quarterly performance was led by strong growth from our China and YRI divisions, each with profit growth exceeding 20%. ", "In the financial area, we saw a slightly lower tax rate of about 26% versus last year\u2019s rate of about 27%. The lower tax rate offset a $6 million increase in interest expense. The increase was driven primarily from higher rates on the variable rate portion of our debt, and it also reflects slightly higher debt levels this year versus last year. ", "Finally, we continue to make very good progress in reducing our share count, now down to 255 million shares at quarter-end, and a 7% reduction average diluted shares year over year. All of this results in an EPS growth of 20% against the third quarter last year. ", "That wraps up Q3. Now I want to review our year-to-date business performance as we look ahead to 2007. ", "Year-to-date, our worldwide operating profit increased by 14%, led by across-the-board strength in each of our businesses. China was up 38% year-to-date, well above our long-term 20% target. YRI was up 9% year-to-date, close to our long-term 10% target. The U.S. was up 8% year-to-date, above our long-term 5% target. ", "All in all, this represents high quality and strong performance from our global portfolio. Overall year-to-date, we are up $113 million in operating profit. ", "China\u2019s year-to-date results have driven 53% of that growth and YRI 20% of that growth. That is nearly 75% of our year-to-date operating growth from our two international divisions. That has been the picture over the last eight years and we expect that storyline to continue into the foreseeable future. ", "Year-to-date, earnings per share was up 18%, ahead of our operating profit growth. Our significant reduction in share count more than offset a higher year-to-date tax rate and higher year-to-date interest expense. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to our full-year outlook. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, please keep in mind that our reported growth rates will be negatively impacted by the lap of the 53rd week last year. This impacts YRI, the U.S. business, and Yum! overall. Our China division will not be affected. ", "Let\u2019s look first at our U.S. business. In this environment, and with the tough laps at both Taco Bell and KFC balance of year, Q4 is a little hard to read. However, we believe in the U.S., we will finish with between 3% and 5% profit growth overall for 2006, prior to lapping last year\u2019s 53rd week. We have factored this into our overall outlook. ", "We are not particularly bullish on Q4 domestic sales. We do, however, expect favorable commodity costs versus last year, but with lower gains year over year than in the first three quarters. While we are working very hard to turn around our U.S. business, we feel great about Yum!\u2019s overall business. We are confident in our brands. We know our U.S. sales will bounce back and we strongly believe our results will improve over time. ", "Also, we are especially confident about the outlook for China and YRI during the balance of this year. We expect China Division operating profit to be up 35% to 40% for the year, driven by another great year of new unit expansion. We will likely open more than 400 new restaurants. Same-store sales will be solid for the year, and restaurant margins will be up over 20% for the full year. ", "At YRI, we expect operating profit to be up at least 10% for the year, excluding last year\u2019s 53rd week benefit. YRI will have a strong fourth quarter, with over 10% profit growth on a like-for-like basis. ", "For the year overall, the really good news is that we expect solid margin growth in all three businesses. Our growth model is very productive this year and looks very strong for the future. ", "Based on the operating profit strength we discussed, our full-year EPS guidance increases to $2.89, or 14% growth. With our global portfolio, we have a track record of consistently achieving above 10% EPS growth, despite soft results in any quarter or two from any of our businesses. Specifically for 2006, we are demonstrating that we can absorb a tough stretch of U.S. sales and yet have our global portfolio deliver solid double-digit EPS growth. ", "Now I would like to provide you with an update of our refranchising progress. At YRI, we are continuing to refranchise our company units in some smaller scale businesses, namely Pizza Hut businesses in Canada, France, and Australia. We continue to make progress on this front and we have refranchised 157 YRI company restaurants for the past four quarters. ", "With the recent acquisition of our 50% ownership of the Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture, our company ownership is now at 16% at YRI. We will be refranchising in the U.K. over the next two to three years to bring our YRI ownership down to similar levels as before the acquisition. ", "As a result, you should expect us to continue some refranchising at YRI over the next three years. ", "We continue to like our current franchise dominant business model for YRI. Where we do invest our own equity and run company restaurants, we generally look for three things: first, potential for significant scale; second, strong growth potential in the market; and third, strong returns. We will sometimes compromise on one of the first two points but not on the third, the high returns. ", "In the U.S., we continue to make progress against our two-year plan of refranchising at least 1,000 company-owned restaurants. We have refranchised about 200 U.S. company-owned restaurants year-to-date, with at least a similar amount for Q4. ", "As we previously stated, our target at the end of 2007 is to reach 20% blended company ownership in the U.S. from about 26% at the beginning of this year. We expect to reduce our U.S. company-owned restaurant count from about 4700 at the end of 2005 to less than 3700 by year-end 2007. ", "The good news is our two-year U.S. program is progressing well and is currently expected to be completed on time, with a large pool of capable franchise buyers. We expect to meet our financial targets of: A, a 50% basis point improvement in U.S. restaurant margin; B, no impact to operating profit dollars; and C, a 75 basis point improvement in ROIC. ", "We also expect to receive cash of $250 million in 2006, which is above our original $150 million estimate. ", "Now let\u2019s talk about cash flow. We continue to expect to end this year with another record of about $1.3 billion in net cash provided by operating activity. We will invest about $625 million on capital spending during the year, which will result in about $700 million of traditional free cash flow. We are fortunate that even after we invest capital for growth, our China, YRI, and U.S. businesses each generate free cash flow. ", "We expect additional cash flow of over $250 million from refranchising proceeds, another $150 million in employee stock option proceeds, and $40 million from sales of surplus property and equipment and other items. When you add it all up, that is over $1.1 billion in available cash. ", "Consistent with our recent task, our stated approach is to give our share back to our shareholders in the form of share buy-backs and a dividend. We believe we received an especially great value in our stock buy-backs this year. During the third quarter alone, we bought back $337 million of stock at an average price of $47.52. Our year-to-date purchases stand at 853 million. For the full year, we expect our diluted share count to decrease by 6%. ", "In summary, we expect 2006 to be another successful financial year for our shareholders because we expect to deliver 2006 EPS of $2.89, or at least 14% growth versus last year, another year of strong cash flow and substantial cash payout to our shareholders, and finally, we expect to continue building long-term value in our international businesses, YRI and China -- YRI, through high return franchise expansion and development of emerging mega-markets like India, Russia, and France, and in China, with high return company restaurant expansion of multiple Yum! brands.", "Yum! clearly has the opportunity and the capability for long-term growth, with annual EPS growth of at least 10% year after year. ", "That is it for me, David, back to you. ", "David C. Novak", "Thank you very much, Rick. It is becoming more and more apparent we are a global growth company with tremendous upside and new unit potential. There is no doubt in my mind that we will have at least 20,000 restaurants in China someday, and we are taking the right steps to put our brands on the map in India, Russia, and continental Europe. ", "We obviously had an excellent third quarter and fabulous year-to-date results. Our China and YRI growth engines are firing on all cylinders. U.S. business has now softened after a string of very strong comps, but we are confident Taco Bell and KFC are in good shape, while we are focused to turn Pizza Hut in the U.S. around. ", "Net net, our international divisions continue to drive our growth and our U.S. business generates substantial, relatively stable cash flow, which we return to shareholders. ", "Before we go to Q&A, we need to make an announcement. As you may have seen, Starbucks recently announced that they are going to provide same-store sales on a quarterly basis versus by month. We have evaluated their move and believe it makes sense for us as well for the following reasons:", "Now, we will be happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Tim Jerzyk", "Are we ready to go, Nicole?", "Operator", "Just one moment. Your first question comes from David Palmer with UBS. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask you about the U.S. business. It seems like September trends for the industry accelerated a bit, but maybe only as much as what the comparisons might have kind of dictated. In other words, the two-year trend did not do anything all that spectacular. ", "I was wondering if you are -- first, if you would comment on the industry environment. Secondly, with regard to Taco Bell and KFC, obviously you have seen an increase in everyday low pricing options out there -- McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s -- and you are talking about how you are pushing up some changes in the KFC product calendar for \u201907. I am wondering if that is causing a bit of soul-searching on those two brands in terms of what foot forward in terms of marketing and menu innovation you put. ", "In other words, do you think you can just leave your menu innovation schedule intact and just go with it, or do you have to change what you are doing? Thanks. ", "David C. Novak", "First of all, in terms of the category, we think the category is basically in the same shape it was three or four months ago. It is a tough category. I think when we look at what could be impacting our business that we did not foresee last year, I think it is the introduction of two chicken products, one of them being the $0.99 sandwich that Wendy\u2019s introduced and the other being the $1.29 chicken wrap that McDonald\u2019s introduced. We do believe that both of those products had impact on KFC and, to a certain extent, had impacted Taco Bell as well, because they are more in the value arena. ", "As we look at our Taco Bell and KFC in particular, we really feel like everything that we are doing on those brands is right in terms of the positioning of the brands, the overall advertising campaigns, and the fact that we continue to have a full-court press on developing product news. ", "I think the way we kind of look at it is while we had a tremendous string of continuous same-store sales growth and our two-year numbers are great, we look at it in the last three months, it has sort of been like we are down 7 to 3 at half-time, so we have kind of gone back into the locker room, we have looked at our game plan, and we really think that the playbook that we have is right, and what we want to do is just make sure that we execute it as strongly as we can. ", "Let\u2019s take Taco Bell, for example. Would we change the advertising? \u201cThink Outside the Bun\u201d is, I think, most people would say it would be right up there with -- it is in the top tier of any advertising campaign in the industry. Then, when we look at our product pipelines at both Taco Bell and KFC, we have a lot of news coming up and so what we are doing now is just trying to decide which news is the most valuable, which news will have the most impact, and we are planning our calendar to really give the consumer as much power as we can. ", "I think what we have learned is that you need more news today to win. We think we are losing more out to other competitors\u2019 product news introductions than on the value front. In other words, we think Wendy\u2019s had more product news with their $0.99 chicken sandwich than we did when we came back and just reinforced the Snacker product that we introduced last year. We think McDonald\u2019s had more news with their $1.29 snack wrap. We think we have been outnewsed. ", "Now, the good news is we have a lot of news at Taco Bell and KFC and we can get back in that game and you will see us play that game well next year. ", "I think the two-year trends are important because it says don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bathwater here. The worst thing we could do is overreact to the business that we have right now, but I could tell you I think I read somewhere where somebody was wondering if we were interested in turning around the U.S. business, and that is so far from the truth it is unbelievable. We are all over this like a fly on honey and we are going to do everything we can to turn this business around. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, David. Next question, please, Nicole. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia with Citigroup. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. Rick, just first a clarifying question. The period ending share count, if you could share that. Also, if you could maybe give a preliminary outlook for commodities in 2007. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "The quarter end share count was 265 -- that is absolute basis shares, 265 million shares. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Okay, thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Commodity, for background for 2006 again, before we get into 2007, is that we had very favorable commodities. We were about $35 million year-to-date, $10 million in the third quarter. We expect positive commodities in the fourth quarter, probably less than the first three quarters. ", "We do not have a great handle yet on 2007. Right now, we are not expecting anything unusual. We will have a lot more to report at our December meeting. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "But it is safe to say that you would likely be flat to potentially slightly up in many cases?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Early indications are what I would call normal low-level inflation. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Okay, thanks. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Glen. Next question, please, Nicole. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. ", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan", "Thanks. The question is actually on China. Obviously the returns for the overall market, and presumably new unit returns, are fairly exceptional, as driven by your sales to investment ratios and specifically the margins that we are seeing reported on your income statement. ", "I guess what I am looking for is, how do you feel about having a 23.7% margin? Is that the level we should be thinking about you making longer term? Is that, for whatever reason, kind of a peak-ish margin in the quarter? Will new units, do you think it would be higher or lower than that? ", "In kind of parenthetical view to that, does it make sense at any point to perhaps lower that margin to make your business even more attractive to more consumers as you expand throughout China?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Good question, John. First of all, the China margins in the third quarter are a bit normal than our full-year numbers, just because of seasonality. So seasonality did drive third quarter above normal, but our year-to-date margins are over 21%. ", "I personally believe that 20% margins are sustainable in China for a few reasons. First of all, as we go to these smaller cities, even though our average sales are below what we are getting in the bigger cities, our margins are actually higher, so those businesses are performing well and our returns are higher there as well. So we feel great about that development. ", "The second piece is our competitive position continues to improve in China. If you really look at it, we have been adding 400 restaurants for the division, but just on the KFC side, close to 300 restaurants the last couple of years, which is three-to-one our nearest competitor. So our power in the marketplace continues to improve and we have been able to leverage that on the cost side. ", "I feel that our margins there are sustainable and, as income grows there, we are already becoming more and more affordable to people. We are expanding our reach as much as we want to, really, because of the income level rising as opposed towards to needing to discount our products. ", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan", "Can I ask you a question just related to food and paper costs in China? It looks like, according to my numbers, that it has dropped about 250 basis points over the last three years. Is that something that you are able to -- is it your distribution efficiencies, is it better purchasing? Is there something going on in that market that should allow that trend to continue?", "Richard T. Carucci", "First of all, I think the reason we have achieved it, John, is what we were talking about earlier, that our purchasing power and the number of units we have continues to increase, so we get more efficiencies as we and our suppliers get bigger supporting us. So there has been natural ability to manage costs. ", "I do expect to continue to see some improvement there, probably not at the rate that we have gotten over the last several years. So we expect that rate of improvement to moderate over time, but we also believe we have the opportunity to take modest pricing over time. Because our cost structure has improved so much, we have taken very limited pricing in China. When we have taken limited pricing, the market has been able to absorb that. ", "David C. Novak", "The other thing, John, to your point earlier about providing value to the customers. We do have over 6,000 transactions a week in KFCs, and the only way we have been able to get to that point is because we have everyday affordable value. We are going to make sure we keep that up. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, John. Next question, please, Nicole. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jeff Omohundro from Wachovia. ", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia Securities", "Thanks, just two questions. First, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your thinking on KFC U.S., the Famous Bowls, where we are on the product cycle on that with the upcoming line extension. Is the mix sustaining? Is that becoming more of a core product? What the outlook is on that. ", "Secondly, if you could remind us, what accounts for the differing performance between mainland China and Shanghai recently?", "David C. Novak", "I will speak first of all to your point about the Famous Bowls. Basically what we are coming back to with the Famous Bowl product is basically a reprise of our national introduction that we had earlier in the year, so it is the same product. ", "The product has been very successful. It has achieved our mix level that we are looking at and we see this as a permanent product on the menu. In fact, we have a number of line extensions in the hopper that are very unique and differentiated versus our original offering that we think will give us some product news. ", "Tim or Rick, do you want to -- ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Jeff, just to clarify, your question was mainland China sales performance versus division China?", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia Securities", "Yes, division China. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Okay. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Again, just for background, China Division includes Taiwan and Thailand. Effectively, the bigger problem we actually had was in Taiwan, where we were lapping very strong performance last year and the market softened this year. ", "We also were down a little bit in Thailand, which had been strong all year, and there is a week of softer sales with the [crew] there, but those sales have pretty much bounced back. ", "We feel those businesses will bounce back, but just will provide a short-term -- probably for about another month or two. ", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia Securities", "Great, thank you very much. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jeff. Next question, please, Nicole. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter", "I was going to ask some questions here on the Pizza Hut Home Service rollout in China. If you could just give us some idea of the pacing of the rollouts you are expecting there, and maybe contrast the returns you get on that business, relative to the KFC store growth in China. ", "David C. Novak", "First of all, we have just basically developed the Shanghai market. We are going to be going -- in November, we have our strategy plan session with the team there in China, and I think we could give you more detail on that after that meeting. We are really not at the point where we would want to talk about that yet. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "In terms of the economic model on Pizza Hut Home Service, it is a much lower investment base, so we are spending a couple hundred thousand, $200,000, $250,000 per unit and its margins are lower than our base on KFC or Pizza Hut business, probably roughly in the 15% range. With those numbers and that investment return, it has very strong returns. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter", "So higher returns than the KFCs?", "Richard T. Carucci", "It is similar but again, it is very early days. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter", "Okay, thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Mark. Next question, please, Nicole. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bear, Stearns. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear, Stearns", "Thank you. Two questions, one on China. As you start opening more in smaller markets and the [AUBs] come down a bit, will you step up the expansion rate to keep the overall top-line growth in the low 20% area? How do you approach that from a planning perspective?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We try to open them as fast as we can, Joe, so we have been moving at a very high rate. I think if you look at it over time, at some point the unit growth rate will have to decline. At that point though, we still believe we will have probably more opportunity for same-store sales growth. Historically, we have really pretty much grown same-store sales with our unit development. It has been at such a high rate and we think over time, we will probably have more of a blend between unit development and same-store sales growth. ", "Having said that, for the next several years, we believe unit growth will still dominate what is driving the growth there. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear, Stearns", "China same-store sales number of 12% in the quarter -- what did that compare to a year ago?", "Tim Jerzyk", "We do not have it handy, Joe. I will have to give you a call back. I guess it was probably flat to up slightly, something in that range. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Again, third quarter last year we still had some of the effects of Sudan Red, so it was probably negative, I would guess, in the third quarter of last year. ", "David C. Novak", "Let\u2019s not guess. We will get back to you. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, we will get back to you. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear, Stearns", "Just one on the U.S. That $250 million number that you are going to reach from refranchising this year, your original two-year number was $300 million, so I am assuming that two-year number is going a lot higher as well. Can you update us on that?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We will have to update you on that in December but yes, it will be higher but we will give you a more precise number. ", "Joseph Buckley - Bear, Stearns", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "There are no further questions at this time. ", "David C. Novak", "Thank you very much for being on the call. We are off to another good year and we are going to finish another good one and we look forward to 2007, look forward to seeing you at our investor conference in December.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin your conference. ", " Tim Jerzyk", "Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that you if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and any future use of the recording.

The information in this conference call related to projections or other forward-looking statements may be relied on subject to the Safe Harbor statement, which is included in our earnings release last night, and may continue to be used while this call remains in the active portion of the company's website at www.yum.com. ", "On our call today you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO and Rick Carucci, our CFO. I will remind you that we will make remarks using the term like-for-like basis. Basically, what we have done is adjusted the prior year for the extra week last year, or the 53rd week for the full year. ", "Also I wanted to give you an update on our investor days coming up for this year. We'll provide that information with an email update coming up soon. But April 4th we'll have the KFC team available in Louisville; August 15th we'll have the Pizza Hut team available in Dallas; September 5th through the 7th we will be in China again, in Shanghai, to meet with the China team. October 30th, a chance to meet with the Taco Bell team in Irvine, and then also we're in the process of arranging a date sometime in October for a YRI day in Dallas. Then December 12 and 13 we'll be in New York with David Novak and Rick Carucci for an update. That will be your chance to meet with the various members of our management team this year. ", "With that we'll have remarks from both David and Rick. Now I would like to turn the call over to David Novak. ", " David Novak", " Okay. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everybody. As you may have seen from our release last night, we reported solid fourth quarter results with operating profit growth on a like-for-like basis of 7%. This capped off a strong year overall with operating profit growth of 12%. For the full year 2006 each of our business segments, including the U.S., contributed to our like-for-like operating profit growth of 12%. China's growth was 37%, YRI's 11%, and 3% in the U.S. ", "Overall this lead to EPS growth of 8% for the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year 2006. I'm pleased to say that this marks our fifth straight year of double-digit EPS growth and meeting our annual commitment to shareholders for at least 10% EPS growth. We have built our business model around delivering this kind of consistency year after year. We believe we can continue to build on our track record given the strength of our global portfolio and unmatched opportunities for global growth. When you add our tremendous global cash generation and high returns, we are even more confident of continuing to build on our growth track record and growing shareholder value. ", "Importantly, we are focused on getting even better at delivering consistent growth in all our businesses around the world. We believe we have a big advantage with our portfolio of brands and businesses and intend to leverage it even more going forward. We have the ability to take best practices from wherever in the world our teams innovate and create exciting new ideas for our customers, and then spread them to all of our brands and businesses around the globe. ", "Now let's look at each of our three businesses. ", "Importantly for 2007, I am pleased to report that we ended 2006 with very strong momentum in our two high growth businesses, China and YRI. Whether you look at top line or bottom line measures, you have to say these businesses ended the year very well. In Mainland China, fourth quarter system sales growth was 29% and YRI's was 11% in local currency terms respectively. This was one of the best quarters of growth YRI has ever had. Importantly, operating profit growth was equally impressive, 31% for the China division and 15% for Yum! Restaurants International. Again, we believe this bodes well for 2007. ", "Clearly, our challenge in the fourth quarter was our U.S. business. Fourth quarter U.S. blended same-store sales declined by 2% for the company business and was flat for the system overall. Additionally, operating profits declined by 8%. Our primary issue in the fourth quarter was the Taco Bell incident in December, which severely impacted sales and profits. Prior to this incident, Taco Bell sales trends were on track with what we had communicated to you in our third quarter earnings call, down slightly. With the negative impact of the last three weeks of December, we ended the quarter down 5% at Taco Bell. ", "Moving into 2007, we remain committed to delivering our full year target of 2% to 3% U.S. blended same-store sales growth and 5% U.S. operating profit growth. Even though we will definitely be challenged by a weak first quarter, given how we ended 2006 and the tremendously positive lap we had in the first quarter of last year, we expect to see this growth in the second half of 2007. Remember, we were up 19% in the U.S. first quarter last year. This tough overlap, coupled with Taco Bell's ongoing sales recovery, makes it tough sledding in the first quarter, but we expect much stronger growth in the second half. ", "Looking at Taco Bell first, we were actually surprised with how rapidly the brand is recovering from significant sales declines in December. But let me be clear, we are still not all the way back, particularly in our northeast US markets. This is compounded by the fact that at Taco Bell we are currently lapping one of our strongest quarters of same-store sales growth in the last five years, plus 8% first quarter last year. However, what gives us comfort is that the strength of the brand with our core users is as strong as it was before the incident. The challenge is to get light users back in our restaurants. I would like to take a moment and recognize our Taco Bell and Yum! team members who very diligently and rapidly worked to solve the issues for our customers, and I personally want to thank all of those involved for their 24/7 efforts. You know, brands can either go forward or back on how they deal with crisis, and our customers have told us we definitely did a good job of restoring confidence. ", "One thing I want to point out to our shareholders and customers is that we have rapidly put in place farm-level testing of lettuce supply to add another level of testing. We are the first company to do this in our industry, to go to this extra level of testing and increasing the safety of our products. Based on what we know today, we believe we can achieve 1% to 2% same-store sales growth at Taco Bell for the year. Hopefully we'll do better, and I know for certain our Taco Bell team is working hard to do better. We are excited about the calendar and innovation that we have in the year ahead, all supported by a very powerful brand, Taco Bell. ", "The new product pipeline is full with some really good products including the new Taquito a great value at $1.79 that was launched with the Super Bowl ads. If you haven't tried these great portable grilled snacks, it offers great value, tastes great, you should go out and buy one today. There will be more great tasting great value items just like the Taquito coming to Taco Bell over the next several months. ", "Before I wrap up on Taco Bell, I want to also add we just had our annual spring training event for franchise and company operators. We are pleased to report that there was record Taco Bell franchise attendance and the mood was upbeat for 2007. Overall we expect Taco Bell's sales growth to improve substantially during the second quarter and into the second half of 2007. ", "At KFC, we finished the fourth quarter down 1% in same-store sales but up 1% for the year. As we mentioned in our last call, we remain very confident of our brand positioning, our advertising, and are very focused on steady improvement in our operations. Additionally, plans for 2007 remain focused on building bigger sales layers around the four new concepts we have launched in the past two years and new ideas later in 2007. These were the best new ideas we had previously targeted for 2008, and last fall decided to pull those forward into the fourth quarter of 2007. ", "You will continue to see new ideas from KFC to grow the concepts of Variety Bucket, Snacker, Flavor Station, and our famous bowls. In addition, some exciting new products and some ideas imported from Yum! Restaurants International. ", "Finally, we continue to expect to have our conversion of zero trans fat completed by the end of April, and believe this will generate positive news. Our tracking says only 30% of our customers are aware of this switch. We continue to expect that KFC will grow same-store sales by 2% to 3% in 2007 with the growth to occur beginning in the second quarter and strongest in the second half of the year. ", "To update you on Pizza Hut, we continue to feel confident of the turnaround that we believe is in process. For the fourth quarter we were down 1% in same-store sales, we are in the transition phase now and expect to see some solid performance as the year progresses. You may have noticed in January when we ran our commercials focused on America's favorite and offered America's favorite pizza, Pizza Hut's Pan Pizza, for a special prize of $10 with any number of toppings. We did this while reinforcing why Pizza Hut is America's favorite versus the top chain competition and communicating that we offer more to the customer in terms of variety of pizzas, amounts of toppings, and innovation. This is based on all of the consumer research we did last year which reinforced for us that Pizza Hut was truly America's favorite brand. It also told us we needed to work on strengthening our everyday value proposition and improving our delivery operations. ", "The fact that we are America's favorite and the fact that we deliver more than our competition is something that we believe will add additional power to our brand over time. Now time will tell on our turnaround, however, and we continue to have confidence in the short and long-term ideas our team is working on. That's about as far as I would like to go without being much more specific for our competitors. We do expect for the full year that will be up 2% to 3% for the year in same-store sales growth. ", "On the development side in the United States, we continue to expect new unit growth to ramp up at Taco Bell. We added plus 1% growth to the system in 2006, and we should be closer to 2% growth in the Taco Bell US system for 2007. The new Bold Choice Taco Bell restaurant design continues to do very well with our customers. Additionally, we are continuing to make progress with both KFC and Pizza Hut systems, expecting several hundred asset upgrades to be completed for each brand in 2007. Importantly, we expect to continue to generate a lot of cash in the United States again this year. And with continued refranchise activity, our US EBITDA after capital expenditures should grow nicely again in 2007. ", "To summarize, then, for the US businesses, we expect to meet our full-year targets for growth in sales and operating profit, and you should expect this will be driven by second half growth. It will be a story of opposites with a weaker first half, and a strong second half of 2007. ", "Now, let's look at the other parts of Yum!. The great and most differentiated news from our Company lies in our two high growth, high return businesses, China, and Yum! Restaurants International. We are truly a global growth company. ", "We expect another outstanding year in China for 2007, driven by our continued rapid development of multiple brands in Mainland China. As of the latest count, we are now in 402 cities in Mainland China with KFC, over 60 cities with Pizza Hut Casual Dining, and expanding into several new cities with broader development of Pizza Hut Home Service. We will also be expanding East Dawning our Chinese food quick service restaurant concept in Shanghai this year to gain scale and consider a TV test down the road. ", "In terms of development in Mainland China, our brands are unmatched by competition, and we do not expect that picture to change for the foreseeable future. We have a huge advantage position unlike anywhere else in the world, particularly for a market of 1.3 billion people, growing personal incomes and the economy at a low double-digit growth rate. ", "For KFC we expect to add nearly 300 new restaurants in Mainland China, which will continue to widen our lead over the nearest competitor, now more than 1,000 units and developing at a 3:1 pace to our nearest competitor. Our brand measures and returns remain very strong and KFC will continue to strengthen further it's QSR dominance in 2007. ", "Our dominant position remains and continues to build for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. Now with over 250 restaurants and growing rapidly, there really is no large competitor in mainland China to speak of in this category. What has been a pleasant surprise is how well our units in the small Tier-3 cities are doing; a great testament to the strength and reach of the brand. We expect to open about 80 new restaurants in 2007, which would actually make our Pizza Hut Casual Dining concept in Mainland China one of the fastest growing casual dining concepts in the world that we know of in terms of significant scale, unit growth rate and absolute openings. For Pizza Hut Home Service, we will begin expansion in more cities to build scale after the successful test in Shanghai during 2006. We expect to add about 20 new Pizza Hut Home Service units in 2007. As I mentioned, we also continue to develop our East Dawning Chinese fast-food concept, which we have very, very high hopes for. ", "You can see we remain very focused against our number one strategy of building dominant brands in China. We have a huge strategic advantage with our local team in place in Shanghai, our own distribution system which continues to improve by utilizing state of the art approaches, and our development team which is producing results that are unmatched by anyone in the country. We continue to expect that our China division will be our lead growth business with 20% growth in operating profit. ", "Now on to Yum! Restaurants International. As I noted earlier, YRI had another really good year in 2006 with operating profit growth of 11%, driven by 9% growth in system sales. This is one of the best years YRI has ever had. Importantly, the business ended 2006 on a strong note, and enters 2007 with solid momentum. It is noteworthy that this strong year was delivered by Yum! Restaurants International despite a not so strong performance from our largest country in market, the United Kingdom. Let's look at where we are in that market, just briefly. I am happy to report that the KFC UK business since midyear last year has been doing extremely well. Our team did an excellent job of assessing their business, the consumer and then leveraged the power of Yum! by identifying what was new and exciting in other areas of the world for KFC. We quickly imported some exciting ideas from Australia and we have never looked back, with same-store sales growth consistently in the double-digit range, bouncing back from previous declines. ", "Our Pizza Hut United Kingdom business has stabilized and is just beginning the turnaround process. We are optimistic the team is on the right path and expect to see improvement as the year progresses. We acquired the remaining 50% interest in the joint venture late last year and have put a new GM and leadership team in place. Overall our UK business should have a better year in 2007. ", "The most important aspect of our Yum! Restaurants International business and achieving its annual 10% profit growth target is the continued development of the many markets around the world by our 700-plus franchisees where we are dominant players in QSR chicken with KFC and family or casual dining with Pizza Hut. We opened 785 new restaurants last year. That's the seventh consecutive year we have opened at least 700 new units. It's interesting to point out that Yum! Restaurants International is now one of the world's most profitable restaurant companies as a standalone entity, with operating profit of more than $400 million. Importantly, we have plenty of room to grow both KFC and Pizza Hut in the markets where we operate and much less competition from U.S. brands. ", "In our YRI markets around the world we have an infrastructure of over 700 franchise partners that are expanding. Last year, our franchisees opened over 90% of our new restaurants. This really highlights the fact that the franchisees are getting solid unit economics in the new restaurants, both KFC and Pizza Hut. Additionally, our existing franchise business is very healthy with 7% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter. ", "The key is that the YRI team has done a great job not only in developing great new product pipelines, but they have also done well with best practice sharing within their worldwide business. As great new ideas are generated in various markets in the world, we are quickly adapting to them by their partners in the rest of YRI's markets. It is not too much of a surprise, then, that as we have really begun to get better and better at best practice sharing, that our YRI sales growth for 2006 was so strong. ", "Most important of all, we continue to have a great operational focus that targets to get better and better with the objective of being the number one brand in terms of consumer preference in all our markets. ", "To summarize, we are confident Yum! Restaurants International will have another great year in 2007, with at least 5% growth in system sales, local currency basis, and 10% operating profit growth. The new unit pipeline remains strong and development of our KFC and Pizza Hut brands will continue in many markets of the world. For the longer term, you should expect us to continue to build big businesses in India, Russia and Continental Europe. ", "Now I'll turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer, who will take you through the numbers in detail. ", " Rick Carucci", " Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. I'm going to review four items today: ", "First, Yum!'s fourth quarter results; ", " Second, Yum!'s full year 2006 results; ", " Third, our 2007 outlook; and ", " Fourth, a brief update of our refranchising program and our full-year cash expectation. ", "Now, let's talk about the fourth quarter, which was a solid quarter for us given the Taco Bell incident. Worldwide operating profit growth was 7% on a like-for-like basis. Quarter 4 EPS was $0.83, up 8% versus last year on a reported basis. Now let's look at Q4 by business segment. ", "Needless to say, our China division had a great quarter with 36% profit growth and 12% same-store sales growth in Mainland China. Restaurant margin was up almost 4 points versus a year ago, and full year margin was over 20%. Importantly, we are generating these kinds of margins while opening about 400 new restaurants for the division. We are very encouraged by this performance. Both the KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining brands in Mainland China has strong sales growth in the fourth quarter. KFC growth was aided by a relatively easy lap versus 2005, which was impacted by the avian flu. ", "You may note that our financials for the China division for the quarter\u2019s G&A increased 50%. This larger than normal increase was primarily driven by continued growth in the business and the people needed for the development of our brands, as well as by higher incentive compensation as a result of a great year. ", "One final point before I leave China division results: the rest of the division, excluding mainland China, is not performing at as high of a level as Mainland China. Our KFC Taiwan and Thailand markets together generated mixed results, and that is why you are seeing a higher sales growth rate in Mainland China than the division. This will likely continue in to 2007. To recap, China division fourth quarter operating profit was up 36%, or up 31% excluding the benefit of favorable currency. ", "Yum! Restaurants International or YRI also had a very strong fourth quarter, with 15% operating profit growth on a like-for-like basis. As David mentioned, this operating performance was lead by very strong sales results, which exceeded our expectations. ", "In addition, restaurant margin performance was solid with an increase of six-tenths of a percentage point. Same-store sales at both company and franchise restaurants increased by 7% for the quarter. As seen in last night's release, the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in our Pizza Hut UK joint venture business had a large and expected impact on YRI results. The primary measures impacted are franchise fees, company sales and operating margins. ", "We now report all the joint venture Pizza Hut restaurants that were previously paying franchise fees as company-owned restaurants. Therefore, franchise fees are reduced and company sales are higher, about 30% higher. With the G&A for the former JV restaurants now included in our P&L, our YRI operating margin was reduced. The impact of the acquisition on these key measures is reflected in the earnings release. To recap, YRI's fourth quarter operating profit was up 11% on a reported basis, or up 15% when you exclude the extra-week benefit last year, and the slightly favorable foreign currency benefit of $2 million. ", "Turning to the US for the fourth quarter, we had slightly negative same-store sales exclusive of the impact from the Taco Bell incident in the last three weeks of the quarter. Overall the Taco Bell incident cost us $20 million in operating profit for the quarter. About half of that amount was from the lost sales, while the remaining portion was for extra consumer research, incremental marketing to get our message out to our customers that we had quickly resolved the issues, and legal and other expenses. Exclusive of this Taco Bell impact, U.S. operating profit for the fourth quarter would have been flat with last year on a like-for-like basis. ", "Restaurant margins were solid given last year's extra week and considering a 2% decline in same-store sales. This was primarily a factor of lower insurance costs reflecting continued favorable loss trends thanks to the good work of our restaurant and safety teams. Lower commodity costs also helped out with over $7 million of favorability primarily from cheese, chicken, and beef. Utilities were also slightly favorable. To wrap up, the U.S. in quarter 4 had a 15% reported decline in operating profit while adjusting it to a like-for-like basis with last year, the decline was 8%. ", "On the financial non-operating side for the fourth quarter, we experienced some positive and negative impacts to EPS. The positive impacts were a significant share buyback which reduced our share count by 5% and a lower tax rate partly due to reversal of reserves related to our regular US audit cycles. The negative impacts were an $8 million increase in interest expense due to higher rates and additional borrowing, higher closure and impairment expenses, up $15 million versus last year; and a refranchising gain of $17 million, which represents a $5 million reduction versus last year's gain. Together these non-operating items increased fourth quarter EPS by $0.01, so they mostly offset each other. ", "Yum!'s full year 2006 EPS was up 14% versus prior year, exceeding our target of at least 10% growth. Importantly, it was a high quality year with operating profit up 9% on a reported basis, and 12% excluding the benefit of an extra week last year. Importantly, all three businesses contributed to this growth. ", "The restaurant margin improvement was very good with a 1.2 percentage point gain worldwide and an increase in all three businesses. Our operating margin improved one full point worldwide and also improved in all three businesses. Top line performance was solid with worldwide system sales growth of 5% on a like-for-like basis. This result was driven by strong YRI and China performances. ", "We opened over 1,500 new restaurants around the world including over 700 by our YRI franchisees and 364 in Mainland China. We opened 137 new Taco Bell restaurants in the US, and net Taco Bell restaurant growth was plus 1%. We reduced US company ownership to 23% of the system from 26% at year end 2005, by refranchising 452 restaurants. For YRI we continue to refine our ownership in some markets and refranchised 168 restaurants. Our Pizza Hut UK acquisition resulted in a temporary increase in YRI company ownership. The net of the YRI refranchising and the shift of the Pizza Hut UK business to company ownership, increased YRI's company ownership of the system to 15% at year end, from 12% last year. ", "Yum! again had strong tax performance with an annual rate of 25.6%, slightly better than last year. The rate was also slightly better for the year than our range provided. The tax rate was positively impacted by adjustments to prior year's reserves and accruals. We have not yet changed our tax guidance for 2007, this range remains at 26% to 28%. ", "We invested $614 million in our businesses for maintenance and growth capital. This level has held steady in the $600 million to $650 million range for six years. With this level of capital investment, we were still able to generate $1.1 billion of free cash available. We returned this all to shareholders, with $1 billion of share buybacks and our regular dividend. Hopefully you will agree that 2006 demonstrated some key themes from Yum!: consistent financial performance, impressive global growth and strong cash generation. ", "With 2006 in the books, let's quickly cover our 2007 outlook. Our growth model remains unchanged from what we presented to you at our investor conference this past December in New York. The model includes 20% operating profit growth from our China division, 10% operating profit growth from YRI, and 5% operating profit growth from our US business. This adds up to 9 to 10% growth in operating profit. At our investor conference this past December we pointed out that the US business was already facing a challenge in the first quarter, lapping a huge first quarter in 2006, with 19% operating profit growth and 4% growth in same-store sales. ", "The new news is we are in the midst of recovery at Taco Bell. The timing of the Taco Bell recovery will impact our overall US business. Therefore, we are confident in a strong second half of the US business after a weak first quarter and a transitional second quarter. We still believe that when taken together, the four quarters will add to the 5% operating profit growth target for the year. Based on the growth model we outlined earlier, we are confident we will again meet our annual commitment for at least 10% EPS growth or at least $3.21 per share. ", "Let's now discuss refranchising and 2007 cash flow expectations. We detailed for you our refranchising plan at our recent New York investor conference, and we summarized this plan again in the release last night. Our target is to reach about 17% ownership of the overall US system by year end 2008. This will be achieved primarily through refranchising activity at Pizza Hut, Long John Silver's and KFC. Consistent with our earn the right to own principles, expect to see very little refranchising at Taco Bell where our margins are very strong. Over next two years you should expect to see continued proceeds from refranchising, increases in US franchise fees, positive impacts to U.S. restaurant margin and operating margin, positive impacts to Yum! ROIC and less demand on capital expenditures from the US business. ", "We believe we made good progress in refranchising in 2006 by refranchising 452 U.S. restaurants. Still, we remain confident of reaching our three-year plan target. I will mention, however, that it is very difficult to accurately predict the timing of when deals will actually be completed and I would not look at one quarter's results to identify a trend. We will do this the right way for our brand, our operators, our franchisees and our customers. ", "On the YRI side for 2007, you should expect to see some pick-up in new activity as the year progresses. We will begin to refranchise our Pizza Hut UK restaurants and bring our effective ownership levels back down to the range it was when the JV was in operation, about 40% company-operated. We expect this will take us through 2009. You can continue to expect us to take a hard look at our company ownership each year, using our earn the right to own principle as a guiding force. ", "In 2007 you should expect another year of a strong balance sheet and substantial levels of free cash available for payout to our shareholders. We expect to return even more cash in 2007, or about $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2006. I will remind you that our quarterly dividend will double to $0.30 with our second quarter payment as we announced last December. This will provide a more balanced payout to our shareholders. In 2007, we expect a 3% to 4% reduction in our share count due to share buybacks. ", "So to wrap up, we expect another successful year for our shareholders, generating consistent financial performance, impressive global growth and strong cash flow. Back to you, David. ", " David Novak", " Thank you very much, Rick. Just to kind of repeat here a little bit. As you look this year, first our global portfolio will lead us to another year of consistent -- at least 10% -- EPS growth. Second you can expect global growth with 1,500 new store openings around the world. Last but not least, each of our businesses will generate free cash flow, giving us the global capability to return $1.3 billion to our shareholders, allowing us to reduce our share count significantly once again and pay an above-market dividend of approximately a 2% yield. So, our company is very strong. We are excited about 2007, and we welcome any questions that you have. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch. ", " Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch ", "Could you give the thinking behind why the poison pill was removed from the bylaws and why the change to the board member election process? What was the impetus for that? ", " David Novak", " I think the board just stepped back and looked at all of our governance principles and just felt that this would better serve our shareholders over time. So I wouldn't read anything in to it other than that. ", " Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch ", " Do you also have the traffic mix and change in average check for us on the U.S. brands? ", " Rick Carucci", "Taco Bell was negative 5 in transactions, basically flat in check. Pizza Hut was down 2 in transactions, and up 1 and a fraction in check. KFC was down 1 in transactions, slight in check. ", " Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch ", " The breakout in revenue contribution from the brands? ", " Rick Carucci", " If you give us a call after the call this morning, we'll go through that with you. ", " Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch ", "My last question is on the multi-branding, why have we seen a deceleration in growth? I believe you had a 550 target for the year, can you give some color on why the unit growth fell behind expectations? ", " David Novak", " First of all, let me talk about where we did have the multi-brand growth because the mix was probably different than it was several years ago. The multi-branding growth that we had, the primary driver is Pizza Hut and Wing Streets, which is different than several years ago. Then the other driver, which is probably the most important combination for us on a go-forward basis, is Taco Bell and KFC. The Taco Bell/KFC combination is important for us because we think it can get us into new trade zones that we're not currently in, in terms of rural areas, which we have reconcentrated in 2006, and going forward both rural areas and in large metro expensive areas. ", "The reduction that you have seen versus several years ago would have been in the Long John Silver, A&W standalone combinations. We had hoped that would be a big driver of new unit development. We have had mixed success with those, so we slowed those down in terms of new unit development. ", "What will happen as well on a go-forward basis, is that KFC has a contractual commitment, as we mentioned earlier, to upgrade their system by June 2008. We think that will add some more multi-brand combinations as franchisees go to update their restaurants, some of them will want to do either LGS/ KFC combinations or KFC/A&W combinations. ", " Rick Carucci", "The only thing I would just add to this just strategically is when you look at what is going on in the United States in terms of rising real estate costs and just the difficulty it is to open new units, when we look at the quick-service restaurant category, we have come to the conclusion we really need to focus on new unit development with Taco Bell, which is obviously a growing brand and improving unit economics every year. ", "But also Taco Bell and KFC because together when you bring those two brands you have got national scale in terms of advertising that gets us higher volumes and allows us to really go in with the kind of sales levels that we think we can penetrate new markets with. ", "The other big multi-branding strategy is to really change the game for Pizza Hut with the Wing Street addition, which we're having very, very good success with our restaurant-based delivery unit. So, our franchisees are getting more and more excited about that and we're looking how we can scale up there. ", "When we look at Long John Silver and A&W, our franchisees have had good success with both of those brands, but when we think about the real challenge there, the challenge is to build the strength of those brands first before we multi-brand a lot further, and we think we have a lot of work to do in that area as we go forward. ", "So the big strategy we have in quick-service restaurants is to leverage our two power brands which gives us the highest sales, which is KFC and Taco Bell; and in the casual dining delivery arena for Pizza Hut, we think Wing Street gives us a differentiating edge. We really decided to hone in on those two and continue to develop the A&W and Long John Silver concept to strengthen those brands. ", " Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch ", " Is there a 2007 target for multi-branding? ", " Rick Carucci", "Victoria, I think it's in the several hundred range. ", " Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch ", " Is that 400 or 300? ", " Rick Carucci", " I don't have the details with me. You can call us later, and we can give you the details. ", " Victoria Heart - Merrill Lynch ", " Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Larry Miller - RBC Capital. ", " Larry Miller - RBC Capital", "I was wondering, you have done so well in some other markets, as you see with Earn the Right to Own, reducing our equity, have you given consideration to maybe being more aggressively refranchising the U.S. business so that it has the same kind of cash flows that you get in the franchise-only international market. I know Taco Bell is doing well, but maybe even going to zero with Taco Bell? How did you come up with 17%? If you can just put some color around that idea. Thank you. ", " David Novak", " First of all our strategy is Earn the Right to Own. So any restaurant that we own we want to earn well above the cost of capital. So the restaurants that we're running today by and large really meet that criteria. ", "The second thing is that we believe that we need to own at a minimum at least 10% of our system just to lead our system in the sense of being able to have control of our own destiny in terms of test markets for new products so that we can lead the way. The last thing you want to do is a franchiser is have to beg for the right to test things. We think with at least 10% of the system we'll have enough ownership be able to have the right number of test markets, and certainly we can run 10% of our restaurants at a minimum with the kind of returns that are well above the cost of capital. ", "Right now we're at 17%. Do we look at U.S. franchising? The answer is absolutely yes, we look at it every quarter, every year strategically, just as we do with our international. That's the philosophy we have all around the world. If we're going to run stores, we have to get great returns. ", " Larry Miller - RBC Capital", " Thank you. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from John Glass - CIBC. ", " John Glass - CIBC Markets", "I was hoping you could maybe put a little more framework around Taco Bell sales trends, maybe where they bottomed in December, and where are they now, or at least what kind of magnitude of improvement? And then in your 1% to 2% comp assumption for the year, are you assuming they remain negative in the first half? Maybe some help there too, please. ", " Rick Carucci", " On the Taco Bell sales we disclosed everything that we intend to disclose. We gave you the point at which we had the lowest or the biggest decline which was the third week in December, and the recovery has begun since then. Then we also gave you a pretty good outlook on the year almost by quarter. The next data point will that 5% decline in sales for the fourth quarter, and the next data point will be first quarter. ", " John Glass - CIBC Markets", "If I could ask a question on the margins on China. I knew profits grew strong but you were lapping a very easy comparison from a margin perspective and you saw some pressure on both the payroll and occupancy lines. Are these signs of inflation in China or are they simply some one-time or some growth-related pressures? Could you define what our expectations for where restaurant margin ought to be, given the fourth quarter, going forward? ", " Rick Carucci", " First of all we are obviously very pleased with our China performance for the fourth quarter and for the year. If you look at the China division, as we mentioned earlier, the full-year margin was over 20% and that's for the division which includes Thailand and Taiwan, which had slightly lower margins, so we're very happy with where China margins are right now. ", "In terms of inflation, if you see how our model has worked in China from a margin standpoint, what has occurred is we have had reductions in cost of sales and increases in cost of labor, which pretty much offset each other over time. We probably expect that trend to continue. At some point we're probably not going to get as high of reduction on cost of goods as we have gotten over the past. We have also taken very little pricing in China. So, when we have taken some modest pricing, we haven't faced an issue with the customer. So the mix may change a little bit as we go forward, but the general trends we have had will continue. ", " David Novak", " Just to do a little bit of a cock-a-doodle-doo here for our China team. We ended the year with record margins, 20.4%. So we're very pleased. One of the thing that's I'm really proud of in terms of our China development is we're trying to stay ahead of where the puck is going, so we are making investments strategically in people, and the fact that we have always stayed ahead on people capability, I think is one of the reasons why we're building such a power brand. ", "Remember the cash investment for our new units is about $450,000 on sales of $1 million, and we literally have a one-and-a-half year cash-on-cash return on this business in terms of our new units. So anyway you look at China, you are looking at an economic power house, and that's because our consumer brands are so well received there, and we have been investing in the people capability to make sure that we operate well. That's going to be our strategy as we go forward. ", " Rick Carucci", " Just to add one more point, John, because you can see we're very proud of our China margins, depending on what you're looking at, if you look at Q4 for China division two years ago, if you remember we did change the timing of the reporting for China, we moved it forward to concurrent with the U.S. As a result that had an impact on the fourth quarter by moving the month of August from Q4 to Q3 which had a profit impact of shifting margin favorability and profit to Q3 from Q4. So if you are looking back at that that's one of the reasons. ", "The other thing is, is you got to keep in mind that in terms of labor inflation there was a modest amount, just like about four-tenths of a point, but we also continued to have favorability in food cost, with lower beverage cost and just favorable efficiencies versus last year. ", "Also, you have to keep in mind that we opened a lot of restaurants in the fourth quarter. We're opening up almost 400 a year, and when you open up new restaurants, you also have start-up costs, and that's in that margin. ", " John Glass - CIBC Markets", " That's very helpful. Thank you. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Steve Kron - Goldman Sachs. ", " Steve Kron - Goldman Sachs", "First, on the acquired units, Pizza Hut units from Whitbread. I guess you guys set a timetable for refranchising those stores by year end '09. My question is since this business in the UK is in a bit of a recovery mode here, does this timetable reflect difficulties in attracting franchisee's or is this kind of the normal pacing that you would expect? ", " Tim Jerzyk", " Our experience has been that refranchising is something you want to not go too fast, not go too slow. We feel we'll have very strong demand for our franchise units. We have a history of franchising delivery units in the U.K., and we have always been able to find strong demand for those. Over time our dine-in businesses have been very strong performing businesses, so we expect to have a lot of interest in that, and we already have interest; a lot of calls, a lot of people interested in it. So we're quite confident we'll be able to get the interest, and what we want to do is make sure we have the right franchisees, the right pacing and sequencing, and also do it be the right geographical areas so that we can be efficient with what's left on the company side as well efficiency for franchisees. ", "But three years to me, Steve, is a good timetable. If you just look at the math, we're about 80%; getting to 40% over three years is a pretty good clip. ", " David Novak", " Strategically we're very excited about the Pizza Hut business in the U.K.. I just had a conversation with Alistair Murdoch who is our new general manager there regarding the franchising. One of the great things when you have the kind of cash that we generated at YUM!, we don't need to rush to bring in the money, and I encouraged him to take a look all of the franchisees who are looking to come in to our business and make sure we get the right ones, and not to rush on this. So I think the three-year timeframe is something we can definitely do the right thing for the business strategically on. ", " Steve Kron - Goldman Sachs", "My second question is on the balance sheet. Rick, you have talked about this in the past, but I just wanted to get updated thought on leverage. Certainly you guys have increased a bit of leverage here in '06. Interest expense has gone up. As we move forward and we think about '07 and you continue to drive a higher franchise mix in units, what should our expectations be on the kind of debt front? ", " Rick Carucci", " Well, I'll answer first and transfer it to our new Treasurer. Some of you I'm sure have seen that Tim Jerzyk in addition to being head of Investor Relations is now also our Treasurer. I think our philosophy, to your point, Steve, is the same. Is that, we have worked very hard to pay our debt down. This is a history lesson for some of the other people; from $4.7 billion, we got it down to $1.7 billion, and this year we're at the $2.3 billion level. So we're starting to increase our debt and our current philosophy is to increase the debt consist with our ability to continue to raise cash. So we'll probably continue to see modest increases in our debt level, but now, like I said, I'll let you hear from our Treasurer. ", " Tim Jerzyk", " It's hard to add to that I have always believed our strategies are very good. I think what we're doing is very good in terms of our balance sheet and making sure we have a strong balance sheet. Certainly there's many things going on in the marketplace, and we're always going to be looking at what is out there and learn what we can do best and take advantage of that, but we like what we're doing in terms of returning more cash to our shareholders than our income level each year and taking up our debt steadily each year.

", " Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Could we get a little more detail on the expansion plans for the China home-service business? Just wondering if you could address the pace of development of that concept? How is this transitioning from test to a full roll out? Thank you. ", " Rick Carucci", " Well, in terms of what we have done so far with Pizza Hut home services, we mostly we haven't gone to a lot of cities yet, and what we tried to do is more build out cities, which given delivery trade zones, makes some sense. It's hard to have one delivery unit. So, you saw the numbers in the release, we now have 37 Pizza Hut home-service units. I think the majority of those are in Shanghai. The key is as we go to other cities, we're starting to go there now to try to replicate that model. What you'll see us do is to go to city by city and not go to a lot of cities yet. We'll probably go to a handful of cities between five and ten cities over the next year or so and try to build those out before we go down to the next year. ", " Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", " Thanks. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns. ", " Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns ", "Could you give us a little more color on the China division and how KFC Taiwan and Thailand play in to it? Are those company-operated markets, franchise markets? I know in the past you have given us relative size from time to time. ", " David Novak", "I'll just try to put some dimension, Joe, and tell me if this answers it. First of all, in terms of number of units, Thailand and Taiwan together have about 500 units, a little bit more than that. It's KFC Taiwan, and Thailand for both brands. KFC Taiwan is mostly a company-owned business. We have some franchise business, but predominantly company. The bigger business is Thailand, who probably has about three-quarters of those 500 units, and they are about two-thirds company, and one-third franchise. Together if you look at a profit standpoint, those two markets for 2006 probably contributed about 10% to the China division profit level. ", " Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns ", "A question on the US operating profits, if I look back to the December presentation, you pretty much hit the number in terms of full-year US operating profits, but that was with, as you described, a $20 million hit at Taco Bell. What were the other moving parts there that made that up? ", " Rick Carucci", " Well, I think what we said in our last release is we would go between 3% and 5% operating profit for the US for the full year, so we were near the bottom of that range. What will help is some of the margin things that I talked about in my speech, is we ended up doing well on some of our insurance costs. We did probably a little better than what we expected on commodities, and utilities were slightly favorable versus earlier in the year when the utilities were slightly working against us. So those were some of the key drivers, we did probably a little bit better on margin than what we thought and obviously we weren't expecting a sales decline. ", " Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns ", " Just one more question, back to China. I think you mentioned Mainland China openings of 364 units. For the division did you make the 400 number that you were targeting? ", " Rick Carucci", " I think the final number was 396, Joe, so just about 400. ", " Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia - Citigroup. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "I was hoping maybe you can help me here. The comment was made that you had a hard time attracting light users to come back to Taco Bell. I'm curious if you can give us a break down of Taco Bell sales between core users and light users, and then the implication if Taco Bell is 1% to 2% for the year and Pizza Hut and KFC are 2% to 3% same-store sales for the year, the implication is you are at the bottom end of that full-year 2% to 3% range, if I'm reading that correctly. ", " David Novak", " Well, let me take the second part. I'm not sure if we can give you much exact information on the first part of your question, Glen. Regarding the US sales level, again, we're in February, trying to look at what we were. But yes, basically, just to reiterate, yes, we said 2 to 3 on KFC and Pizza Hut and 1 to 2 on Taco Bell so if you add that up that's over 2. So, that's where we are today. But, again, like I said we're in February. So when we have more information I'll share that. ", " Tim Jerzyk", " I don't have the exact numbers, but the Taco Bell user base is driven primarily from the core users, not the light users. But I think the challenge is to get those light users back in. ", " David Novak", " Losing those takes a little bit of the fun out of your business, okay? But the great news is that all of our consumer tracking says that we are on track, and we think we'll weather this and move forward. And like I said earlier, we're pleasantly surprised by the recovery. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "One quick follow-up, I believe in the initial 2007 guidance, given at the time of the analyst's day, interest expense for the full year was guided to be up about $10 million versus 2006. Rick, does that still hold or Tim as Treasurer, does that still hold given that you are talking about perhaps modestly increasing the debt as we move through the year? ", " Tim Jerzyk", " Yes, we're still good with that guidance, $10 million is a good number for this year. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", " Thanks. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "First on the U.S. costs, specifically food and occupancy. On the food we have seen pretty significant favorability over the last two years in the US, I think some modest pressure in '07. Wondering if you can give us an update on where you stand in terms of the key commodity cost line items and the impact of recent pressure on wheat? ", "Separately, US occupancy cost pressures have been significant through all of '06. Just wondering what the driver of the pressures are and what your outlook is for that for '07 as well. ", " David Novak", " Let me first start on the commodities side. We have really no change in overall outlook on the commodities. We guided in December 2% to 3% commodity cost increase versus 2006 with chicken about 1%, which we still see that holding as best we can tell. So we really don't have a change in to the commodity guidance at this point. ", "Regarding labor, what we assumed for the year was that we would have about a 3% increase in labor. First of all there were some state minimum wage increases already assumed in that number, and we were assuming if federal minimum wage did occur would occur in the middle of the year with a fairly modest impact to us for '07. ", " Tim Jerzyk", " Jeff, I think you asked about wheat that was already included in the forecast and wherever it impacts us in Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, On the occupancy side, you asked about that in the U.S. on the upside, what are the factors, there's really not one particular factor. In fact, for the fourth quarter, if you look at it, there was a lot of different things going up a little bit for the fourth quarter in particular. For example, there was some modest inflation in property taxes, rent, advertising was a little bit higher, repair and maintenance was a little bit higher, and what we call semi-variables which was day-to-day; other store expenses was up modestly. So it was a lot of little things up a little bit, nothing in particular that you would say is a trend. In fact utilities were actually a little bit favorable. ", " Rick Carucci", "Just to build on that the biggest impact on that line about a half of point was marketing, and that relates to what we mentioned earlier on the Taco Bell side, trying to get our message out as quickly as we could given our December situation. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", " Just following on your comments, a little pressure on food costs and labor going forward. Just wondering if you could talk about the current environment pricing? Can you take some more menu pricing being more aggressive without negatively impacting traffic> With those type of cost pressures in terms of G&A, how should we think of that in terms of dollar growth or as a percentage of revenues, especially if you actively engage in refranchising? Thanks. ", " David Novak", " It's something we definitely continue to look at, so there's several things we're looking at. One is probably just good business practice, but we probably got more focus on it in the last year, just looking at what the inflation environment could be, because we put a lot more pressure on ourselves in terms of productivity. We're looking at productivity and cost design and we're even looking at what types of products do we try to get innovation around and then also looking at true cost efficiency. We'll continue to put a lot of pressure on ourselves on the productivity side. ", "Regarding pricing, we took modest price increases essentially at the beginning the year, we'll continue to look at that and to see if we should look at small increases in the middle of the year. We obviously are looking at what the competition is doing. We seem to see a little bit more pricing occurring this year than in previous years, so we'll continue to keep our eye on that. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Banc of America Securities. ", " Andy Barish - Banc of America Securities", "On the YRI 10% profit growth for this year, anything implicit or unusual in the big equity markets? UK obviously excluding the Whitbread; Mexico or Korea, any improvements or deterioration in any of those markets assumed? ", " David Novak", " Not really. We're pretty much looking for trends. Obviously we want to improvement markets that didn't perform as well, so, the UK had a weak year in 2006, especially in the first half of the year. Korea had a weak 2006, so clearly, we want to try to improvement performance in those areas. Mexico had a strong 2006 and ended the year with strong momentum, so we're not expecting huge shifts in that business other than the recovery in the UK that we previously talked about. ", "Operator", " Your next question is a follow-up from Larry Miller - RBC Capital. ", " Larry Miller - RBC Capital", " My question was answered. Congratulations, Tim. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Reese - JP Morgan. ", " Steve Reese - JP Morgan", "I just wanted to ask about the overall pizza segment in the US. It seems like the overall category was pretty weak last year and we saw a lot of value promotions, as well as some more differentiated promotions, so I just wanted to get an update from you what your thinking of the strategy is in 2007? ", " David Novak", "I think the category has been soft. Our strategy is to continue to lead with pizza innovation, develop a stronger everyday value marketing approach, which we're working very aggressively on and then continue to improve our operations just in terms of delivering the basics in terms of speed of service, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, where we think we're leaving a lot of volume on the table, just because we're not serving as many customers that are actually trying to access Pizza Hut. I think finally is to change the game in the economic model through the leveraging of the Wing Street brand, which we think can bring some vitality to the business. Those are the four things that we're working on, and, I think, that we're very optimistic about having a much better year at Pizza Hut this year. ", " Steve Reese - JP Morgan", " As you look back over last year, do you think you could have had more value or do you think the value needs to play a bigger role this year? ", " David Novak", " I think last year we wish we would have had more compelling innovation. I think that would have had a bigger impact on our business, than just out and out value. I think that how you go against value, it has to be done from both an innovation standpoint, not just taking your prices down. So that's what we're go working on. I can't go through all of the details on this, I think taking your pricing down, and not getting a whole lot of credit for it is like a formula for disaster in the category, and it seems like when any of us do it, it doesn't do a whole hell of a lot of good for any one of us. We try to be a lot smarter on how we discount than just giving our pizzas away. ", " Steve Reese - JP Morgan", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer - UBS. ", "  David Palmer - UBS", "Could you give any early feedback on Taco Bell breakfast tests, and the potential timetable if the tests go well? I guess you are testing it in southern California, for instance, could that be an early '08 type roll out? ", " David Novak", "Where we're at right now is we have basically done our in-store operations test. We're now moving in to a few markets. The only early feedback I can give you is we know that the consumers love our products, and how we stage this will depend on the learnings that we get in our test market. I think we really think that Taco Bell can change the game with breakfast in the category, because we certainly have a think outside the bun breakfast. ", "  David Palmer - UBS", "I have two questions on same-store sales disclosure. With regard to US same-store sales growth by brand is the drill going forward going to be that we're going to find out during the conference call, and you are not going to disclose that in the release? If so, why not just disclose it in the release? ", " Tim Jerzyk", " That's a valid point, David. I think the way we viewed this quarter was same-store sales for the blended, which we think is the appropriate measure for our business, given that we have three brands, and that we have the advantage of the portfolio, given that we were down 2% in the fourth quarter, we identified to you the driving force of that, which was Taco Bell being down 5% and the other two brands were, if you excluded that were basically identical in terms of the results. That's how we thought a about it. We'll certainly take your thoughts into consideration going forward. ", " David Novak", "How we look at all of those is, what makes our Company unique? You know, what really are our key measures? When you look at it, we're very different than almost any restaurant company in the world. We have a global portfolio; blended sales are much more important us to than it would be to Jack-in-the-Box. We have got China. That's why we separated that business out. Nobody else has China. So now we have a separate division, which is primarily made up of Mainland China, so that really allows us to report on something that really makes us uniquely different. ", " Obviously YRI is a business that is unlike any other in the world as well. So when you look at our business, it's China, the new unit growth in China, the 20% operating profit growth. It's YRI, it's the new unit growth there, we're doing over 700 restaurants a year, 10% operating profit growth. When you look at the U.S., you are looking at blended same-store sales measure, because that's what really differentiates us as a company and you are going to be looking at 5% operating profit growth. So those are our targets, that's what we try to report, and that's what we want to get people focused on. ", "  David Palmer - UBS", " I guess, just harping on the topic, China same-store sales growth might be something that you would want to perhaps phase in given the rising importance there. Is that something you might consider starting to report in the near future? ", " Tim Jerzyk", " China same-store sales growth is in the earnings release, and it has been in there every quarter and it's our plan to include that going ahead for Mainland China. ", " David Novak", " My personal opinion is what you should really be looking at is system sales growth, because how many people have a unit base like we have that are opening up 400 restaurants a year? So I think the real measure there is our profit growth, our unit growth, and system sales growth. ", "We're trying to focus and get investors to hone in on what really makes us unique, and what really makes our company different than the other companies. I have always said as you know, for the last five years we're not your ordinary restaurant company, so we're not going to report ourselves like the ordinary restaurant company. ", "Operator", " There are no further questions at this time. Do you have any closing remarks? ", " David Novak", " Yes, I do. First of all, I want to thank everybody for being on the call. I just want to close by saying we're optimistic about the year. One of the things we're very proud of is our track record, and we think that our global portfolio will allow us to continue our record of consistency and we expect to achieve at least 10% earnings per share growth. ", "We're also very proud of the fact that we develop a lot of restaurants around the world, so you can expect more global growth with 1,500 new stores opening around the world. The other thing that makes us very unique that I did not mention is just the fact that we do generate a lot of free cash flow, and each one of our businesses generate free cash flow when you look at the US, China, Yum! Restaurants International, that gives us the global capability to return $1.3 billion to our shareholders. Once again, we're going to be reducing our share count significantly, and remember, in December, we doubled our dividend, so now we'll be able to pay an above-market dividend or approximately a 2% yield. ", "So, this company is very excited about this year and our future, and we are very committed to continuing to drive home the kind of consistency that I think we'll get rewarded for in the market.

My name is Megan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Jerzyk, you may begin your conference. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Megan and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website at www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and any future use of the recording.

", "On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following the remarks from both of those people, we will take your questions. Now I will turn the call over to David Novak. ", "David C. Novak", "Thank you, Tim and good morning, everybody. As you may have seen from our release last night, we reported outstanding first quarter results with operating profit growth of 12% and EPS growth of 19%. This quarter is yet another example of the power of our global portfolio to deliver growth. ", "The fact that we delivered this great performance in the face of negative and unforeseen incidents at Taco Bell shows the tremendous earning power of our company. ", "The strong trends of 2006 for both our China and YRI businesses have continued into 2007 and we continue to expand our brands in many countries around the world, building on our leading global growth track record. ", "I am pleased to report that on the strength of our global growth, we have raised our full-year EPS forecast to at least 11% growth, or $3.23 per share, from 10% previously. ", "You may recall that we said in our last quarter earnings call, we believe that Taco Bell was well on the recovery path from an E-coli issue in December when we were dealt a second blow with adverse publicity related to the rodent incident at one of our KFC/Taco Bell restaurants in New York. Believe me -- it was very painful for our dedicated team members and all of us who love our brand so much to see the video that went over the Internet. It did not matter that it was shot at 3:00 a.m. in the morning when the restaurant was closed and the franchisee was trying to fix the problem. That was the intent but the reality is it should have never happened and we take full accountability. ", "We have taken aggressive actions to remedy the issue and make sure that it does not happen again. We have provided the full details in the release last night. ", "Given our strong and loyal consumer franchise, we are extremely confident that there will not be an adverse long-term impact to the Taco Bell brand. In these situations, it usually takes six months or so to fully recover from food safety type issues. In this case, we expect to see steady improvement for the balance of the year from Taco Bell. Essentially, we have to give time, time. ", "Now let\u2019s look at the overall U.S. business and talk about what we are doing to drive same-store sales and profit growth. Despite recent softness in the U.S., our expectation is for steady improvement balance of year and positive profit performance overall for the year, but below our long-term earnings target of plus 5%. ", "Last December at our investor conference, we talked about the fact that we look at the U.S. business as a tremendous opportunity to leverage the capacity of our existing assets, our 20,000 plus restaurants across our three big brands. ", "When we look at our top 10% performing restaurants in terms of sales volume, we find that they are about double the volume typical for the rest of the system. From this analysis, it is clear we have no capacity constraints in our restaurants. ", "Overall, the key long-term themes and our focus for improving upon how we are targeting to better leverage the existing 20,000 restaurants we have in the U.S. are: number one, add more balanced meals and choices for our customers, then expand into multiple day parts, broaden our protein offerings, create destination desserts and beverages, and ensure we have a solid positioning in everyday value, and finally, develop system-wide contemporary assets, including multi-branding, on a focused basis. ", "Importantly, we have not yet capped all the day parts available to our brands, particularly breakfast, and important menu variety like destination desserts and drinks. We are aggressively working against these key opportunities for the longer term at each brand, which we believe can add between $100,000 to $300,000 in sales to each restaurant over time. ", "In the short-term for 2007, at Taco Bell we are introducing new products like the Steak Taquito just recently, and we now are offering a limited time version of our very successful Crunchwrap which we launched in 2005. This new version is the 7-layer Crunchwrap, a great flavor variation of the highly successful original version. There will be more product news balance of the year. ", "We will continue to emphasize Taco Bell value for our core customers and will continue to communicate our fourth meal message to enhance our late night business. ", "Right now, we are testing breakfast in four Taco Bell markets. The products on the breakfast menu are delicious and Taco Bell\u2019s position as an exciting flavor alternative for QSR breakfast. ", "Additionally, we are aggressively developing a line of Mexican-inspired beverages to bring to test market. ", "At KFC, I am pleased that we are now moving to zero trans-fats to provide an even better way to enjoy our core chicken products. We just began advertising this significant change. Coming up, we have a line extension of last year\u2019s quick-service restaurant product of the year, KFC's Famous Bowls. Beyond that, we will continue to focus on variety and complete meals in a value context. ", "Additionally, as the year progresses, KFC will begin to steadily expand into late night hours. ", "In order to give our customers more choices, we are in the process of testing a great non-fried chicken-on-the-bone product to complement our great original recipe and extra crispy chicken. ", "Finally, KFC is also testing shakes and other desserts. ", "At Pizza Hut, you may have seen our recent commercials to support the launch of our new hand-tossed pizza. The product has clear taste superiority over our two national competitors\u2019 core pizza products. ", "Additionally for Pizza Hut, we are being much more targeted with our price value offerings and actually reducing some of our local discounting. Long-term, we are continuing to work on leverage our Pizza Hut/WingStreet multi-brand combination and to scale the opportunity for both our delivery carry-out units as well as our dine-in locations. ", "To summarize overall for the U.S., we expect 2007 to be a tale of two cities, with a poor first-half and a solid second-half. ", "I can assure you we know we can do better and we will. Remember the U.S. has generated on average operating profit growth of 2% and EBITDA growth of 3% for the past five years, and we are on track for a similar type of year in 2007. We will continue to have this as our cash flow foundation as we work aggressively to put in place multiple ways to better leverage our assets and consistently achieve our 5% target. We definitely believe the U.S. is an opportunity for Yum! Brands and we are in hot pursuit of it. ", "Emil Brolick, President of U.S. Brand Building, is leading this charge and like me, is confident you will see steady progress. ", "The good news is that our high returning growth engines, China and YRI, each had blockbuster first quarter performances. The great and most differentiated news from our company lies within these two high growth, high return businesses. ", "I came back from China this past week and I could tell you first hand, we are confident of another outstanding year in China in 2007. Importantly, it will be driven by our rapid and continued rapid and substantial development of multiple brands in mainland China. As of the latest count, we are now in 402 cities in mainland China with KFC, and over 60 cities with Pizza Hut casual dining. No other brands have this level of penetration and we do not see this picture changing anytime soon. ", "Of course, it is great for us as a restaurant company that the economy continues to grow 10% per year, because obviously more consumers can buy our food. ", "For KFC, we expect to add 300 new restaurants in mainland China, which will continue to widen our lead over our nearest competitor. We now have 1,000 more units than McDonald\u2019s after having only a 100-unit advantage five years ago. Our brand majors and returns remain very strong and KFC will continue to strengthen its leading position in 2007. ", "This year, we are celebrating our 20th anniversary in China with KFC. Our team has a great plan for the year, with exciting new products, drinks and desserts, and we are very effectively aiming for the young adult market that now has money to spend. ", "For our 20th anniversary, we have targeted advertising which features what we are doing to enrich the life for our Chinese customers, in addition to all the new products that we are advertising this year. The advertising includes our First Light Foundation, which provides college scholarships to kids, the KFC 3-on-3 basketball tournament, which has grown in three short years to a significant, nationally televised event with over 180,000 players. We are also advertising our educational efforts on nutrition and balanced lifestyle, where we have distributed over 600 million nutritional leaflets and tray mats, because as you\u2019ll recall, we offer a full line of vegetables and soups at KFC as well. ", "We are also advertising our KFC hostess program, who have become a key part of their local communities in various outreach activities, including on average hosting two birthday parties per day in every KFC. ", "KFC is a power brand any way you look at it, with cash on cash returns for our new units of just 18 months. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to our Pizza Hut casual dining business. We are continuing to build on our leading position. We now have over 250 restaurants and growing rapidly. We are now moving into tier three cities, which provides further growth and is a great testament to the strength and reach of the brand. We expect to open as many as 70 new restaurants in 2007, which actually would make our Pizza Hut casual dining concept in mainland China one of the fastest growing casual dining concepts in the world. ", "For Pizza Hut home service, we will begin expansion in more cities to build scale after the successful test in Shanghai that we conducted in 2006. We expect to add about 20 new Pizza Hut home service units in 2007. ", "Finally, we expect to expand our East Dawning concept in Shanghai later this year to gain scale for TV testing. ", "We remain very focused against our number one strategy of building dominant brands in China in every significant category. We have a huge strategic advantage with our team in place in Shanghai, our own distribution system, and our development team, which is producing results that are unmatched by anyone in mainland China and perhaps the world. ", "We continue to expect that our China division will be our lead growth business, with 20% growth in operating profit. ", "Now on to YRI, Yum! Restaurants International. As I noted earlier, YRI is off to a great start in 2007, with profit growth of 25%. This is one of the best quarters that YRI has ever had. Importantly, the business ended 2006 on a strong note and continued the momentum into 2007. ", "The most important aspect to our high return YRI business and achieving its annual 10% profit growth target is the continued new unit development by our 750-plus franchisees in the many markets where we are category-leading players in QSR chicken with KFC and family or casual dining with Pizza Hut. ", "We opened 785 new restaurants last year, the seventh consecutive year we have opened at least 700 units, and expect to continue to build on that track record again this year with at least 750 new openings. ", "Importantly, we are off to a great start with 146 new openings in Q1, which is 20-plus more than last year\u2019s Q1. ", "Our system sales growth results continue strong, with 10% growth on a local currency basis in the first quarter, with our single biggest challenge being the turnaround of our Pizza Hut U.K. business. ", "Our businesses are generally strong across the board. I just visited Japan, India, Dubai, and Jordan along with my trip to China. Pizza Hut has experienced unprecedented sales growth in Japan. In India, KFC's volumes look promising. Pizza Hut continues to have the most trusted brand while growing its sales. Our success in the Middle East is even more impressive. We are going to open 100 new units this year while the markets there continue to generate an average of 11% same-store sales growth for the past four years, and the KFC assets there are absolutely world-class. ", "To top it off, I had a lot of fun after I took my helicopter trip just to see what is going on in Dubai. It was amazing. If you want to go skiing, just go to their new mall there. You can get year-round skiing. But anyway, I had a lot of fun. We took a look at our flagship sites for our first Taco Bell test in Dubai and the team is very excited and we are going to have a great location and people are really pumped up about seeing how we do there. ", "We are in 113 countries with YRI and frankly, we have only one major issue, and that\u2019s the Pizza Hut U.K. business, where we put in our management team and we\u2019ll do the right things to turn that business around over time. ", "The key is that the YRI team has done a great job at enhancing our brand positioning around the world, improving the consistency of our advertising and developing great new product pipelines. As great new ideas are generated in various markets in the world, they are quickly adapted by their partners in the rest of YRI\u2019s markets. Most important of all, we continue to have a great operational focus that targets to get better and better with the objective of being the number one brand in terms of consumer preference in all our markets. ", "I just recently attended our bi-annual YRI franchise convention in Sydney, Australia. I can tell you that I am really excited about how our YRI franchisees are very committed to our brands. ", "First, they are very focused on building our brands the right way. Second, we believe our YRI franchisees will continue to aggressively build new units looking for further expansion, and finally, our franchisees are demonstrating a strong desire and commitment to world-class assets with the KFC brand and the Pizza Hut enhanced dine-in concept that is so successful around the world. ", "To summarize, we are confident YRI will have another great year in 2007 with at least 10% operating profit growth. The new unit pipeline remains robust and sales trends for both our KFC and Pizza Hut brands are strong in many markets of the world, and our franchisees are committed to continued growth. ", "Now I will turn it over to Rick Carucci, our CFO, who will take you through the numbers in detail. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to review three items today. First, Yum!'s first quarter results; second, our 2007 outlook and key trends; and third, a brief update of our refranchising program and our full-year cash flow expectations. ", "Let\u2019s now review our first quarter results, which was a strong quarter for us given our U.S. performance. This is one of our best quarters ever in terms of combined growth from our two international business. Worldwide operating profit growth was 12%. Quarter one EPS was $0.70, up 19% versus last year. This performance gave us the confidence to increase our full year EPS forecast to at least 11% growth, or $3.23 per share. ", "Now let\u2019s look at quarter one by business segment. Needless to say, our China division had a great quarter, with 31% profit growth. This growth was driven by strong new unit development and strong same-store sales growth in mainland China. Impressively, restaurant margin was up over one point versus a year ago. ", "You may note from our financials for the China division, for the quarter G&A increased 31%, which included five points of growth from foreign currency translation. This increase was primarily driven by continued growth in the business and the people needed for the development of our portfolio of brands. We expect that this level of year-over-year growth will moderate as the year progresses. ", "To recap, China division quarter one operating profit as up 31% or up 26% excluding the benefit of favorable currency. ", "Yum! Restaurant International, or YRI, also had a very strong first quarter with 25% operating profit growth. This operating performance was led by very strong sales results which exceeded our expectations. Our system sales grew by 10% in local currency terms, one of our best quarters ever. ", "There were two key factors driving this performance. First, our same-store sales growth for the system was plus 7%, with strength almost across the board in terms of markets. This is obviously a tremendous result. ", "Second, our year-over-year development rate of new restaurants was a very solid plus 4%. Our ongoing target is plus 3%, so we are quite satisfied with this pace. 94% of these quarter one openings were by franchisees, which reflects the strength of the YRI franchise community and the underlying solid economics of the business. ", "In addition, our new unit growth is broad-based in nature, with new unit openings the past year in over 40 countries with KFC and over 35 countries with Pizza Hut. ", "For quarter one, our restaurant margin improved by three-tenths of a percent. This is despite a one point reduction due to the inclusion of the Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture business. Our YRI team is working very hard to make progress in this area and we expect to see improvement for the full year. ", "As seen in last night\u2019s release, the acquisition last October of the remaining 50% in our Pizza Hut U.K. joint venture business had a large and expected impact on YRI results. The primary measures impacted are franchise fees, company sales, and operating margin. The impact of the acquisition on these measures is reflected in the earnings release. ", "Our Pizza Hut U.K. business is one of the few markets with weak sales and profit results in quarter one. With the new leadership in place, we are expecting performance to improve as the year progresses and as David said, this is our single biggest YRI challenge. ", "To recap, overall YRI\u2019s quarter one operating profit was up 25% on a reported basis, or up 23% when you exclude the favorable foreign currency benefit of $2 million. ", "Before we leave YRI, let me give you a quick breakdown of this 23% profit growth in local currency. Eight points of growth was generated by our franchise business. Eight points of growth was driven by our equity markets. Strength in the U.K. KFC business in Mexico more than offset the weakness in the Pizza Hut U.K. business during quarter one. Five points of growth came from our new growth markets, primarily our developing continental Europe KFC business, and finally two points of growth came from leveraging headquarter G&A. ", "Let\u2019s turn now to the U.S. business performance for quarter one. Obviously we were disappointed. The 11% decline in operating profit was not surprising, given the weak U.S. sales and the magnitude of the adverse Taco Bell publicity. You should know that each of the brands is working very hard to improve performance levels and Taco Bell will also benefit as time passes. ", "There was a 6% decline in blended U.S. company same-store sales. Overall, it is important to note that same-store sales results for the U.S. systems, which includes our franchise results, performed better. System same-store sales declined 3% for the first quarter, lapping a very strong plus 5% last year. ", "The sales decline was the key driver of the U.S. restaurant margin decline of 1.7 percentage points. U.S. commodity costs for quarter one were slightly favorable, with favorability in meat, cheese, and produce costs offset by higher costs in wheat, flour and fish. ", "Team member wage rates increased in the 4% to 6% range, which contributed to the higher cost of labor percentage versus 2006. ", "One factor that added to the overall U.S. performance in quarter one was other income. We benefited from a small gain in 2007 due to the closeout of our Katrina insurance claims. We were also lapping an $8 million charge last year related to a new beverage contract. This swing had a positive year-over-year impact of 6% in U.S. operating profit. ", "Again, all of these factors combined led to an 11% decline in U.S. operating profit, lapping a 19% increase in quarter one of 2006. ", "Overall for Yum!, we continued to benefit from our substantial share repurchases with an additional 4% decline in diluted shares outstanding. Our tax rate was slightly lower than last year, which helped offset a slight increase in interest expense. ", "Finally, in quarter one, we had a $1 million gain from all of our refranchising transactions versus a $4 million loss a year ago. This added slightly to our year-over-year EPS growth. ", "Now let\u2019s briefly review our 2007 outlook. First, let me reiterate our Yum! long-term growth model, which includes 20% operating growth from our China division, 10% operating profit growth from YRI, and 5% operating profit growth from our U.S. business. This adds up to 9% to 10% growth in annual operating profit. ", "The timing of the Taco Bell recovery will clearly impact our overall U.S. business performance. From a quarterly perspective, we believe Taco Bell bottomed out in quarter one. We expect to see improved sales results as we move forward. We expect to be positive in the second-half of the year. ", "As the year progresses, our U.S. comparisons ease substantially. To illustrate this, let\u2019s review our 2006 quarter one and quarter four growth rates. In quarter one of 2006, U.S. company same-store sales growth was plus 4% and operating profit growth was 19%. In quarter four of 2006, U.S. same-store sales declined by 2% and operating profit was down 8% excluding the 53rd week. ", "At this point, our best estimate is that our U.S. operating profit for the year will be positive but below our 5% target process growth model. ", "In terms of quarterly trends, you should be aware of a few thoughts that we can provide. First, it is difficult to predict gains we may incur from refranchising transactions in advance. However, I can tell you that in quarter two just ahead, based on the number and the nature of the deals in the pipeline, we will not match last year\u2019s gain of $15 million in quarter two. In fact, it is very likely we will only achieve a slight gain in quarter two. This will have negative 5% to 6% impact to quarter two EPS. This is purely a quarterly timing issue, so let me be clear; don\u2019t get ahead of us on the second quarter. ", "Additionally in quarter two, there is an expense we incur at YRI every two years for our franchise convention. This will negatively impact our growth rate at YRI at quarter two by about four points. ", "Finally, in terms of the U.S., our expectation is that performance will improve some time in the second-half, with much more certainty during quarter four as Taco Bell laps the produce supplier issue late in the quarter, which includes $20 million in lost profit and incremental costs related to that incident. We have solid confidence that our plans in the U.S. will drive positive performance in quarter four. ", "From a corporate perspective, at this time we expect pretty steady share buy-backs throughout the year. ", "One final point; the tax rate could fluctuate fairly dramatically quarter to quarter. ", "For full year, the combination of the strong start at our China and YRI businesses, a rebound in the U.S. in the second-half of the year, and substantial share buy-backs gives us confidence to increase our full-year guidance up to 11% growth, or $3.23 per share. Our previous guidance was at least $3.21, or at least 10% growth. ", "Let\u2019s now discuss refranchising and 2007 cash flow expectations. There is no change to our plans. Our U.S. target is to reach about 83% franchise ownership and 17% company ownership of the overall U.S. system by year-end 2008. This will be achieved primarily through refranchising activity at Pizza Hut, Long John Silver's, and KFC. Consistent with our earn-the-rights-to-own principles, we expect to see very little refranchising at Taco Bell, where our margins are very strong. ", "During 2007 and 2008, you should expect to see continued cash proceeds from U.S. refranchising, increases in U.S. franchise fees, positive impact to U.S. restaurant margin and operating margin, positive impact to Yum! ROIC, and less demand on capital expenditures from the U.S. business. ", "We believe we made good progress in 2006 with the refranchising of 452 U.S. restaurants, so we remain confident of reaching our target. ", "As always, we will do this the right way for our brand, our operators, our franchisees, and our customers. ", "On the YRI side for 2007, you should expect to see some pick up in new activity as the year progresses, as we begin refranchising some Pizza Hut U.K. restaurants. By the end of 2009, we plan to bring our effective ownership level back down to the range it was when the joint venture was in operation, or about 40% company operated. I can report that the process in the U.K. has begun and we are already actively pursuing transactions. ", "Importantly, you can continue to expect us to take a hard look at our global company ownership each year using our earn-the-rights-to-own principles as a guiding force. ", "For 2007, you should expect another year of a strong balance sheet and substantial levels of free cash available for payout to our shareholders. We expect to return $1.3 billion in cash in 2007, which is even more cash than the $1.1 billion returned in 2006. I will remind you that our quarterly dividend just doubled to $0.30 with our second quarter payments. This represents about a 2% yield and provides a more balanced payout to our shareholders. For the full year 2007, we continue to expect a 3% to 4% reduction in our share count due to share buy-backs. ", "To wrap up, we expect another successful operating year performance from our portfolio, generating consistent financial performance, impressive global growth, and strong global cash flow. ", "Back to you, David. ", "David C. Novak", "Rick, I think you gave a very good summary, so why don\u2019t we just go to the question and answers. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "Your first question comes from David Palmer with UBS. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Congratulations on the quarter. Are you getting feedback when I speak here? Because I\u2019m now getting feedback from you. ", "David C. Novak", "No. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Okay, good. I guess what a lot of folks are keen to know now is with your debt leverage being where it is, one turn or a little over that of EBITDA, and seeing what folks are seeing here in the franchise world, that does seem rather low. Could you perhaps comment on the opportunity to take that up over time, if you might be taking that up more aggressively in the near-term than kind of a creep up with aggressive share repurchase. ", "Secondly, you have some callable debt. What is the plan there perhaps to refinance that? I assume you have that flexibility. Thanks very much. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Obviously we have a strong balance sheet which does give us flexibility. We generate a lot of free cash and our capital requirements have been pretty steady in the 600 to $7 million range. We are also continuing to increase our percentage of franchise ownership, which gives us less volatility on our cash flow. ", "What we said in December is that we plan to increase our debt over time with the growth of operating cash flow. Obviously our ratios are in great shape. We are still reviewing whether this is the right answer and we will probably have an answer later this year. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Okay, thanks very much. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, David. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with CIBC. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thanks. In the U.S., maybe to help isolate the pressures you are experiencing from Taco Bell, is there any way, like you did in the YRI business, to isolate the profit impact that Taco Bell had versus what the underlying system did, or the other two brands did? ", "In a related question, has this incident in Taco Bell spilled over into the multi-brand units? Are you see underperformance there as well? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "The first part of that, we don\u2019t disclose the breakdown by brand. Obviously with Taco Bell sales being down 11%, it had a disproportionate impact on the results. As a reminder, the Taco Bell impact in quarter four last year was $20 million. ", "Regarding the multi-branding piece of it, yes, it does have an impact, especially on the KFC/Taco Bell brands. We estimated that impact in quarter one was about 2% of same-store sales growth. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "Great, thanks, and then just an unrelated, or moving to China, there has been some discussion in the press about minimum wage pressure there. Could you talk to what is going on? Do workers in your restaurants there make the minimum wage, or is the market rate substantially above right now the minimum wage there? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "For others, the background for that question is that there was an erroneous press report that we were not paying our students the proper minimum wage. What happens is that -- first of all, we are abiding by all the laws that occur in mainland China. Effectively, the press report got it wrong. ", "We do pay minimum wage to certain employees. Students are actually not included under that minimum wage. We have a separate student wage, which we had gotten approved by the government, which the press was unaware of that. The subsequent investigation by the government showed we were in full compliance. ", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. Actually, all of my questions are on China. First, do you think there is an opportunity to ramp up company expansion beyond the current level in the out years? ", "David C. Novak", "I think there is obviously an opportunity to ramp it up. I mean, if you just look at what\u2019s going on right now. We are moving in to more and more cities successfully. We have both Pizza Hut and KFC with fantastic unit economies. Pizza Hut home service is definitely looking to be very positive and we are in the expansion mode there outside of Shanghai, and we are very hopeful on East Dawning. Rick and I just recently had all the food and we are making a lot of progress. It was fantastic food. The team is very excited about it and passionate about making it happen, so we think over time that is going to happen. We think we will ramp up the expansion over time. ", "I had an interesting discussion. You know, a lot of this is very qualitative, but I had discussion with Mark Cho who runs our KFC business. I asked him how many restaurants he thought we could build effectively right now just with our operating capability, and he said 550 no problem. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, I was going to ask that question. ", "David C. Novak", "The reason why he feels that way is you if you go -- I was on a tour in China. I was in one zone I went to a small tier three city, or four city, and you walk in there and you see a great restaurant general manager and you see three assistants that basically can run any restaurant. So we have that kind of capability. ", "So I think our people capability is there. The big challenge we have is to find the right sites and we are doing that, but we expect to be able to ramp up over time. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, secondly I know that looking in that division, franchising has been relatively steady. When does that become a more important part of the China division, if ever in the near-term? ", "David C. Novak", "I think in the near-term, it is not going to be that important. Frankly, we have the philosophy of earn the right to own. Basically, the kind of operations that we have in KFC are just outstanding. We have over 20% margins. We have cash on cash return for new units that are within 18 months. Our operational measures are among the best in the world, so we are kind of taking the major big box retailer approach of a target there. We can move faster by owning ourselves. ", "We are franchising and bringing in new franchisees, and we see Pizza Hut home service possibly as being much more of a franchise concept versus equity. ", "Right now, we are moving quickly with operational excellence and we have lots of leverage by owning. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and -- ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Two further points to that; one is that economically, we feel it is in our best interest to develop restaurants and then franchise because the returns are what they are. A second thing to David\u2019s point, we are building capability in franchising. We have been franchising for a while there and we are optimistic that as the economy continues to grow there, you have more, a larger and larger franchisee pool of people who have money. ", "So we think over time, we will be able to build our franchise side out. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Very good, and the final question, again in the China division, I know Thailand and Taiwan have constraints in reported results in that division. In other words, mainland China is actually better than it looks. Is there an opportunity to refranchise any of those markets in the near-term? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "We have no plans in the near-term on Taiwan or Thailand. It is something we will continue to look at over time. Again, to your point, we do concentrate -- we\u2019re looking at the business at our mainland China results, although obviously we report it the way we do because that is how our management is structured. ", "David C. Novak", "I think the other thing is no one gets a hall pass on our earn the right to own philosophy, so if we are not earning the right to own in Taiwan, Thailand, or you pick the country, we will get on it. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, very good, great quarter. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, John. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Omohundro with Wachovia Bank. ", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Thanks. Just some more questions on Taco Bell. Regarding the weakness in the quarter, is it fair to say it was concentrated mostly in the Northeast, or was it much broader than that? And if so, maybe you could give us just some general waitings on that. That is my first question. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "The weakness is actually throughout the nation but is worse in the Northeast, so roughly double the downside in the Northeast. ", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Regarding the upcoming marketing strategy behind the brand, could you just in general talk about how you might tweak it to respond to consumer concerns about Taco Bell and how you would address that? ", "Finally, does this have any impact on the timing of the breakfast rollout? Thanks. ", "David C. Novak", "Basically, we are pretty much marketing the brand the way we have been marketing the brand because we have had a lot of success with that and we think that our advertising is good, our products are good, the value proposition is good. I think the big thing that we think we have to do is just give time time. We have to get through this and we will. We\u2019ll get through it and we will start picking up in the second-half of the year. There is no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater here. ", "We are just really patient with what we have here and we have 1,000% belief in the Taco Bell brand and that it will come back. ", "The other thing is that, regarding the breakfast launch where we -- we are basically in four markets right now. We have not delayed the timing and we are getting good learning and we are going to stay after it. I think we are steady as she goes and we expect improvement. ", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Thanks. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jeff. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia with Citigroup. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks. I have a quick follow-up on the Taco Bell comment, and then one other question. David, if you could comment on what your internal consumer research or consumer metrics are telling you as to how consumers are feeling about the Taco Bell business today, and maybe how that has changed over the course of the last couple of months? ", "David C. Novak", "I think our Taco Bell brand, when we look at our monitors, we look at our value ratings in quality and the overall big things that we look at. We really have not seen a significant change. Obviously when you have a major event, your image ratings will take a dip over the short-term and work their way back, so we are basically seeing what we typically would expect to see. ", "That is why I think the big thing we have to do is just take some time. We have a very loyal user base. One of the big advantages we have at Taco Bell, remember, is we have a 70% share of the category with no national competitor, so when people want to have quick service fast food at a good value, we are there. ", "But obviously there are a lot of places you can eat, so when people, when we have an issue, people will have a tendency to go other places until time takes care of it. ", "So that\u2019s why we usually say when you have food safety issues, you are usually dealing with about six months and that is kind of where we are seeing it. We actually were bouncing back faster at Taco Bell than we have in other situations because of the strength of the brand, until we had the other issue that hit after e-coli. ", "We are just going to see how it all plays out, but we are totally confident that we have not had any long-term damage and that we are going to be able to build the brand over time like we though. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Okay, and then in terms of Pizza Hut in the U.S., you made a comment and I think it was also mentioned at the analyst day back in December, that you are targeting or your goal is to move away from local discounting. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but the pizza category tends to be one that is very deal-driven. So I\u2019m curious to know what gives you the confidence that you will be successful in moving away from that sort of, kind of shifting the way the industry had structured. ", "David C. Novak", "I think first of all, we will continue to be value competitive, but there is a difference between being value competitive and value lucrative. We think we have done some pretty silly discounting and we are trying to get rid of that. We don\u2019t think it is going to impact our overall value impression. ", "Plus we are testing some approaches that we think will give more of an enduring value proposition over time. ", "One thing about the pizza category is that it is very competitive and we really cannot go through all the things we are testing in that arena because if you look at what is going on in the category right now, I think Domino\u2019s is advertising our Big New Yorker right now on national television. Everything that we have done in the last ten years, they\u2019ve been doing for the last three, so we are not going to tell them what we are working on right now. ", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rachael Rothman with Merrill Lynch. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about maybe how the weakness in the U.S. business outside of Taco Bell is impacting or is not impacting the multiples that you guys are receiving on the refranchised units, and potentially if that is having any impact on the franchisees\u2019 desire to undertake the remodel program? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Regarding first the refranchising, it really has not impacted our refranchising program. That is based on marketing individual units and we are pretty confident that it is going to have very little impact on that side of it. ", "Regarding the remodeling efforts, quite a fair bit of that, most of that is contractual and so people have to continue to do the remodel. For KFC, the system is scheduled to be remodeled by June, 2008 and we expect that pace to continue. ", "David C. Novak", "The other reason why I don\u2019t think it is really affecting the multiples is that the franchisees recognize that we have underleveraged assets. They see the value and that is a big plus. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Great, and just as a quick follow-up, on the brands outside of Taco Bell and KFC and Pizza Hut, can you talk maybe a little bit about what\u2019s giving you such conviction in this stronger back-half, other than easing compares? It is a reinvigoration of those product pipelines or new advertising or -- what are you guys focused on to drive actual growth in sales rather than just a rebound from the easing comps? Thanks. ", "David C. Novak", "Well, I think that we have a good pipeline of product news. We have good advertising and we continue to make steady progress -- not quantum leap progress but steady progress in our operations. It is sort of the blocking and tackling of the business that we know how to do. ", "We feel good about our calendars and the environment and we expect to see better performance. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Rachael. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bear Stearns. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Thank you. First couple of questions -- what are you thinking in terms of food cost inflation for the U.S.? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "We have not changed our full-year forecast yet, Joe, of 2% or 3% for the full year. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "And then a question on the G&A, the corporate level G&A was down year over year in the first quarter. Anything unusual there or should we expect to see that G&A number down on the corporate side? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "What happened is last year we had taken some legal reserves that we did not have to overlap this year, so it is basically overcoming a negative number from last year that gave us the upside. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and then you laid out the year-over-year comparisons in the quarters for the U.S. business. Could you walk us through YRI and China? The same-store sales numbers in the first quarter for both were very, very strong. Just as the year progresses, do those comparisons get a lot tougher for both of those? Just kind of lay out expectations a little bit, if you can. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "We\u2019ll probably just repeat what we said before, Joe, which is we said at the beginning of the year that we expected YRI to have harder overlaps in the second-half of the year and pretty favorable overlaps in the first-half of the year. Really, a lot of that was driven by the U.K. performance from the previous year. I would say nothing really new from that front. ", "China, when the year started we expected to be fairly steady quarter to quarter from last year. Now obviously we don\u2019t expect to have the type of quarter we just had every quarter, but there is nothing out there that was unusual in terms of the overlaps for China last year. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and then just the U.S. sales question, two U.S. sales questions; the Taco Bell down 11% number you shared I believe is a company number. Could you share what the Taco Bell system wide same-store sales numbers were? And then, last call you did share with us the KFC and Pizza Hut numbers. Could you do that again? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "On the system wide, relative to Taco Bell, Joe, we are only providing the U.S. blended number, which was 3% decline versus the company, which was 6% decline. Basically, each of the brands in the U.S. franchise systems performed anywhere from 2 to 4 points better than the company side, so it was across all three brands. ", "Our policy going, as we established it last quarter, was not to disclose individual brand performance in the U.S. unless there was an out layer of performance, which was a significant driver to the overall business in the U.S. That is the case in this quarter and that is why we disclosed individually the Taco Bell company same-store sales number for the first quarter. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "So we are only going to get those numbers if they are really good or really bad? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "That would be correct. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "What do you consider a normalized range of same-store sales? Actually better than down 5? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "No comment. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "It\u2019s a big part of the business you keep missing the -- that\u2019s it for me. Thanks. ", "David C. Novak", "I think there is a reason why we are doing this. We are not your ordinary restaurant company. We have been working for years to get value for being not your ordinary restaurant company. ", "We have China. We have YRI, and we have a U.S. business, and it\u2019s a portfolio. The real major for us in the U.S., and just look at our cash flow, we have averaged 3% growth the last five years in cash flow, 2% in profit. We have a real steady base there and we have a portfolio and that blended number is really the most salient number for people who look at it. ", "If there is an out layer, particularly on the downside, I think, we are not going to hide any salami. We are going to tell you exactly where it\u2019s at and what the issue is here. ", "But we want to get value for what we are, and it is not your ordinary restaurant company. We have a global business that nobody else has with China and YRI, and we have a U.S. business that nobody else has either. ", "We have 20,000 restaurants in the United States we think that are under-leveraged, that have only been growing at a 2% rate and we are not happy about that, okay? So we are going to get all over that like you would expect us to, but that is why we are doing it. ", "We are not trying -- it\u2019s not funny, okay? We\u2019re sitting here, we\u2019re laughing but we are very serious about presenting our business the way it really is. Those three things I think make us very different -- China, YRI, portfolio of U.S. businesses, and then add in a fourth is cash flow. You look at our cash flow position and what we are paying back to the shareholders, there aren\u2019t too many restaurant companies that are doing that. ", "That is why we are communicating what we are communicating. It is not to be cute. We are very transparent. I think we have a very good record for being that way. If we ever have a problem, we will be the first to tell you that. ", "I just want to say that, because I don\u2019t want to give any sort of glib feeling about this. We are doing this all for a reason. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. I would like to ask a little bit on the U.K. Pizza Hut business. If you could expand a little bit more on the challenges there. Are you just facing margin issues? Are the comps weak? Is refranchising really all it\u2019s going to take to address the issues, or are there broader things you are doing on the menu? ", "David C. Novak", "I think we are definitely facing margin issues and we are definitely facing comp issues, and I think the reason is that we just really did not manage that business well the last three years. That is why we acquired it. We had a joint venture partner we worked with for a number of years that frankly, we were not making as much progress as we needed to make, so we are in a major turnaround mode. So we are really trying to improve our ops and improve our assets, improve our overall marketing, which has been all over the map and we are just in the process of turning that business around. ", "We have huge interest in our refranchising, and I basically advised the team let\u2019s go after that but let\u2019s do it the right way. Let\u2019s get the best people. There\u2019s no -- we don\u2019t have to -- we are not trying to win a race here. We want to build this business the right way so we have a real quality business and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do -- turn the business around the right way and in a sustainable way. ", "Right now, I would say we have issues about everywhere you would not want to have issues, with one big plus is there is huge demand for our stores. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "And the U.K. in total is like a quarter of your profits there in YRI, and you still had a record increase in earnings, so what would the YRI number have been if you hadn\u2019t had the U.K. drag? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "That is something we don\u2019t provide. I think we\u2019ve basically been pretty open in the fact that Pizza Hut U.K. business has been down the last couple of quarters, but the other side of that though is that the KFC U.K. business is doing extremely well.

I was just curious what your thoughts are on the East Dawning development. ", "David C. Novak", "By the end of the year or the first of next year, we expect to have enough stores there where we can advertise it. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "There\u2019s regional television, so you can buy TV just in Shanghai. ", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Mark. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Barish with Banc of America. ", "Andrew Barish - Banc of America", "A quick follow-up on the U.K. and the KFC success there. Does that provide you a little bit of a template for the Pizza Hut turn in any way? Has the market in the U.K. just gotten a lot better? We have seen good numbers out of McDonald\u2019s and Burger King there as well, so maybe some commentary on the broader quick service market in the U.K., if you could. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Just a couple of things. First of all, both KFC and Pizza Hut, I think we are proud of our history on both brands over time there. Both brands have performed well if you look at it over a number of years. ", "What we have right now, your point is the U.K. industry is getting better overall, but what we are doing right now is we are under-performing that industry on Pizza Hut and way over-performing against that industry on KFC. So KFC has been flying. We have had tremendous results there at the same time that we have struggled with Pizza Hut. ", "In terms of the way back, there are certain fundamentals in the business that are similar in terms of taking care of customers, product innovation, et cetera. But the execution of that will be quite different on the Pizza Hut side versus KFC, especially we have to really improve our service levels on our dine-in business. I think the team is getting on top of that. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. A few questions back on the U.S. First, on the pizza category and Pizza Hut, it seems to be that over the last few months, the television spot advertising may be a bit more aggressive than it has been in the past, using competitor names and logos and stuff. I am wondering, is there a change in your advertising tact here and is this a lever you are looking to pull to perhaps combat some of the discounting stuff that you are trying to move away from? ", "David C. Novak", "Last year we did a lot of testing, concept testing, positioning testing, to try to get at what really made us unique, and the fact of the matter is there is a very powerful positioning that we are at the early stages of beginning to execute, which is America\u2019s favorite, always gives you more. So if you watch the advertising, it says want more? Get America\u2019s favorite. So we are going to continually keep giving consumers a rationale of what we give that the other people don\u2019t give. ", "Now, whether we mention direct competitors or not over the long term I think is up in the air, but our pan pizza is America\u2019s favorite because it tastes better than Papa John\u2019s and Dominos. Our new improved hand-tossed pizza is America\u2019s favorite because it now tastes better than our two major national competitors. ", "So we have tested these things. We do a lot of things that we have not been getting enough credit for at Pizza Hut, so we are in the midst of really trying to do a much better job of that. I think it will ultimately pay off for us over time. ", "We know when we put real meats on the bones of America\u2019s favorite gives you more, we get a lot of credit for it with the consumers, and all of our ratings go up and we feel like we have a great position. We just have to execute that over time. ", "The more aspect of this is sort of like our conscience. Everything that we do we want to demonstrate that we are giving the consumer more. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "And then on the KFC business, David, you referenced pulling the lever of late night a little bit more. Can you maybe frame that for us, if you indexed KFC versus some of the industry peers? Maybe quantify how many hours you guys were under-indexed from an extended hour standpoint? ", "David C. Novak", "We are not even on the map. We close before night time begins, so I\u2019m saying that to the entire system. We think this is a significant opportunity. We tested this in New York. We have a specific menu that allows us to do it in a way that we can offer late night products that help us deal with some of the product issues in terms of availability and we are going to expand it on a DMA by DMA basis. ", "I think one of the things that Emil did when he was at Taco Bell was they had a very strong market-by-market focus and we are going to try to do things on a scale basis with all of our brands when we test things, so we do things well in every market that we have tested or expanded. ", "So we will be moving across the country with late night and hopefully stay open later and later and later. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Lastly within the multi-branding, Pizza Hut/WingStreet is the big vehicle of growth there. Could you give us a sense for how the units that are in the comp base from the Pizza Hut/WingStreet are doing year over year? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "The good news is -- well, there\u2019s two different businesses. We should think of it separately on dine-in versus delivery. We have been at the delivery side for a while. We are pretty confident it adds a decent layer of sales to our business, and we are getting franchisees to do it. So we have been doing it for four years on delivery. ", "What\u2019s exciting to us and more new is the dine-in side of the business. We don\u2019t have a lot of restaurants yet converted there, but the thing that\u2019s been impressive is two things. First of all, we had a huge growth rate when we put in the new menu and upgraded the asset, but the second thing that\u2019s encouraging, for those units that have been open more than a year is we are getting positive comps the second year and we have not gotten that on previous dine-in initiatives. So it is still early days, but we are gaining confidence as that time goes on that we may have something here. ", "David C. Novak", "We already have over 1,000 delivery carry-out units and we have rolled it out on a market-by-market basis. Now we are working with our franchisees to get scale across the board, so we are very confident that we have a winning concept. Now the real challenge that we have is scale it so that we can get the marketing power behind it and get more differentiation in the marketplace. That is the real challenge and that is what we are working with our franchisees on and more and more of them are testing the restaurant-based WingStreet option and getting excellent results. We think that is going to help us upgrade the system the right way. ", "As you know, contractually the Pizza Hut franchisees need to improve their assets over the next few years, and so we basically have an economic proposition that is much better with WingStreet than just going in with the basic Pizza Hut. I think that proposition will help us upgrade the system with more scale and hopefully better unit economics. ", "I think that is going to take a little time to because the franchisees are getting into it and they are getting more and more learning on it, and you get more and more good, positive stories, that\u2019s how things work in our business. ", "So the press is really good on the WingStreet restaurant-based units and we think that will pay off. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Steven. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "You have a follow-up question from David Palmer with UBS. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "I think the street was surprised by both the strength internationally and the weakness in the U.S. Where were you surprised internationally by areas of strength? What do you think in particular was driving that strength where you saw it? Was it a macro economic conditions or something else? Could you give us some more detail, please? ", "David C. Novak", "I have a hard time guessing what the street is really thinking of. Some of the stuff I have read, the people were surprised the U.S. business performance was as good as it was since we had the two incidents that we had. ", "But what\u2019s going on -- China, you have 10% economic growth, 11% economic growth, you have a great competitive position and all the things that we\u2019ve been talking about. The economies are good outside the United States and there is a lot of optimism and things are moving in the right direction everywhere you go. Even in Japan. I told you I just got back from Japan. Things are looking up a bit. ", "So the macros I think are good outside the United States. The U.S. business is affected by a little bit tougher situation, but it is nothing that we can\u2019t handle over time with the right kind of marketing and operations. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "David, from my perspective, the thing that I was a little surprised at was the depth and magnitude of the international same-store sales growth. We obviously knew about the development piece because that has stuff we -- it\u2019s in the ground, so you know about it. But the size and the breadth of the same-store sales was higher than what I expected going into the quarter. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Does that feel macro to you, Rick? I guess that\u2019s the only explanation, that there was generally better consumer strength broadly internationally? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think that is clearly helping. We had a very strong fourth quarter back-half of the year as well on YRI. Really, all of 2006, the number of countries that were strong was higher than let\u2019s say previous years, the percentage of countries where we had same-store sales growth. ", "I do think the economy is helping. I also think our competitive position improving over time is a factor as well. We have been adding a lot more units outside the U.S. than everybody else, and that improves your market position, gives you better people capability, better marketing strength, et cetera. So I think it is a combination of our competitive position, our initiatives, and the economy. ", "David C. Novak", "The other thing I think really works for our favor internationally is the best practice sharing that we do. When we have one thing that works in one market, it is spreading and it spreads quickly and we can actually implement it faster because you don\u2019t have as much scale in a lot of these markets, so it is easier to implement something in a 200-store market than it is in a 5,000-store market. ", "The other thing I think is really exciting about our international business is things that we do, whether it\u2019s the United States or Canada or even in the big major markets where we have more restaurants, when we roll them out, they work a lot better because you do not have as much competition. That is a big advantage. ", "In the United States, you have 30 major chains out there fighting it out everyday. When we go abroad in most countries, the real big magilla there is McDonald\u2019s and maybe a Burger King in some places, or -- it is just not as competitive. I think that is a big advantage. ", "So the things that work in one market work bigger on the international scene. ", "The other thing that I think that we are really trying to do is we do have processes and discipline in the marketing function that are better than we have had before. I think the better we execute, the better the performance. ", "Believe me, we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to keep this momentum going. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Could I ask one more question, and that is about the spread between your company restaurants and the franchise units in the quarter? I was somewhat surprised by that, given the higher percentage of franchise Taco Bells in the Northeast. I was thinking that would actually cause it to be the reverse there. So maybe the spread was more a function of Pizza Hut and KFC, my theory being that the company stores in those two brands are more in the major metro markets and are more subject to competitive switching? What is the reason do you think for that gap? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "As I mentioned earlier, the franchise performance by brand in the U.S. was 2 to 4 points better. It was every brand, including Taco Bell. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Why? Why do you think? There are those urban versus rural markets type of stuff going on, which does dovetail with the competitive pressure and the proximity of competitors. Do you think there was that? ", "David C. Novak", "That is probably our best guess. It is not surprising to see franchise stores running ahead of company. They have lower sales bases in some cases, so they have -- when you are busy, you have less topping out at certain time periods. They can handle the peaks better. ", "So we\u2019ve seen that for a period of time. The magnitude of it was a little higher than normal and probably your theory on the rural/metro is our best at this point. Obviously something we are going to keep an eye on as we go forward. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, David. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Larry Miller with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "I was waiting to hear a little bit in more detail about why ex Whitbread, the YRI profits were up 360 to 370 basis points. Rick, can you give us a little more color on what the margin lines look like? You gave us some total margin lines. And why again that would not continue throughout the year? ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Just to back up, we said that our total -- we did talk a little bit about total restaurant margin, that it had a negative one point impact on the YRI results. YRI including that was up three-tenths of a percent, so the rest of the market was up. ", "Its impact on operating margin was about 3.6%, which was in the release, and that\u2019s what drove the overall operating margin decline for YRI of 2.7%. So without that, operating margin would have improved, which you would have expected given our sales results, and if the rest of the business has more franchise growth and slight refranchising, so the combination of the -- if you take out the U.K. business, the operating margin is being driven by a higher mix of franchise business as well as obviously great overall results. ", "David C. Novak", "That impact from the Pizza Hut U.K. acquisition will continue through the third quarter. We acquired the business in October, so that change in the business, effectively you are reflecting the G&A of that joint venture in our P&L, so that is the big driver of the operating margin change, and then the restaurant margin impact should continue the rest of the year as well. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, so higher G&A throughout the year, higher revenues as well. ", "David C. Novak", "Yes. ", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks very much. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Larry. Next question, please. ", "Operator", "You have no further questions at this time. ", "David C. Novak", "Let me wrap it up then. We had a very good quarter and we are pleased to report that on the strength of the global growth, that we have raised our full-year EPS forecast to at least 11% growth, or $3.23 per share, up from 10%. We will continue to build on our track record of consistency this year. ", "Second, you can expect global growth to continue with 1500 new stores opening around the world, and third, each of our businesses will generate free cash flow, giving us global capability to return $1.3 billion to shareholders, allowing us to reduce our shareholder count again and do it in a significant fashion and we will pay an above market dividend of approximately a 2% yield. ", "I think we are off to a good start and a lot of work to do. I can assure you we are going to stay after it. Thank you very much for the call.

Brands second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin. ", "Tim Jerzyk ", " Thank you, Tanya and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Before we start I would like to go through some calendar events that we have coming up this year for Yum! investors. First of all, September 6th and 7th the Yum! team will host a third China investor conference in Beijing, China. Investors and analysts are invited to attend this two-day meeting with the Yum! China management team. Just as a reminder this event is only eight weeks from now, so please, we need to hear from you right away if you plan to attend. Please contact Yum! Investor Relations as soon as possible. ", "Also, we will be in Hong Kong and Shanghai the following week, September 10th through the 14th. October 23rd we will be in Tokyo. The 24th of October we'll be in Shanghai meeting with investors. October 30th we have a Taco Bell Investor Day. December 12th we'll have our annual investor meeting in New York at the New York Stock Exchange. Please call us for more details. ", "This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. ", "I would also like to advise you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that reflect management's expectations based on currently available data. Our actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties. ", "Information in this conference call related to projections or other forward-looking statements may be relied on subject to our Safe Harbor statement which was included in the earnings release last night, and may continue to be used while this call remains in the active portion of the company's website, which will be until midnight Eastern Time, Friday July 20th, 2007. ", "On our call today you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both we'll take your questions. Now I would like to turn the call over to David Novak. ", "David Novak ", " Thank you, Tim and good morning, everybody. I am pleased to report that we had a strong quarter with growth of 15% and that we are increasing our full year EPS outlook to 12% growth from 11%. As you know, we are targeted to achieve at least 10% growth every single year, therefore we are particularly proud that we expect this to be the sixth straight year that we will beat that target. ", "Once again, our Mainland China and YRI businesses led the way in the Yum! portfolio. In Mainland China, we grew same-store sales by 7% and are on our way to another year of opening 375 new restaurants, further strengthening our competitive position. ", "At YRI, we grew same-store sales 5% and had one of our best-ever quarterly system sales performances as we head towards another year of new unit development that leads the industry. In fact, we expect 2007 to be the eighth straight year that the YRI division has added 700-plus new units. ", "When you look at this quarter's numbers, you will also see that we got a very nice boost from our tax rate which helped us offset challenging commodity inflation, higher prior-year refranchising gains, and weak but improving results in the United States. The quarterly tax rate will be volatile and it is important to note that the year-to-date is in line with our full year expectations. ", "Now let's review what with we see in each of our businesses and talk about their plans and trends. ", "In the China division, specifically Mainland China, our brands consumer dynamics are very strong and our brand regard is higher than ever as witnessed by the exceptional top line growth. KFC is celebrating the 20th anniversary of being in Mainland China, and we are very proud of the fact that we were the first U.S. brand there back in 1997 with our first KFC. We fully expect KFC will end the year with over 2,100 KFC restaurants and be in more than 400 cities. ", "There is no doubt that we are entrenched as a powerful brand that is part of the Chinese culture. Just to give you two factoids to support that fact. First, we do an average of two birthday parties every day in all our restaurants and we sponsor a very popular nationwide three-on-three basketball tournament with over 16,000 teams with the finals being broadcast on national television. ", "We are positioning KFC as your local community center as we build around the theme of Life is Tastier with KFC. We just reviewed the calendar with Sam Su and the team yesterday and we're confident about the programs that we have in place. ", "In addition, we also now have 289 Pizza Hut casual dining restaurants, the undisputed leader in the category, and we grew units by 31% versus last year during the second quarter. We are now in 60 cities and opening restaurants in less-developed cities, which a few years ago we didn't think could sustain a high-end restaurant; proving once again the strength and reach of our brands. We continue to expect to add 70 new Pizza Hut restaurants this year. ", "About three years ago we made a deliberate effort to separate the delivery business away from our Pizza Hut casual dining business, and we now have 41 Pizza Hut home service restaurants. In fact, we just added our second call center to handle the expected expansion of this business, and that call center is located in Beijing. We are doing everything we can to capitalize on the convenience of the delivery occasion, which will become more and more important as the economy continues to grow. ", "Finally, we continue to expand our East dining concept in the Shanghai market. Remember, this is a fast food Chinese concept. In fact, we now have eight restaurants which moves us closer to being able to conduct a television advertising test. ", "Now onto our Yum! restaurants international division, or YRI. I want to publicly congratulate Graham Allan and the YRI team on the exceptional quarter. We are in 113 countries and our overall business continues to be very strong around the world. For example, our Middle East franchise business unit drove a phenomenal second quarter systems sales growth of 32%; South Africa plus 28%; Caribbean plus 13%; and Asia up 12%. ", "In addition, we are seeing great initial results from our KFC advertising test in India and strong sales growth from our Rostik KFC co-branded units as well in Russia. ", "I just returned from a trip to Europe where we don't have much of a presence today. While McDonald's generates about $1 billion in profit from this region of the world, let me say that we have made great progress there the past few years. We already have a franchiseable proposition in Holland and France. In fact, we are seeing record average unit volumes with our KFC restaurants in France -- and when I say record average units, I am not talking about France, I am talking about the entire world where we have the highest sales on a per-unit basis now in France. ", "We're even making progress in Germany where we had early challenges. We believe our investments and patience are start to go pay off in continental Europe, and there is no doubt that we will eventually build a great business there. ", "Furthermore, we are tapping into new opportunities and countries like Vietnam which has more than 85 million people with a very young population. We are really starting to take off there. We now have 32 KFCs and two Pizza Hut restaurants with excellent opportunity and lots of growth. I look forward to going to that market next year. Frankly, I haven't even been to Vietnam yet, but to give you a sense of how quickly we have grown in that market, we only had 15 units at the end of 2005. We are in the early innings in lots of key developing countries like these, and we expect to see continued momentum across the world. ", "YRI's biggest challenge is Pizza Hut UK where we are making progress but still have too many ups and downs sales periods. However, given the process and discipline that the new team is implementing, we're confident that we're moving towards making more consistent performance with Pizza Hut UK. ", "Now, onto the United States businesses. Our U.S. businesses are recovering and we expect better results in the second half of 2007. Pizza Hut is making significant progress improving its value proposition with the successful re-launch of Pizzone and a number of test initiatives. We also now have system-wide Internet ordering capability and are seeing a steady rise in Internet ordering. ", "Our America's Favorite advertising is clearly resonating with the pizza category type consumers and our key brand measures are improving at a significant rate. KFC is also seeing its brand regard increase with the launch of zero trans fats. We just had our quarterly review at KFC and we are very confident with the approach the team is taking. ", "Taco Bell is our biggest challenge with same-store sales down 7% in company stores. While that represents improvement from the first quarter, we clearly have work to do. We are currently launching Chicken Taquitos and plan to launch another new product in the second half. Fortunately, we expect a benefit as well from an easier overlap. ", "All in all, we expect full year U.S. operating profit growth to be slightly positive but clearly below our 5% growth target. The U.S. continues to be a stable profit and cash flow contributor, but we know that we can and should be performing better. ", "Here are some of the long-term themes that we are focusing on: ", "Adding more balanced meals and choices for our customers; ", " Expanding in multiple day parts; ", " Broadening our protein offerings; ", " Creating destination desserts and beverages and ensuring that we have a solid positioning in everyday value; and, ", " Finally, developing system-wide contemporary assets including multi-branding on a focused basis. ", "Finally, in addition to driving more consistent results and leveraging our existing assets, we are also focused on ensuring that our company restaurants are earning their right to own, reducing our U.S. company ownership down from 26% in 2006 to 17% by the end of 2008, which will improve our returns from this business. ", "To summarize, the power of our global portfolio of leading restaurant brands continues to generate consistent EPS growth and significant free cash. This year we will generate a record $1.4 billion in cash from operating activities, while investing $650 million in growing and maintaining our brands around the world. ", "With such a significant cash generating capability, we expect to return $1 billion plus for the third consecutive year to our shareholders. In fact, we expect to buy back over $1 billion of our stock, reducing our share count by at least 3% and pay our shareholders a meaningful dividend with an approximate 2% yield. We are returning 5% cash to our shareholders through our share buyback and dividend. We expect to do at least similar levels in the next three years. ", "Over the long term, we expect to continue to grow our earnings per share at least 10% and build value by executing against our unique growth strategies with high returns that differentiate us from other global consumer companies. ", "Specifically, we will focus on our four key strategies: ", "(1) Building dominant restaurant brands in China; ", " (2) Driving profitable international expansion; ", " (3) Improving the United States' brands positionings and returns; and, ", " (4) Driving high ROIC and strong shareholder payout. ", "Now I will turn it over to Rick Carucci, our CFO, who will take you through the numbers. ", "Rick Carucci ", "Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. I am going to review three areas today: ", "First, our second quarter results; ", " Second, the 2007 full year outlook and key trends across our businesses; and, ", " Third, a brief update of our refranchising program and our full year cash flow expectations. ", "Looking at the second quarter, we were certainly pleased to report EPS growth of 15% despite some challenges. As you look at the numbers this quarter, overall Yum! results were clearly driven by strong operating performances from China and YRI, as well as the financial benefit of a lower tax rate and a 3% reduction in our share count. These factors more than offset a down quarter for our U.S. business, lower refranchise gains in last year, and higher commodity inflation in both the U.S. and China. Now let's look at the second quarter by our three business segments. ", "First, let's cover our China division. In quarter 2, China division profits were up 14% on a reported basis and plus 9% in constant currency. China division results were negatively impacted by the smaller business portions of the division, Thailand and KFC Taiwan. In the written disclosures of the earning release you can specifically see our Mainland China performance for some key measures. ", "Operating profit growth in Mainland China for quarter 2 was 20% on a reported basis. Our Mainland China business continues to be a key growth driver for Yum!'s overall results. In Mainland China, same-store sales and unit growth remain very strong. Mainland China business is driven by a rapidly growing economy and exceedingly strong competitive positions for both KFC and Pizza Hut. ", "One issue that began to impact our business in the second quarter was increased commodity inflation. There have been issues in Mainland China related to pork with both tight supply and increased prices. This contributed to greater demand for chicken. In addition, domestic chicken supply in China was further impacted by lower than expected output as well as increased exports to other markets. This led to a significant spike in chicken prices. We believe this impact is short-term in nature but will affect third quarter restaurant margins in terms of higher food costs. ", "In quarter 3 we expect to see double-digit commodity inflation as most of our needs are already contracted at higher prices. It is difficult to accurately predict our quarter 4 situation although we expect pricing in quarter 3 to help offset this impact. ", "To summarize, in Mainland China we have a stronger top line performance as well as some higher costs in the near term. Additionally, we are benefiting from a strong Chinese currency. Overall, our unit economics remain very strong, and we are continuing to rapidly expand both KFC and Pizza Hut, as well as develop new brands. ", "For Yum! Restaurants International, or YRI, the second quarter was a very strong quarter with operating profit growth of 15% or up 11% in local currency. Our top line performance at YRI is very strong with systems sales growth of plus 11% in local currency terms, lapping a plus 8% last year which was not an easy comparison. ", "Importantly, our sales growth strength is broad based with very few markets underperforming. Overall, our franchise market business grew second quarter profits by more than 20%. This was led by double-digit profit growth across the board including Asia, the Middle East, Europe, South Africa and Caribbean Latin America. Our company markets in total grew profit by 5%. ", "Strong performance in Mexico and KFC UK businesses were offset somewhat by our Pizza Hut UK business performance. Company restaurant margins declined slightly due to the inclusion of our wholly-owned Pizza Hut UK business versus last year when it was a 50/50 joint venture. Excluding this impact, our margin rose by 0.9 percentage points. ", "Finally, our second quarter was achieved despite higher G&A costs related to the UK acquisition, the costs of our biannual franchise convention and investment spending in Russia, India and Taco Bell. These are businesses which will potentially be large sources of future growth. Hopefully, you can see that we believe this business is doing well and is extremely valuable to Yum!. ", "Now onto our U.S. businesses. Overall, it was a disappointing performance with systemwide same-store sales flat versus last year and operating profit down 2%. Generally, the results were in line with what we laid out for our full year U.S. expectations last quarter. ", "Certainly you know from previous comments on these calls that we're not happy with this performance. Each brand team is working hard to improve performance both for the short term and long term, as David mentioned earlier. ", "Same-store sales performance for the second quarter improved across the board versus what we saw in the first quarter. We continue to believe the second half results will improve with stronger second half marketing programs and taxable changes to our balance of year programs. ", "In terms of our cost structure, we did experience the expected commodity inflation in quarter 2 -- about $10 million -- primarily in cheese, beef and wheat. Additionally, our restaurant margin was adversely impacted by state minimum wage laws enacted over the last 12 months and, of course, operating deleverage from the 3% decline in company same-store sales. ", "We continue to experience favorability in our insurance costs which helped to mitigate the unfavorable impacts I just mentioned. In addition, some productivity initiatives that have been put in place in the last year-and-a-half provide a profit upsides that helped offset inflation. ", "Overall for Yum!, in Q2 we benefited from share repurchases and a lower tax rate. Due to our substantial share buybacks, we saw another 3% reduction in our diluted share count year over year. Our tax rate was considerably lower than last year's rate and had a very significant impact to our quarter 2 EPS growth rate. Please note that our year-to-date tax rate is right in line with our full year guidance. ", "As we said on a number of occasions, the quarterly tax rate will be volatile. This volatility is caused by accounting rules that require booking certain tax events in the current quarter versus smoothing changes over the balance of the year. ", "Now let's review our 2007 outlook. First let me briefly reiterate our Yum! long-term growth model which includes 20% operating growth from our China division, 10% operating growth from YRI, and 5% operating growth from our U.S. business. This adds up to 9% to 10% growth in annual operating profit. ", "At this point, we expect China will meet its full-year target, YRI will meet or exceed its full-year target, and U.S. profit growth will be slightly positive. ", "For the full year, we increased our full year guidance to plus 12% or $1.63 per share. Our previous guidance was 11% growth. Our confidence is based on the strength of our global portfolio and a combination of the strong first half China and YRI results, a rebound in the U.S. in the second half of the year and continued substantial share buybacks. ", "In terms of our key trends in our business, I would cite these four: ", "(1) U.S. inflation is above historical rates in commodities and labor. ", " (2) As global economic growth has picked up pace, so has commodity inflation outside the U.S. ", " (3)A continued strong global economy and our strong competitive position globally will lead to continued growth in China and YRI. ", " (4) Our emerging markets for YRI continue to look better and better. ", "In terms of dealing with inflation both here in the U.S. and globally, we'll need to continue to deliver productivity initiatives and be disciplined and thoughtful in our menu mix and pricing action. We believe we are taking appropriate steps in both of these areas. For example, Pizza Hut has made progress in reducing discounting in the way that we believe has not had a negative impact on transactions. ", "At KFC, we have implemented a shift accountability program to improve restaurant level cash control and are beginning to see significant benefits from this initiative. ", "In terms of our global competitive position, we showed at our investor conference last December that over the last five years we really strengthened our competitive position as the leader of international development in our industry. We are pleased to report that for 2007 we expect to further improve this position. ", "Our new unit pipelines look strong for both Mainland China and for YRI. We now expect to open about 1,200 new units this year in China and YRI. ", "Finally, we are very pleased with the progress we're making in our YRI emerging markets. We see continued improvement quarter to quarter in our sales trends and markets like Russia, India, and KFC France. While still a small segment of YRI's business, system sales for the emerging markets grew at a 47% rate in the second quarter. When you look at these trends in total, we remain extremely confident that we will grow our EPS at least 10% in 2007, at least 10% in 2008, and for many years to come. ", "Now let's talk about what everyone appreciates about our business, and that is our cash flow. Before we get to the cash flow details, let me provide a brief summary of our refranchising plan. We are still on track to reach our U.S. target of about 83% franchise ownership and 17% company ownership by year end 2008. Therefore, through year end 2008 we should expect to see continued cash proceeds from U.S. refranchising, increases in U.S. franchise fees, positive impact to U.S. restaurant margin and operating margin, positive impact to Yum! ROIC, and less demand on capital expenditures from the U.S. business. You can continue to expect us to take a hard look at our global company ownership each year using our Earn the Right to Own principles as a guiding force. ", "For 2007, you should expect another year of substantial levels of free cash available for payout to our shareholders. We expect to return $1.3 billion in cash in 2007, which is even more cash than the $1.1 billion returned in 2006. For the full year 2007 we continue to expect at least 3% to 4% reduction in our share count to be share buybacks, and our dividend yield is now nearly 2%. ", "To wrap up, we expect another successful operating year performance from our global portfolio generating consistent financial performance, impressive global growth, and strong global cash flow. ", "Back to you, David. ", "David Novak ", " Okay, let's take some questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from John Glass - CIBC. ", " John Glass - CIBC World Markets", "Good morning. A couple of questions on China. First, what is the pricing opportunity there, maybe what you need in the near term to offset the commodity inflation? Also, how do consumers respond to price increases there? Is it the same or maybe different than in your domestic markets? ", " David Novak", " Well historically we have not taken a lot of pricing in China until the last couple of years. That was just because our buying power improved so much as we grew the number of units that we had and continued to improve our competitive position. So far we've taken modest price increases in China they've been absorbed quite easily into the marketplace. We still have very low relative pricing in China compared to other places in the world. ", "Regarding what's going to happen going forward, we're actually looking very hard at what our pricing should be in the third quarter, but we're not going to comment on the exact details. ", " John Glass - CIBC World Markets", "In China is there the same opportunity to hedge or to contract commodities as there is here? Can you go out as far, and has that changed recently? ", " David Novak", " Not yet. Really in China we're generally shorter than we are in other markets. The reason is the commodity market there is a bit more volatile, and suppliers don't want to commit to longer durations. We especially face that this time around when the export market opened up for the China poultry producers. ", " John Glass - CIBC World Markets", " Last question on China. Can you remind us what the Thailand and Taiwan issues are that hurt the second quarter profit growth? How are they factored in the second half projections or that 20% profit growth? ", " David Novak", " Well, in general, first of all from a profit basis, Taiwan and Thailand collectively are less than 10% of the profitability of the division. ", "Regarding what happened in the second quarter, two things. First of all, Thailand has had a lot of political issues that have translated into economic issues and has hurt our growth rate there. Taiwan is just a more competitive market for us. We generally have a fair amount of volatility in our growth rate although it is a good growing market over time. ", "So if you look at it over time, usually Thailand and Taiwan are a slight drag on the profitability just because it is only 10% of the business and it has a lower growth rate. At this time it just hit us particularly hard because we were down in those businesses versus prior year. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia - Citigroup. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "In terms of Taco Bell, in terms of why are the company restaurants in the U.S. so much under-performing the franchise restaurants, what's going in the company-owned markets? ", " David Novak", " I think basically in the company markets and the franchise markets the marketing program is pretty much the same. We have very little local marketing. Everybody is dealing with the same national marketing plan. I think we're just seeing a slightly stronger performance by our franchisees than in the company markets. ", " Rick Carucci", " Just to add to that, the franchise performance overall in the U.S. across our brands has been higher than our company, and that led to the difference; system sales growth was actually flat for the quarter versus companies were down a bit. ", "We think it is driven by two main factors. One is the franchise restaurants tend to be more concentrated in rural markets which are performing better. Secondly, tend to have on average lower average volumes, so they tend not to get maxed out at peak periods. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "In terms of UK if you could share with us the status of refranchising some of the Pizza Hut restaurants and if you could just refresh us on what perhaps the issues are that are preventing a more rapid turnaround there? ", " Rick Carucci", "Plans are going about as we expected in the UK. The plan was to buy back that business. We started the marketing campaign, but we said all along that most of the actual transactions aren't really going to start until the back end of the year, just getting time for people to send out the books, people to look at the business and start doing transactions. We're on pace. ", " David Novak", " Actually from an overall brand-building perspective, we put a new team in place. They're taking all the right actions, putting the right processes and discipline in place. We've actually had some very encouraging sales recently. ", "The problem that we have is that we'll have one big up period and the next period will be down, so we're just trying to work on getting more consistency. I think the team is really on track, and you'll see continued progress on the consistency front. ", " Rick Carucci", " Our goal on the refranchising is just to get down to what our effective ownership was before the acquisition which is 40% company ownership, and there is huge demand for the Pizza Hut brand in the UK so the real charge that we have given the team is to move towards our goal but to do it the right way and get the very best partners and that is really the objective. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", " Rick, how long do you think it will take it get back down to roughly 40% company-owned from where you are today? ", " Rick Carucci", " We thought about three years. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Just quickly on the outlook for cheese costs, I know it is notoriously hard to predict, but any sense we might be seeing a peak in some of the dairy? ", " Rick Carucci", " Glen, if you can forecast cheese prices, I think you definitely have another future ahead of you. I think if you look historically it is hard to say if this year is going to follow the historical seasonality, but typically cheese prices tend to peak going into the September timeframe and begin to drop off after that. ", "I think the good thing is our team did a very good job. We laid out for you I believe 2.5% to 3% commodity inflation for the U.S. back in December which had some pretty solid expectations for cheese prices. We're only a little bit above that right now based on what we see in the cheese market. We have hedged some positions as we always have said in the past, so that's definitely helping us. But we have assumed some normal historical trends, seasonality that cheese prices, some improvement in the back half of the year, and we're expecting a little bit more than 3% and a fraction of total U.S. commodity inflation for the year with the cheese prices that we have. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Larry Miller - RBC. ", " Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", " Thanks very much. My question was on the U.S. franchising initiative. You mentioned there was good demand for the Pizza Huts there. You said you're going to do about 1,400 stores over the next two years. Can you talk about the appetite by the U.S. franchise system? Would it be correct to assume that these are less profitable KFCs and Pizza Huts because you probably sold off some of the better ones? Is that correct? ", " Rick Carucci", " Let me answer the first part. Regarding where we are in the three-year process, we started with 1,500. We have about 1,000 to go. We still feel good about the process which is both targeting existing franchisees as well as looking at new franchisees to enter our system. ", "Versus historical, we always are selling on average lower-performing restaurants, but again remember we started with a fair amount of refranchising when we first found it, so when we got the ownership mix down to the 20% range, most of these are decent restaurants that we're refranchising, but still lower performers. The way that that works out is we're usually trading margin that's slightly above what we would get on a royalty rate basis, but then you get offsets in G&A to make us about neutral on an operating profit basis. ", " Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Can I ask one question about the emerging markets? You said they were growing at a good clip, 47% I think you said. Are we starting to see some of the losses in those markets narrow or still at a investment phase at this point? ", " David Novak", " It varies from market by market where it is in the investment cycle, so in total it is getting a bit better, but what you're going to see is certain markets where we've invested for awhile you will have actually rapid improvement in sales and profits, and then others we still need to put more money in. So, for example, it will be awhile before we get positive profit growth out of Russia while India and France we've been at it longer and we do expect to see some profit growth in those markets over the next few years. ", " Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets", "Just on Taco Bell relative to your internal plan for rate of recovery, how did that shape up? Where are you? ", " David Novak", " Well, I think the second quarter was less than what we had hoped because we had the setback from the publicity standpoint that we really weren't anticipating. We're inching forward at Taco Bell. We're working on our marketing plans and we expect to do significantly better, particularly in the fourth quarter because of the overlap. So steady as she goes. ", "As I mentioned in the last call, it takes you anywhere from six to nine months any time you have any kind of food safety issues that you have to overcome. I think we look at our brand measures, they're strong. The brand is in good shape. We just have to weather this period and get our marketing plans in line and make them stronger and we think we'll come back. We anticipate a very good year in 2008. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Victoria Hart - Merrill Lynch. ", " Victoria Hart - Merrill Lynch", "On the last call you had alluded to the fact that you would be interested in increasing the leverage. Can you comment on your capital structure and what you think you would be doing? ", " Rick Carucci", " Well, I will reiterate pretty much what we said last time. We're still studying that. We expect to have an answer by the end of the year. We do certainly have debt capability on our balance sheet. Depending on what we decide to do in terms of our ratings, if we stay within the investment grade category, we certainly have -- I think everyone has done calculations and said that we've got about $2 billion potential capability. We can see that obviously. ", "We're taking a look at everything to see what makes sense. We know we've got more of a franchise mix than we had several years ago, so our business, we believe, is definitely stronger in terms of returns, and steady and dependable cash flow. But again, we'll have an answer by the end of the year. ", " Victoria Hart - Merrill Lynch", " Do you want to keep within the same rating? ", " Rick Carucci", " Same thing. We'll have a full answer on that by the end of the year. ", " Victoria Hart - Merrill Lynch", " Alright. Can you speak to us a little bit more about the remodel at KFC? What the progress has been and how the franchisees have been coming along? ", " David Novak", "Just as a reminder for others, KFC has to upgrade its system by the middle of 2008. That's pretty much on schedule. We've got about 70% of the system completed at this time, and we're going to keep moving forward. We expect modest closures to occur during that period of time, hard to estimate exactly, but we think in the 200 range. We're also starting to see some franchise consolidations, some franchisees are buying out some others who may not be willing to upgrade their assets. ", " Victoria Hart - Merrill Lynch", "So when you say 200-range in terms of closures, is that with the current unit count on the franchisee level at KFC? Can you give us a sense for how many closures have been done to date? ", " David Novak", " None of that 200 is in the numbers yet so far, so it would be an additional 200 of our total unit count of 5,000 roughly for KFC. ", " Rick Carucci", " You should expect to see that later this year and in the first half of next year. ", " Victoria Hart - Merrill Lynch", "I apologize, I am not sure if you spoke to this earlier, but the dairy outlook for the Pizza Hut U.S.? ", " Rick Carucci", "We didn't specifically speak to dairy, but our expectation is for inflation to be a little bit above 3% for the full year which is just above what we expected coming into the year. ", " Victoria Hart - Merrill Lynch", " And chicken, is that fully contracted? ", " Rick Carucci", "Chicken we're pretty much locked through the balance of the year. But really the only category we're not is beef where we're subject to market conditions. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs. ", " Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "First in the U.S. as I listen to your prepared remarks and you go brand by brand, it seems as though you guys are looking at this as very much company-specific things you can improve upon to improve the sales trajectory there. I guess if we take a step back and comment a bit on the environment and maybe whether it is economic or otherwise and how competition might be influencing some of the results? What are you guys seeing? ", " David Novak", " Yes, I think that there is no doubt in the United States you got a very competitive market, and I think the consumer retail is being pressed on a number of fronts. Having said that, we still find that the market responds to good initiatives. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had a successful relaunch of the Pizzone and we feel we're making solid progress at KFC and Pizza Hut. We're recovering more slowly at Taco Bell than we would like although we are recovering, and that is the big challenge that we have in the U.S. right now. ", "Obviously value is very important to every brand at this point in time, so your value impression is key. The good news for Taco Bell is that we are top tier, number 1 in value, and that will bode well as we go into the future. ", "Basically what I am saying is we have got Pizza Hut and KFC making some pretty good progress, and the big challenge we have is Taco Bell, and we're confident we're going to right the ship and we're anticipating a stronger 2008. ", "Our profit goal in the U.S. is to grow at least 5%. This year we're going to be slightly positive, and that's not where we want it to be, but that's where we expect to be for the year, and we're focused on building new sales layers at each one of our businesses, and we think that 2008 will get back on track. ", " Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", " Are the challenges that you're seeing at Taco Bell influencing the timing or the results from any breakfast testing you might be doing? ", " David Novak", " We're testing our breakfast products right now. We're very confident that we're going to be able to make breakfast a national idea for Taco Bell. We went into a number of markets and got some great operating experience. The consumer response to the products is excellent. We've done a lot of research now. We're backing up and taking a look at the learning, and then we're going to go and do some concentrated, more focused test marketing as we go forward. ", "But the products that we have are just absolutely terrific, and we're confident that over time we can make breakfast work. As I said before, this is definitely the toughest day part to move into because you're dealing with such entrenched behavior and so we've got our work cut out, but we really believe that we can make this work. Greg and the team are very focused on making that happen, but it is not something we expect to roll out in 2008. ", " Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "I know you're not in the habit of giving quarterly comps for Pizza Hut and KFC any more, but can you give some sense of comfort that for both those brands year-to-date that comps are positive? ", "Tim Jerzyk ", " We disclosed everything we're going to do in terms of anything for the quarter and year-to-date. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns. ", " Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "A question again on China on the commodity cost pressures. How significant are the pork issues? What does your team say there in terms of how quickly that can correct and what the implications might be for chicken costs? ", " David Novak", "I am not really a pork expert, but the hardest piece of the pork, the issue really started about a year-and-a-half ago. They had some disease issues that affected their supply. That market hadn't been that profitable for awhile, so you also had some of the farmers struggling financially. ", "My understanding is that it is getting a bit better, but they did see about a 25% increase in pricing in pork during that period of time. So we think it is recovering, Joe, but I don't have a sense for when there will be a full recovery. ", " Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "The China G&A numbers looked a little high in the quarter. Anything unusual going on there? I realize you're growing the business and it is going to be up, but it was up a little bit higher than I thought it might be. ", " David Novak", " Yes, it was a bit high. What we've seen in China is we have what we call surges and plateaus in G&A. Part of the reason you get some surges there is we are investing for growth and new concepts. Right now, for example, we're investing G&A ahead of businesses like the Pizza Hut delivery business and East Dining, and then it usually moderates. For example, we expect lower growth in the back end of this year regarding China G&A. ", " Joseph Buckley - Bear Stearns", "On your forecast update, it looked like your refranchising proceeds you expect to be maybe $50 million to $100 million less. Is that U.S. driven? You mentioned Pizza Hut UK is on track for the second half launch of that effort. Could you talk about that and talk about if the total proceeds from refranchising over a couple-year period is impacted or is that just a timing shift to '08? ", " Rick Carucci", "Joe, the full program is absolutely in good shape. It is totally just timing and trying to identify some of the bigger transactions. We believe some of that may actually fall into '08, but the full program is absolutely right on track. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Ashley Woodruff - FBR. ", " Ashley Woodruff - FBR", "Just a couple more questions on China and pricing in particular. When you did take that price increase last year, is that something your customers even really noticed? Was it even too minor for them to notice and did you see any shift in the mix of items ordered? ", " Rick Carucci", "We saw very little impact to the business and obviously China has been a great growth business for us, and you didn't really see a bending of the trend. ", " Ashley Woodruff - FBR", "Very recently with the increase in food cost inflation, what have the competitors been doing? The other big chain there, but even just on a very local basis? Have they been raising prices? ", " Rick Carucci", "Definitely there has been price increases, for example, at the supermarket level on poultry and pork and the consumers have definitely felt that. That's why my sense is they almost seem to be expecting a price increase because they've seen it on the supermarket side. In terms of competitors we're probably the big dog and they may be watching us. ", " Ashley Woodruff - FBR", "Lastly on China, what is the government doing with high inflation? We've seen a couple of press reports on the government trying to put in price controls. Has that had an impact, and do you expect them to be able to keep the prices from increasing further? ", " David Novak", " We haven't seen anything to that anticipates any price controls or anything in that nature in China, so we don't see the government making any big moves. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", " Thank you very much. First just a question on the U.S. operating profit and your guidance. Just looking at back half of the year, obviously you have some comfort in improving trends. You mentioned some productivity initiatives that you have in place. ", "I am just wondering, other than productivity improvements it seems like you're anticipating second half performance. Just wondering if you have seen that in recent months, some support from trends moving in the right direction? Thanks. ", " Rick Carucci", "David commented that we are seeing progress on the KFC and Pizza Hut side. As you look at the balance of the year we're looking at two things and David commented on this a little bit. One is improving sales trends. We think we like our marketing programs. The second piece is we're overlapping both weak sales and weak profits, particularly in the fourth quarter last year. You should factor that in when you look at our balance of the year. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Also it seems like you have a $10 million reduction in the closure and impairment expense this year versus last, which definitely helped the operating profit. I am just wondering how you look at that for the back half of the year and do you see further significant reductions? ", " Rick Carucci", "That's a full year reduction, and it is hard to predict that, Jeff, in terms of when those will happen. The best thing to do is just really take a look at the prior year quarterly spend and use that as your guide. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "A last thing on YRI. A couple of moving parts there but food costs seems to be down huge for three straight quarters while it seems like payroll costs are up significantly the past two quarters. ", " Rick Carucci", " Yes, that's the impact of the Pizza Hut UK business now being included in the P&L. That's primarily the impact there. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", " It is shifting from one to the other? I would be surprised you would see it move from one to the other. ", " Rick Carucci", " It is just a different business. You're adding a pretty significant Pizza Hut business. ", " David Novak", " When it was a joint venture, it was not in the margin numbers. Now it is in the margin numbers and it is a significant part of the mix. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", " You would expect over the next few quarters that would normalize? ", " Rick Carucci", "We acquired it last October, so the benefit will start to go away basically in the fourth quarter, and then by first quarter next year it will have normalized. ", " Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Lastly you mentioned multi-branding very briefly in your commentary and I know that used to be category-leading brands, multi-brand focus, just wondering your outlook and what we should think about in term of the impact that has on results going forward, if it has much at all? Thanks. ", " David Novak", " Where we see multi-branding playing a primary role will be in the development of new units in the U.S., primarily with KFC and Taco Bell combinations leading that effort. Our goal is to get to net new unit development in the U.S. with Taco Bell and Taco Bell KFC combinations really leading the way. ", " Rick Carucci", "That's the case on the quick service side. On the Pizza Hut side we also expect to see more and more penetration of Wing Street with Pizza Hut as a multi-brand partner. ", " David Novak", " We're having outstanding success with the Pizza Hut Wing Street restaurant conversions. So the franchisees are getting more and more excited about that. Our goal is to try to scale that idea on as much of a national basis as we can. The two big combinations in summary are Pizza Hut Wing Street and also KFC/Taco Bell. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Tom O\u2019Neill \u2013 Barclay\u2019s Capital. ", " Tom O\u2019Neill - Barclay\u2019s Capital", "Based on your answers to the capital structure question it seems that you left the window open for your rating to either be investment grade or non-investment grade. There is no question as I watched your progress over the years with your strong free cash flow, you really created a much more stable cash flow generating organization. ", "In terms of the capital structure review though, we've had a lot of names go private in both the retail and restaurant space. You're talking about fine tuning the balance sheet or could this possibly end up in a situation where you're no longer a publicly traded entity? ", " David Novak", "I would say, why would we mess with happiness? We have a great business. We like being a public company. We like our opportunities over the long term, and there is nothing that's keeping us from continuing to be a great value for our shareholders. ", " Rick Carucci", "As Tim said, we're going to study the capital structure. We are leaning towards staying investment grade. ", " Tom O\u2019Neill - Barclay\u2019s Capital", " Thanks for that clarification. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer - UBS. ", " David Palmer - UBS ", "Is there any update that you can give us on your confidence level on Pizza Hut? You were just noting that your biggest challenge is Taco Bell, and I am wondering if that might say anything positive about how Pizza Hut may be evolving in your mind? In particular, can you comment about how you feel about the pipeline in marketing as well as innovation pipeline versus where it might have been six months or a year ago? And if you feel more confident, why you might feel more confident about Pizza Hut? ", " David Novak", " I think the team is really working on the right things at Pizza Hut. We've got basically three areas that we're attacking with I think pretty good success from everything that I can see. One is just the whole value proposition. We just launched Pizzones and you saw the abundant value propositions we had for that business or for that brand, and we think we have Pizzone and nobody else has Pizzone, which is another nice thing about that. ", "We have other initiatives and tests on the value front. As I mentioned before, that's where the real battleground is in the categories. You've got a win on that front and then also come in with innovation. We've been lacking on really true value initiatives, and we now believe that we are getting closer at having more in our arsenal as we go forward. ", "The second thing that we're very excited about is that we did reposition the brand around America's Favorite, getting more. All the consumer data we're seeing tells us we're on the right track there. Nobody else can say they're America's Favorite pizza, and in a category that if you let it go commodity or can get more commoditized, have you to differentiate yourself, and I think the team is very committed and coming up with more and more ways to demonstrate we're America's favorite because we always give you more. I think you will see more and more news on that front. ", "The third thing we're excited about is we really do think we have an asset transformational idea with Wing Street. It is working in our delivery, in carryout units, and also working now in the restaurant units. So we see that becoming a bigger and bigger player in our franchise system down the road. ", "The pizza category, as I said in the past, is always competitive. It is the toughest one we're in with two very strong national competitors. I think it is always going to be a dog fight. We're not predicting robust growth at Pizza Hut, but we think we can get on that 2% to 3% same-store sales growth track with some consistency as we go forward. Obviously we'll try to do better than that, but clearly we've been trying get ourselves in the positive territory, and we want to get there and stay there, and keep building on that. ", "Frankly, I feel a lot better about Pizza Hut than I have felt in a long time in terms of just the direction that they're taking, but the proof is in the pudding for the long term. ", " David Palmer - UBS ", " Rick, a quick question on food costs. You guys have done a great job, your team and your supply guys have done a great job on the U.S. food cost side for '07. I am wondering, given all that we're seeing out there, does that mean '08 might be some tough laps on the good hedging and contracts you set for '07? Is the bias definitely to the upside on the 3% to 3.5% you got going this year? ", " Rick Carucci", " Yes. It is really hard to predict what's going to happen on the commodity side. Again, it will depend as we get into the balance of the year when we decide what contract to sign and for how long to sign it. We have to wait and see. We do have, as you mentioned, we would like to thank you for complimenting our team. We do have a good team that works on it, and they work on it for both us and our franchisees. ", "What we try to do as well is to make sure we have productivity initiatives that continue to work on two fronts. One is within the supply chain itself, to make sure we try to do things, for example, at KFC, utilize dark meat and bigger birds and then also productivity outside the food chain to combat inflation. We're working hard on all of those fronts. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley. ", " Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "A question for Tim or Rick. As you're looking at your capital structure, I am sure you have seen a lot of the restaurants do these securitization of franchise fees at 5.3% to 5.5%. We really haven't seen a lot of this in the international market. Is there a barrier to that and can do you this for the YRI business? ", "Tim Jerzyk", " We really are not going to go that route, probably either in the U.S. or the international market. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia. ", " Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia Securities", "My first one relates to the evolution of the Red Roofs and Wing Street's role in that over the next few years. Assuming that's the direction you go, is there a way you can work with the franchisees, incentivize them? Is that necessary? How do you see that evolution occurring? ", " David Novak", "The best way to incentivized the franchisees is to give them unit economics to get them excited about the propositions, and that's why we believe we have a national proposition now with Pizza Hut Wing Street. We've been doing a lot of testing ourselves. Now the franchisees are opening up units. We have one franchisee in Texas who really led the way on this. He has given his presentations to the franchise community, and that's going to be the biggest driving force. ", "We're going to do everything we can to work with the franchisees to try to scale the ideas as fast as we can. Obviously the more we can scale it, the more we'll be able to advertise it and the more we can make it a more powerful idea and differentiated idea in a category that's obviously very competitive. ", " Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia Securities", "One other question on Taco Bell. When you look at the opportunity to recapture lapsed users in the Northeast, is it the kind of thing where you would consider stepping up your efforts there promotionally as we move into the second half? Or is it just a natural recovery against the easier comparisons? ", " David Novak", " I think we've looked at these things in the past and for someone who is not very patient -- and I am not very patient, as most people would attest to -- you have to tell yourself to give it time. I think that's our biggest ally in this whole thing is to let time takes its course. There is some local promotions that's going to be done, and we're looking at other ways that we can accelerate the timing of the time, okay, but it is going to take us six to nine months, and the good news is we've got six months out of the way. ", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Jason West - Deutsche Bank. ", " Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Can you give us the profit growth in the Mainland China business ex currency? I think you said it was 20% on a reported basis. ", "Tim Jerzyk", " You can call us back after the call and we will get that for you. The difference is probably pretty close to the total division number. Most of the currency change is in the Chinese currency. ", " Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Can you update us on where you stand on extended hours at KFC and if you expect that to have any kind of lift in the back half and what that might be? ", " David Novak", " We're in the midst now on a geographical basis, citywide basis expanding late night in a number of our company markets, so we expect that to have some positive impact in the second half of the year. ", " Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "But it is just in company markets right now? ", " David Novak", " We're doing it with the franchisees in those markets. We try to go DMA by DMA basis, but it is being company led. ", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Glen Petraglia - Citigroup. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "It is just a quick follow-up. In the release you mentioned labor inflation in China. Now I believe every year there is some sort of mandated labor wage increase in China. Can you maybe comment on, are you seeing inflation above that rate, and what's causing it? ", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, the inflation rate we're seeing in terms of labor is pretty much consistent with what we've seen over the last several years. There has really not been much change there. The only other thing going on within that division P&L, keep in mind as Rick mentioned earlier, you got the other two small parts of that division; Taiwan and Thailand are not doing so well, and that's impacting that. ", " Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "David Novak", "Let me wrap this up. I appreciate everybody on the call. We're on track for another year of strong EPS growth with the current forecast of 12% growth up from our previous guidance of 11%. I think it is demonstrating once again the reliability of our global portfolio to deliver consistent EPS performance. ", "The overall consumer dynamics outside the United States have never been stronger, as shown by the strong top line sales from our Mainland China business and exceptional system sales results from our YRI division. We are making steady improvement towards full recovery in the U.S. businesses and look forward to a much better year in 2008 from a profit and sales standpoint. ", "I want you to rest assured that we are putting plans in place to get better performance in the U.S. going forward and doing everything we can to make sure that all of our brands have growth performance for 2008.

My name is Jennifer and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.", "I would also like to advise that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s expectations based on currently available data. However, actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties. The information in this conference call related to projections or other forward-looking statements may be relied on subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release last night and may continue to be used while this call remains in the active portion of the company\u2019s website.", "On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. Now I would like to turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak", "Thank you, Tim and good morning, everybody. I am pleased to report that we had an exceptional third quarter, with 16% growth in operating profit and 20% EPS growth, demonstrating once again the ability of our global portfolio to consistently generate growth.", "Once again, our Mainland China and YRI businesses led the way in the Yum! portfolio. With such strong results, I am also very happy to report that we are increasing our full year EPS outlook to 13% growth from 12% previously. Importantly, for the fourth quarter, we expect to see continuing solid profit growth in the range of 8% to 10%, including much improved performance from our U.S. business.", "Now let\u2019s review the third quarter. In Mainland China, we grew system sales by a very strong 26% in local currency terms and are on our way to another year of opening at least 375 new restaurants, further distancing ourselves from the competition for both KFC and Pizza Hut.", "Overall, we expect to see record new units opening from our China division in 2007. The health of our Mainland China business is strong, has very good momentum, and is coping well with short-term spikes in food inflation.", "I would like to thank all of you who made it to the investor conference we held in Beijing last month. Believing is really seeing the power of our Chinese operations and the love our customers have for our brands.", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we grew system same-store sales 7% with outstanding quarterly system sales growth of 11% in local currency terms, and we are headed towards another year of new unit development that leads the industry. In fact, we not only expect 2007 to be the eighth straight year that the YRI division has added 700 or more new units, but we also believe that this will be a record year for YRI in new unit openings, breaking the previous record set in 2003 by opening over 850 new restaurants.", "No other global business has matched the unit opening volume of YRI and the annual consistency. YRI has become a broad-based development machine. Think about it; for 2007, we expect to open 150 new units in our Asia franchise markets, 80 units in the Middle East, 60 units in Europe, 40 units in Russia, and so on.", "Importantly, for the third quarter, our U.S. business improved versus the first half of this year. In fact, both our system same-store sales and operating profit growth turned positive this quarter. Now, we are not yet where we need to be but we are seeing signs of progress across each brand and obviously expect Taco Bell to have better results in the fourth quarter.", "Now let\u2019s review what we see at each of our businesses and talk about our plans and trends.In the China division, specifically Mainland China, our KFC and Pizza Hut brands that created western QSR and casual dining categories in that market, continued to generate exceptional results, driving Mainland China system same-store sales growth of 11% and Mainland China operating profit growth of 29%. This result was achieved in spite of a challenging commodity cost environment in Mainland China that we highlighted during last quarter\u2019s conference call.", "As of the third quarter, KFC has nearly 2,000 restaurants across 420 cities and growing. In fact, we fully expect KFC in Mainland China will end this year with more than 2,100 restaurants.", "With consumer reach and awareness at all-time highs and extremely attractive unit economics, there is plenty of room to drive brand awareness even deeper into the consumer base and build upon our leadership position with the QSR category in that market.", "Our 20 year anniversary marketing efforts have only reinforced our strong ties to the Chinese customers. I hope you can see that we are not resting on our success thus far but we are very focused on continuing to expand KFC as a powerful brand that is very much a part of the Chinese culture.", "Now on to the other category innovator; we now have almost 300 Pizza Hut casual dining restaurants in Mainland China, the undisputed leader in the category, and we grew units by 31% versus last year during the third quarter. We are now in over 60 cities. With strong unit economics, we were able to open restaurants in lower tier cities where there is no western competitor in sight and we don\u2019t expect to see them any time soon.", "Our biggest consumer issue is the length of wait time during dinner. The good news is that it simply means more growth opportunities. We are also leveraging our assets with the expansion of tea time, where our table service gives us a strong advantage versus Starbucks as we serve coffee, tea, fruit drinks, and afternoon snacks.", "Now let me give an update on where we are with our delivery business, Pizza Hut home service, which we started about three years ago and we already have 43 Pizza Hut home service restaurants in six cities, and we\u2019ll be going into more cities with even more units. We are looking to bring game-changing innovation to the delivery category, just as we have done with our two established brands.", "In fact, we recently added our second call center and a [go-to-go] commissary to handle the expected expansion of this business. We are doing everything we can to capitalize on the convenience and affordability of the delivery occasion, which will become more and more important as that economy continues to grow.", "Finally, we continue to expand East Dawning, the Chinese quick service restaurant brand that we created. We now have eight restaurants in the Shanghai market. In fact, we will be airing our first East Dawning advertising soon. The commercial is ready to go. We will be testing TV in Shanghai to build brand awareness and differentiate ourselves from the local competitors.", "We still have much to do on both the sales and margin fronts but we are feeling more and more confident each day that East Dawning will be successful.", "To summarize, our China business had a great third quarter with reported operating profit growth of 28%, even in spite of a challenging commodity cost environment. That is outstanding performance by any measure. As we will talk about later, we do have at least a short-term issue with commodities, but our long-term opportunity remains unparalleled in the retail space.", "We believe that with the combination of the tremendous business we have created and the growth prospects for the Mainland China market, this will enable us some day to have more than 20,000 Yum! restaurants in Mainland China. Believe me, this number is more than realistic when you consider Mainland China has over 1.3 billion people, with growing wealth and significant personal savings, while McDonald\u2019s has 14,000 restaurants serving only 300 million consumers in the U.S. and, as you can clearly see, we have the opportunity.", "Now on to our Yum! Restaurants International division, or YRI. We are very pleased to see another very strong quarterly performance from our YRI portfolio. For the third quarter, we achieved 11% growth in system sales, local currency basis, well ahead of our ongoing target of at least 5% growth. In fact, the growth continues to be broad-based across our 113 markets.", "For example, our Middle East franchise business unit drove third quarter system sales growth of 24%; South Africa was up 27%; our Caribbean Latin American business was up 12%; and in Asia, our sales increased 12%.", "One of the contributing factors to this strong system sales growth is the number of new restaurants that we are adding. YRI opened up 193 new restaurants in the third quarter and virtually all of our 515 new restaurant openings year-to-date, or 92% of them, were by our franchise partners.", "We are on track to add more than 850 new KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in 2007. With such strong unit expansion and same-store sales growth across our franchise markets, franchise fees grew by 9% in local currency terms.", "Now let\u2019s talk a bit about some of the key emerging markets. We are seeing excellent results from our Russia business as we convert the Rostik Restaurants to co-branded Rostik-KFC units. In fact, the mix of the KFC menu items in these converted units is over 80%, a testament to the global appeal of our KFC brand.", "We are also continuing to invest in our India business and build upon the success of our recent KFC advertising test.", "As for KFC in France, we continue to see record average unit volumes with our 52 restaurants and great results from our new units. We believe that our investments and patience are starting to pay off and there is no doubt that we are well on our way to building great businesses in these markets. We are confident these markets will be key contributors to YRI\u2019s growth in a few years.", "One of YRI\u2019s recent challenges has been Pizza Hut U.K. We are pleased to report that we are starting to see progress in the United Kingdom. In fact, we achieved third quarter same-store sales growth of 8%, driven by the successful launch of Cheesy Bites Fondue. We are making progress, although it is a little early to call it a victory. However, as I\u2019ve said before, given the process and discipline that the new team is implementing, we are confident that we are moving towards more consistent performance.", "Just like our Mainland China business, YRI still has a very long runway for unit and profit growth. This is an important aspect of the YRI business. As a point of reference, we have over 20,000 restaurants in the U.S. serving 300 million consumers, while our YRI business has only 12,000 restaurants serving 4 billion consumers.", "In addition, we intend to extend that long runway of YRI growth by developing the Taco Bell brand into a third global brand. In fact, we just recently opened our first test unit in Mexico and ground work is being laid for the Middle East, India, Spain, and Japan.", "Now on to the United States businesses. Our U.S. business improved versus the first half of this year, as third quarter system same-store sales and operating profit were both up 1%. At Taco Bell, frankly our recovery is taking a little longer than expected. As we noted in the release last night, we do expect Taco Bell performance will improve in the fourth quarter.", "The good news is that for the vast majority of the past three weeks, our franchisees have experienced slightly positive same-store sales growth. Part of this we believe is due to the Cheesy Beefy Melt, a great product at a great value price of $1.99. It is actually mixing at a level which is second only to the highly successful Crunchwrap as a new product.", "In addition to the upcoming soft overlap, we have some very good product news that is just ahead, as well as some good tactical plans to excite our customers. Keep in mind the World Series is just ahead and Taco Bell is a Major League Baseball sponsor. Importantly, we believe the team is setting up well for next year on a number of fronts and the recent positive momentum is a very good sign.", "Looking ahead to 2008, we have a strong pipeline of new and different ideas for this category-leading brand. Make no mistake about it. Obviously, I\u2019m tasking myself and the team for much better results at Taco Bell going forward.", "Now on to KFC. Overall, this will be a slightly positive year for the KFC system with the franchisees performing better than company stores. We have been looking at some significant long-term and sustainable growth opportunities for KFC in the U.S. This includes actively testing for growth opportunities in the area of value, more nutritionally balanced options, on-the-go, and the lunch occasion, where we believe we are under-represented.", "Importantly, on the asset front, we are pleased to report that the KFC U.S. system is on track to complete all targeted asset upgrades by the middle of next year. We will have a much more up-to-date KFC U.S. asset base very shortly.", "Finally, given the confidence in the leadership of the KFC management team, the franchisees agreed to increase their national television advertising spending by half-a-point beginning in 2008, which will give us a much more complete national calendar. This only happens when the franchisees have credibility in the direction the company is taking.", "At Pizza Hut, the successful relaunch of Pizone and local marketing initiatives during the third quarter delivered category-beating results. Looking longer term, as the category leader with the proven track record of pizza innovations, the Pizza Hut team believes we can deliver more consistent positive results through a combination of building differentiated sales layers, like our highly successful Wing Street option.", "In 2007, we have tested and developed a new value layer and other meal options to go along with Wing Street. Pizza Hut franchisees also agreed to increase their national television advertising spend by three-quarters of a point to introduce these as permanent sales layers, starting in 2008. This really shows the confidence that our franchise partners have in what we intend to accomplish with this great brand.", "I feel better about the direction and vision for the Pizza Hut brand than I have in years.", "For the U.S. overall, we will be ending 2007 with improving momentum and entering 2008 with solid plans. Full year U.S. operating profit is likely to be even with last year. We expect to do a lot better next year, given that this year\u2019s operating profit is expected to be flat.", "Finally, in addition to building sales layers and bringing more relevant and exciting product news to our U.S. consumers, we are also focused on ensuring that our company restaurants are earning their right to own, reducing our U.S. company ownership down from 26% in the beginning of 2006 to 17% by the end of 2008, which will improve our returns from this business and put our U.S. restaurants in the hands of good operators.", "To summarize, the power of our global portfolio of leading restaurant brands continues to generate consistent EPS growth and significant free cash from our businesses. This year we will generate a record $1.4 billion in cash from operating activities, while investing in the growth of our businesses and maintaining our brand assets around the world.", "With the strength of our global portfolio that continues to generate growth and a balance sheet that is stronger than ever, I am pleased to report that yesterday our board approved a significant increase in share repurchase authorization from our normal $500 million to a new $1.25 billion authorization. This authorization is part of the company\u2019s two-year plan to buy back up to $4 billion of our shares, reducing our share count further by as much as 20%, adding to the 12% reduction we have achieved during the past three years. This showcases our financial strength when you consider that we are doing this in a year in which we already doubled our quarterly dividend.", "We expect to finance part of this two-year share repurchase plan through an increased level of debt, and we believe that the combination of our track record of consistent growth with high returns and strong free cash flow will enable us to remain an investment grade company, even with increased leverage.", "Finally, as we look forward into 2008, we expect to continue to build on our track record of consistently delivering against our target of at least 10% EPS growth each year. We are confident about our business around the world because of the investments that we have put in place to drive sustainable sales and profit growth.", "Specifically, we remain focused on our four key strategies; building dominant restaurant brands in China, driving profitable expansion and growth at YRI, improving U.S. brands positionings and returns, and driving high return on invested capital and strong shareholder payout.", "Now I will turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer, who will take you through the numbers. Rick.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. I am going to review three areas today. First, our third quarter results and preview of our fourth quarter; second, the 2007 full year outlook; and third, our new capital structure plan and our full year cash flow expectations.", "Looking at the third quarter, we were certainly pleased to report EPS growth of 20%, led by quality operating performance. Third quarter operating profit growth of 16% lapped a strong third quarter in 2006 when our operating profit increased 11%. That\u2019s two-year growth of 27% in operating profit, which certainly is strong performance by virtually any standard. In addition, operating margin improved one half point versus the strong results from a year ago.", "As you look at the numbers this quarter, overall Yum! results were clearly driven by strong operating performances from China and Yum! Restaurants International. In addition, the reduction in our share count of 2% and a favorable foreign currency translation that added $0.02 to EPS also contributed to Q3 performance.", "Now let\u2019s look at the third quarter by our three business segments. We will also cover items that we expect will impact these segments in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s first talk about our China division.", "In the third quarter, China division operating profits were up 28%. Looking at just our Mainland China business separately, profit growth was 29%. Top line growth was exceptional, driven by both very strong unit growth and double-digit same-store sales growth.", "In the written disclosures of the earnings release, you can specifically see our Mainland China performance for key measures in addition to the total China division results.", "Our Mainland China business continues to be a key growth driver for Yum!'s overall results. These results are driven largely by the exceedingly strong competitive positions of both KFC in the western QSR category and Pizza Hut in the western casual dining category. Our China division contributed over 50% of Yum!'s overall operating growth this quarter.", "One issue that affected business in the third quarter was increased commodity inflation. There have been issues in Mainland China related to pork with both tight supplies and increased prices. This contributed to greater demand for chicken and therefore higher prices. In addition, domestic China chicken supply was further impacted by lower-than-expected outputs, as well as increased exports to other markets. This led to a significant spike in chicken prices.", "We believe this impact is short-term in nature. In the third quarter, food costs increased by one full percentage point versus last year. We\u2019re able to offset half of that impact overall as restaurant margin declined by one-half percentage point.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect to see even higher chicken cost than in the third quarter. This will translate into lower margins in Q4 as we are estimating about a two-point decline versus prior year in restaurant margin.", "To summarize, in Mainland China we have both very strong top line performance as well as some higher costs in the near-term. We are also benefiting from a strong Chinese currency.", "Overall, unit economics remain very strong and we are continuing to rapidly expand both KFC and Pizza Hut, as well as develop new brands.", "Our development pipeline looks strong and we expect to exceed our target for 400 new builds in the China division for 2007. Net net, we are as bullish as ever about our China business and the portfolio of brands we are building in a market which is likely the world\u2019s biggest opportunity for building restaurant brands.", "For Yum! Restaurants International, or YRI, the third quarter was another excellent quarter with reported operating profit growth of 21%, lapping 22% growth last year. Even if you exclude foreign currency benefit, this year\u2019s operating profit growth was 14%, lapping 20% last year. We believe this is an indication of the underlying strength of this great business.", "Our top line performance at YRI was very strong, with system sales growth of 11% in local currency terms lapping a very strong plus 9% last year -- clearly not an easy comparison. Importantly, our systems sales growth strength is broad-based with very few markets under-performing.", "Overall, our franchise business in YRI grew third quarter profit by 12%. This was led by a very strong profit growth in most markets, including our Asia franchise business unit, the Middle East, Europe, South Africa, and the Caribbean Latin America markets. Our company markets in total grew profit by 14%, excluding the positive impact of for-ex. This was led by strong performance in Australia, Mexico, and both the KFC and Pizza Hut businesses in the U.K. market.", "Company restaurant margins declined slightly due to the inclusion of our wholly-owned Pizza Hut U.K. business, versus last year when it was a 50-50 joint venture. Excluding this impact, our margin rose by 0.7 percentage points.", "Finally, our third quarter was achieved despite higher G&A costs related to the costs of owning the U.K. Pizza Hut business, investment spending in Russia, India, and Taco Bell International start-up costs. These are businesses which will potentially be large sources of future growth for YRI.", "We have seen continued growth in these emerging markets, while still a small segment of YRI\u2019s business, system sales for the emerging markets grew at 30% in the third quarter.", "Hopefully, you can see that YRI is performing well. Like in China, our competitive position at YRI continues to strengthen. Our development pipeline is strong and we expect to open over 850 restaurants this year. This business is already extremely valuable to Yum! and we are building for future growth while also delivering excellent results today.", "Now on to our U.S. business; overall, our U.S. performance improved versus the first half of this year, with 1% growth in both same-store sales and operating profit. We were happy to see this expected improvement but overall results were still below our ongoing target for growth.", "The good news is that we expect further improvement for our U.S. results in the fourth quarter, particularly at Taco Bell, our largest U.S. brand. As you can tell from the details of our release last night, the operating environment is a bit challenging, with headwinds from both commodity inflation and wage rate inflation. We are pleased to report that each of our brand teams is working very hard to stay ahead of the curve in this environment. We clearly have to play an A-game operationally during these times, including being very diligent with menu pricing, menu mix management, executing against productivity opportunities, and reducing overhead cost structure where it makes sense.", "One example I will cite is that Pizza Hut in the U.S., we are challenged by very high cheese prices and minimum wage hikes. The team has offset these factors by doing a great job of eliminating unprofitable discounting. By managing these items, our U.S. business was able to show positive profitability in the third quarter, despite commodity inflation of $16 million.", "In terms of top line performance in the U.S., as you just heard from David, each brand is developing sustainable sales layers. Getting to a higher level of performance in our U.S. business in terms of top line growth and higher returns is a clear priority.", "Overall for Yum! in the fourth quarter, we expect continued solid operating performance despite continued inflation challenges. We expect fourth quarter operating profit growth in the range of 8% to 10%, led by solid performance in each of our three businesses.", "Now let\u2019s review our final 2007 outlook. First, let me briefly reiterate our Yum! long-term growth model, which includes 20% operating profit growth from our China division, 10% operating profit growth from YRI, and 5% operating growth from our U.S. business. This adds up to 9% to 10% growth in annual operating profit as our target.", "At this point for 2007, we expect first that China will exceed its full year target of 20% on a reported basis. YRI will clearly exceed its full year target of 10% growth, likely exceeding 15% growth in reported terms, and U.S. profit will be even with last year.", "In terms of global development, we now expect to open more than 1,200 new units this year in China and YRI combined. For the full year 2007, we increased our full year EPS guidance to plus 13%, or $1.65 per share. Our previous guidance was 12% growth. This would mark the sixth consecutive year of at least 12% EPS growth.", "Now let\u2019s talk about our capital structure plans and cash flow expectations for the year. As you saw in our release last night, we have decided to increase the level of balance sheet leverage from where it is today. We have studied this at length and believe we have a structure that is very supportive of our global business for the foreseeable future, yet provides the degree of comfort and what we like to call sleep-at-night durability. At the same time, it does test our balance sheet to contribute to the overall Yum! enterprise with a more efficient capital structure, while meeting our investment grade target.", "We see this as an opportunity to return even more cash to our shareholders and increase shareholder value as we acquire the shares below intrinsic value.", "Now let\u2019s talk about what everyone really appreciates about our business, and that\u2019s our great cash flow. For 2007, you should expect another year of substantial levels of free cash available for payout to our shareholders. We expect to return at least $1.3 billion in cash for 2007, which is even more cash than the $1.1 billion returned in 2006.", "For the full year 2007, we expect a 4% reduction in our share count due to share buy-backs and our dividend yield is substantially higher than it was a year ago, now about 1.7%.", "To wrap up, we expect a very successful year of operating performance from our global performance. We expect 2007 will be considered as another year of consistent financial performance, another year of impressive global growth, and another year with strong global cash flow returned to shareholders.", "As a reminder, we are planning our upcoming investor meeting in New York in December. At that meeting, David, Tim Jerzyk and I will review the following: our 2008 outlook, key trends for Yum! and the industry, and an update of our U.S. refranchising and our outlook for ownership plans using our earn-the-right-to-own principle as a guiding light.", "Back to you, David, for a quick overview of our 2008 expectations.", "David Novak", "Okay, Rick, thank you very much. Now, for those of you who follow our company, you know that our annual target is to commit to doing at least 10% earnings per share growth. Before we field any questions, I\u2019d like to take a couple of minutes to talk about 2008 and to share four key reasons why I believe we will continue to deliver at least 10% EPS growth into next year.", "First, China and YRI have demonstrated in 2007 that they are sustainable growth engines, able to overlap strong performances from 2006. This year, they will both open a record number of new units and deliver solid same-store sales growth, providing us with even more scale in more countries and territories, giving us even greater marketing clout to help feed the momentum for next year.", "Second, our U.S. business is well-poised to deliver stronger results in 2008, with Taco Bell gaining transaction momentum as we speak and Pizza Hut and KFC positioned much more strongly than in recent years to demonstrate sustainable growth.", "Third, we are embarking on our most ambitious share buy-back program yet, with plans to return a record level of cash to our shareholders over the next two years.", "And fourth, we have a strong track record of delivering on our commitments, with 2007 representing the sixth consecutive year of exceeding our EPS growth target of at least 10%.", "These four factors give me tremendous confidence to reaffirm this goal for 2008 and we look forward to talking about all of this in more detail at our upcoming conference.", "So with that, what I would like to do now is open it up and answer any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ashley Woodruff with FBR.", "Ashley Woodruff - Friedman Billings Ramsay", "Thank you. A couple of questions on China and margins in particular; when you start to look into 2008, and I know the commodity markets are difficult to predict, but based on what you are seeing now on the supply side, demand for chicken, what are your expectations as we go into certainly early 2008? Should we continue to see this type of pressure that you are looking for in the fourth quarter?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We actually really don\u2019t know. We do expect to have high chicken costs in the first month of the year, because have contracted to that time frame, but we are not sure how long this bubble is going to exist, so we are just -- obviously we are spending a lot of time looking at that now and are ready to adjust to several scenarios, but we really don\u2019t know what the environment is going to be beyond the first month of the year.", "Ashley Woodruff - Friedman Billings Ramsay", "So you haven\u2019t started to enter into any contracts for 2008 yet?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Except for the first month of the year, right.", "Ashley Woodruff - Friedman Billings Ramsay", "Right, and then also looking at just China store margins longer term, say over the next three to five years, as you -- your margins have been much higher than average certainly than any of your other markets, and part of that\u2019s been the great demand, strong same-store sales. As you start to grow into that demand through the unit growth, should we expect just naturally for those store level margins to come down in the China division?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I certainly don\u2019t expect that. Clearly, as we\u2019ve said for a long time, we are still at the early stages of China development. We have a couple thousand restaurants in a market of 1.3 billion, so we think there is a lot of room there. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re in the developing stage, per se.", "The second piece of it is our competitive position in China is extremely strong. If you really look at it, it is really just McDonald\u2019s and KFC in the QSR space, western QSR space, so we don\u2019t see any special pressures there.", "I do think that the way we are going to get the margins will be a bit different in the sense of I do think that there\u2019s likely to be a little bit more pressure on food inflation over time, but with that we\u2019ve taken very little pricing and so far, the pricing we have taken, the market\u2019s been able to absorb as the economy there continues to grow.", "So I feel pretty bullish about China margins over the medium and longer term.", "Ashley Woodruff - Friedman Billings Ramsay", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Ashley. Jennifer, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Wilson with Tiburon Research.", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Yes, I was wondering if you could explain why U.S. G&A costs declined quite a bit dramatically in Q3. And also, you said your operating profit goal is 8% to 10% I believe in Q4. What is your store margin goal in the U.S. division in Q4? Thank you.", "Richard T. Carucci", "We don\u2019t provide guidance in terms of restaurant margin by quarter, certainly by segment. We gave you an update on guidance for the full year in the earnings release. There\u2019s a link in the earnings release, and we said that U.S. and China margins would decline slightly for the year, so that\u2019s as close as we are going to get on that.", "The performance, as we said earlier though, we expect the U.S. to be better, solid operating profit growth in Q4, and an improvement in Taco Bell, so overall performance will be better.", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "And G&A costs in Q3?", "Richard T. Carucci", "G&A costs, if you look at the segment of the earnings release last night on the update on refranchising, keep in mind we\u2019ve refranchised almost 700 stores in the U.S. since the beginning of \u201906, and G&A reductions related to that tend to lag as you refranchise, so now you are beginning to see the impact, the cumulative impact of that.", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Okay, appreciate it. Thanks for taking my call.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please, Jennifer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. A couple of quick follow-ups on China; first, Rick, you mentioned price to date has been pretty low. I think last quarter you were talking about using price to offset some of the inflation, so there was some discussion around that. Can you quantify how much price contributed to the 11% same-store sales gain at this point?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We don\u2019t comment on the exact percentages but when we did take price increase in the third quarter, it was higher than our normal price increase and the market, as you can see from the sales results, did respond okay to that price increase. Now that price increase is not enough to cover the extra spike we had in chicken costs in the fourth quarter but you can see it mostly offset the first spike we had in the third quarter.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "So to that point I guess, Rick, it seems as though the spike in chicken has been more due to more demand from the pork commodity inflating. What do your suppliers say as they look out from a pork standpoint? And to the extent that that normalizes a bit, might we be in a position that there\u2019s a risk of the demand for chicken reversing if pricing starts to go up here and pork stabilizes a bit?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Again, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m an expert on pork prices. I think what\u2019s happening though, Steven, is there is unusual pricing in both right now so I don\u2019t think you could look at this as a normal market. The prices are up in the 40% range for pork and chicken, so I think that the suppliers, quite frankly, this is a bit new for them.", "The advantage that chicken does have over pork is that the growing cycle is a lot shorter so you have a better chance for the market to correct itself more quickly in chicken than it has on the pork side.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then Taco Bell U.S., I guess David, you made the comment that franchise stores over the last few weeks have shown improvement. I think you said positive sales more from product initiatives, I guess. Could you just comment on company stores, why those might still be lagging?", "David Novak", "I think our franchise system, I guess we have 80% of our stores, or more like 75% of the stores are franchise, 25% are obviously company. I think we\u2019ve -- basically our operating majors are pretty similar so we actually have been doing some analysis on that and I really can\u2019t point to one or two things that says this is the reason why.", "We just think -- it\u2019s not a huge difference, so they are actually closer than you think, so we are positive with the franchisees and slightly down with the company stores. So over time, we think that will balance out.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "And then just one last one on KFC, the increase of a half-a-point advertising from the franchisees, how does this now or how will this compare, I guess, as a percentage of sales to your other brands?", "David Novak", "It\u2019s primarily more of a shift from local to national, which gives us more rating point power through television. But our basic percent of sales in terms of the advertising are comparable.", "It\u2019s all very close. The big challenge when you are dealing with franchise networks is that when they give up part of their national dollars, they are giving up some of their local money. It\u2019s basically fixed by contract, and so the only time the franchisees will do that is when they are really excited about what the brands are working on and if they see that it will end up giving them more ultimate scale and presence in the marketplace with their media.", "We are very pleased to see the franchisees excited at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell about the plans that we have in place and the fact that they would give up some of their local media to support what they think are going to be better national calendars.", "I think that\u2019s the thing that drives all of this.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks very much.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Steven. Next question please, Jennifer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Two questions for you; one on the refranchising in the U.S. and I guess a second on the China \u201908 new unit openings, or ways that we can think about that. On the refranchising in the U.S., you are talking about 1500 units from early \u201906 to late \u201908, I think it is. I think to get to that number, you need over 800 units in the next five quarters or so. How should we think about the rough breakdown by quarter?", "And then, when you are thinking about the -- perhaps as we would think about modeling that, would that be roughly neutral to profit after we consider D&A and G&A reductions, with those refranchises? Or perhaps will that tend to be a little bit different now, begin a little bit more hurtful to profit as you get deeper into the refranchising?", "I guess the second one on China is how should we think about the new opens in China next year? Perhaps you could give us some color about the pace.", "Richard T. Carucci", "First, regarding the refranchising, David, we still believe we are on track for the three-year target that we\u2019ve laid out, so no changes there. Regarding the pace by quarter, really hard to judge. We can\u2019t predict it. It\u2019s hard to model it but to your point, not a huge impact on the long-term operating profit. As we mentioned earlier, it takes a little bit of time for the G&A to catch up to the reduction in units but that\u2019s now been going on for a while, so again, it\u2019s roughly neutral on an operating profit basis and the balance is not a lot a different than what\u2019s occurred so far.", "Regarding China and new units for \u201908, as we mentioned before, we feel good about this year. The pipeline is strong and again our normal, we are probably still sticking to our normal tune, David, which is at least 400 units for the China division.", "Tim Jerzyk", "We\u2019ll have more details on that, David, for our New York meeting.", "David Novak", "I think the main thing on the refranchising is, to summarize, is we are on target and we are focused on doing it right. We are going to put our stores in the right hands of the right operators so that we have the best long-term prospects as we go forward.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Do you anticipate a few hundred units, KFC units being closed because of this reimaging requirement by the middle of \u201908?", "Tim Jerzyk", "David, we had previously said somewhere in the range of potentially 100 to 300, and we still think that that is the case. But it is looking maybe a little bit optimistic. We could be better than that, at least better than the high end.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks very much.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, David. Next question please, Jennifer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Lehman Brothers.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much. A couple of questions, just first on the U.S. cost outlook. I know you commented on China. If you could give us an update on your commodity cost outlook for I guess the rest of \u201908 and your initial outlook -- I\u2019m sorry, the rest of \u201907 and your initial outlook for \u201908.", "And then just as a follow-up on that, where you currently stand in terms of the menu pricing in the U.S. I know you mentioned a menu price increase in your release. I\u2019m just wondering your comfort levels in terms of taking pricing while the traffic remains difficult to achieve.", "Tim Jerzyk", "In terms of commodities on \u201908 first, we\u2019ll give you an outlook on that just like we did last year at the New York meeting, a full view on that. We have our annual operating plan reviews coming up and we\u2019ll get a good review of that and then provide that information to you. I think it\u2019s December 12th in New York.", "As far as \u201907, we still anticipate -- we said coming into the year 2% to 3% U.S. inflation on commodities and we are still right in that range, at the high end of the range, which is what we said last time. That has not changed, so we still expect 3% inflation for the year. In terms of dollars, about $45 million.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Regarding the menu pricing, I mentioned in my comments that Pizza Hut basically has offset some of its inflation by reduced discounting, so they haven\u2019t really taken menu pricing but they have gone on the reduced discounting front. Regarding the other brands, our menu pricing has roughly offset most of the inflation.", "What we did, we sort of anticipated this could be an inflation year, what we did is we took some small increases at the beginning of the year and then another small increase about the middle of the year and together, those have largely offset the inflation, which was in part how we were able to keep the profits slightly positive in this environment.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Do you think then the pricing is at all having an impact on traffic? Do you do any studies to kind of see the balance of the two in the U.S.?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We look at it a lot but what we do know is that you just can\u2019t sit there and take the inflation, so we try to obviously offset the inflation first with productivity initiatives and then we take modest pricing, so what we try to do to be smart about it, to take it in small chunks versus big chunks and not take it on the most price sensitive items, so we do understand that in this category, we have to provide great value so we still focus in on that but we also take modest pricing to protect the P&L.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "And then just one follow-up on your long-term debt, obviously you guys have been talking about it for a while so we\u2019re glad to see the news. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about the thought process that went into I guess the determination of the appropriate leverage levels and whether the current credit market environment had any impact on the decision. You also mentioned the use of ongoing refranchising proceeds for the share repurchase. Just wondering if you can give your expectations on those process for perhaps \u201908.", "Richard T. Carucci", "I\u2019ll give a brief overview of the thinking and then I\u2019ll let Tim comment further. You know, this thing is just a balancing game. We try to come up with an overall financial balance that we think works for managing the company and works for our shareholders, and obviously we are fortunate that all of our businesses generate cash, including China, that we have a pleasant problem of figuring out what to do with the cash.", "Regarding the debt level, we are trying to balance keeping a strong balance sheet, which we are very committed to. At the same time, we also recognize that we love our stock right now and think we\u2019ve done a lot of share buy-backs historically. We\u2019ve taken 12% of the shares off the table in the last three years and we look at this as an opportunity to do even more of that going forward.", "So we just try to balance really all of the factors that are out there. I\u2019ll let Tim talk a little bit more about how we plan to go about getting that done.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Jeff, first of all, if you look at the credit markets, we definitely like the rates, where they are today and things are improving as time moves one. Second, we viewed our balance sheet was under leveraged from two perspectives. We believe we were not challenging it necessarily, our balance sheet, meaning it to be as efficient and effective as we do challenge our businesses every day. And we know we are a much stronger company, particularly even just versus a few years ago. And as David mentioned earlier, we were also targeting the sleep-at-night comfort level because we do want everyone to feel comfortable with a higher amount of leverage, after we worked very hard to get where we are today.", "But when you look at our company today, we have a global portfolio that is delivering very well. It provides a lot of diversification in terms of geography and brands. We have substantial, consistent and growing cash flow. That\u2019s a very powerful story, and we have a large and increasing franchise base in the U.S. business and in YRI that\u2019s pretty significant.", "And then on top of that, where we are investing cash, Yum! China is [self-funding], so the overall picture was a very good one we viewed in terms of increasing our leverage, and as I said, we wanted to task our balance sheet to be more efficient and deliver more to the overall enterprise value of the company.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jeff. Next question please, Jennifer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rachael Rothman with Merrill Lynch.", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys. Just to follow up to Jeff\u2019s question, if I could; should we assume that you will be using your revolve to do the repurchases, or is there any thought about floating bonds? And then, are there any covenants in your revolver that, based on different leverage levels, your interest rates either tick up or down? I haven\u2019t had a chance to pull the credit facility agreement.", "Tim Jerzyk", "We do have some provisions in our credit facility in terms of leverage levels but we are well below the levels that you would need to be concerned about.", "In terms of how we are going to do this, we do anticipate going to the bond market. We don\u2019t have any specific timing that we are going to provide. We are going to be opportunistic about it. We anticipate going sometime by the end of the year to the bond market.", "If you look at our debt profile in terms of the maturities, we have a bond due next year, early next year and then we have some in \u201911 and \u201912, 2011 and 2012, and 2016. We would like to extend that out. We think long-term rates are very good right now so we definitely would like to extend out the profile.", "Also, when we look at it, we would like to stretch it out and have alternating years where there is no debt due, so we kind of view that as somewhat of a natural hedge. We like the ability to be able to use the revolver, as you said, to pay off bonds in a given year if the credit markets aren\u2019t really good, so that we can sit on our cash and maybe go to the market the following year.", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. And then, can you just remind us in terms of in the U.S., your chicken contract, where you stand on that? Does that come up for renewal in December?", "And then on labor, could you talk a little bit about the opportunities to get margin leverage maybe next year, even though minimum wage will step up again? And the same question for China, just some comments around labor. A number of the other companies that we cover are seeing pretty strong labor increases in China.", "Tim Jerzyk", "In terms of our chicken in the U.S., we do contract most of our chicken in the U.S. across all three brands, and most of those contracts are in the process of being renegotiated, so we don\u2019t really have any information on what we\u2019ll be doing or experiencing the next year, but we\u2019ll provide, as I said, the full commodity outlook in our December meeting.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Regarding the labor question, Rachael, on both the U.S. and China, we do expect to continue to see some wage inflation in the U.S. over the next few years. As Tim said, we don\u2019t know what will happen on the commodity side yet but we\u2019re going to be prepared to deal with modest inflation on that side as well. So that\u2019s sort of our initial expectations but we\u2019ll share more at the December meeting.", "On China, China labor has actually been going up for us fairly steadily over the last several years and it continues to go up as the people get richer, quite frankly. So we just sort of see that as part of the costs of doing business in China. It has been there for the last five years and we expect that going forward.", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Rachael. Jennifer, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glen Petraglia with Citigroup.", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks. It\u2019s Petraglia. Most of my questions have been -- that happens all the time. Most of my questions have been answered but I was hoping you could give me an update on the Pizza Hut U.K. refranchising efforts, how many have been completed at this point and whether you still think you are on track to hit your targets.", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think so far, the answer is none have been completed so far, but having said that, we are still on our target of completing it over a three year period so again, we still feel good about our ability to do that. Obviously it helps as we are getting little better results the last quarter in the U.K., and that will keep us on track.", "So we\u2019ll keep working on it. We\u2019ll give you an update when we have more, Glen, and I can understand anyone who\u2019s last name has ever been mispronounced.", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks.", "David Novak", "I think again on this one, we believe we will deliver on our commitments in the U.K. We had a great third quarter. What we really want to do here again is get the right franchisees and make sure we have the right partners. There is no need for us to rush, so we are more on the John Wooden phrase of be quick, but don\u2019t hurry.", "The biggest thing we can do, I think, is get the business back where it really needs to be so we can command the best prices and get the best franchisees.", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Have you guys been holding off in terms of looking to refranchise these units until you fix it, or has it just been that you just haven\u2019t had the interest at this point?", "Richard T. Carucci", "No, we do have interest. We have packages out there and we have people bidding on those packages. We are obviously in the first few -- our experience when you do some of these, the first few you are going to make sure you establish a good price precedent, so to David\u2019s point, we are not going to hurry through to hit a numerical target. We are more looking at how do we get good proceeds and the right franchise partners over the three-year period.", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Glen. Jennifer, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with CIBC.", "John Glass - CIBC", "Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I missed this, but can you break out specifically the sources of cash for this $4 billion? In other words, have you articulated exactly how much debt you are willing to take on? Can you talk a little bit about the timing? Does the fact that you've authorized $1.25 billion over the next 12 months mean that most of the buybacks happen in '09, or is that just a formality?", " Tim Jerzyk", "First of all, on the timing of the $1.25 billion, as always we'll be opportunistic with it. We don't specify timing. I think the important thing there was the level of the authorization was substantially higher than in the past, so we take that as a sign that we intend to be pretty active; but we are going to buy it opportunistically, just as we have in the past. We'll report to you every quarter -- as we always do -- on the level of buyback that quarter.In terms of the $4 billion, we said it would be sourced from operating cash flow, refranchising and additional debt. We did not cite the incremental amount of debt.In terms of our overall structure in terms of additional leverage, when we looked at the strength of our company, we believe we can take our adjusted debt to EBITDA level up to as much as 3.0.", " John Glass - CIBC World Markets", "In this conversation, did you also talk about a dividend payout ratio, make any commitment to a higher payout ratio?", " Tim Jerzyk", " Well, we did just double our dividend with the second quarter payment and our annual payout ratio that we developed, in terms of policy on that, was 35% to 40%. So with that payment, we're now about in the middle of that range.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Jason West - Deutsche Bank.", " Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "I just wanted to get a little more color on the fourth quarter outlook. You guys are guiding 8% to 10% operating profit growth. I'm assuming the share count will be down fairly significantly; but you're saying that EPS will be down year over year. I'm wondering if there is something I am missing there. What do you think the tax rate will be? Or, are you incorporating some sort of debt offering there?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well the big impact as you said, Jason, is really the tax rate. Last year in the fourth quarter it was unusually low, a 17% tax rate, and we're assuming a more normal tax rate in the fourth quarter this year. Our full year guidance is in the 26% to 28% range and like I said, a normal tax rate, often a 17% tax rate, gets double-digit increase between operating profit and EPS. So that's really what's driving that difference.", " Tim Jerzyk", "As we said earlier and it's in the release I believe, our expectation for operating profit growth for Q4 is in the 8% to 10% range. We expect a very good quarter from an operating performance perspective.", " Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Can you talk about the CapEx outlook? Is that still 650 for this year and the foreseeable future, or do you expect any material move in that number?", " Tim Jerzyk", " We're still in that range. 650 might be plus or minus $25 million.", " Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "At Taco Bell, can you talk about the progression of traffic through the quarter? Did you see an improvement of traffic as the comps obviously got a little bit better, or was it more of a pricing-driven improvement relative to the first part of the year?", " Tim Jerzyk", "It's only been a few weeks in terms of the uplift that we've seen, but we expect to see significant traffic growth in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan", "It may be a little bit late for this question, but David Novak, I think I heard you mention that your franchise operations and company operations are testing about the same now from a customer perspective. Did you say that in one of your prepared remarks?", "David Novak", " The comment was, what was the difference between the Taco Bell performance with franchisee versus company. The Taco Bell franchisees are up. We're slightly down, so it's not a big, huge difference. The Taco Bell system is pretty much coming back in unison with a little bit more capability with the Taco Bell franchisees.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan", "So that was just a reference to sales. Let's talk about then from an operating perspective. Something that used to be a very big part of your business -- and presumably still is, it's not discussed as much \u2013 is your CHAMP scores and your different operation scores that are done at the store level.The point of the comment in question, KFC and Taco Bell have obviously underperformed in 2007 a lot of the traditional QSR chains quite a lot; and I guess for different reasons. Can you comment, especially as you move to more of a franchise model, if there's any type of operational changes in terms of how you can begin to raise the bar in terms of competing against some of your peers that might be doing a better job right now?", "David Novak", "Well, I haven't seen a tremendous amount of evidence that our peers are doing a hell of a lot better job than us, but I'll take your challenge at face value here.I think what we're continually working on and it is our number one strategy, is to run great restaurants. We focus on CHAMPS, the measure that we look at is 100% CHAMPS with a \u201cYes\u201d attitude. Basically what that says is that we deliver the basic customer expectations: cleanliness, hospitality, accuracy, maintenance, product quality and speed. We deliver all of that 100% to our standards. That's the measure.We basically have been improving that measure for the last five years, about one to two points a year, most of our brands. We have very little difference between the company and the franchise performance overall. I think that we're very focused on this basic expectation, because we know that our brands are extremely powerful and the better we operate, the better we're going to do.So it is a focus that we have. We invest very significantly in our operations in terms of making sure we put the resource up against the talent, the processes that you need to make steady improvement. It's also the most difficult part of our business to make dramatic improvement on. It's more of a slug it out type of thing.We try to refranchise to our best operators in terms of customer measures as well, John. That's big; we say, is this franchisee growth-ready? If their operational measures have slipped or if they're below standard in any way, we don't refranchise to those types of operators.I think as we have refranchised, I really feel like we're putting our stores in better hands, and I think that's the goal, to make sure that we're continually optimizing and getting the best possible group of operators that we can find.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia.", " Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia Securities", "Just two questions on brand initiatives in the U.S. First maybe an update on Taco Bell breakfast. Secondly, an update on WingStreet, particularly as it relates to progress with franchisees?", "David Novak", "I'll be happy to give you an update there. Let me just start by stepping back and laying out what we're really doing to turn around our U.S. business. The way we look at the U.S. business is that the best asset that we have going for us is the fact that we have 20,000 underleveraged assets. We basically do about half the volume -- or less than half of the volumes -- that McDonald's is doing in the United States. We're primarily single protein, single day-part driven, sometimes two day-part driven. We think we have a tremendous opportunity to get a lot more out of our existing asset base.", "Five years ago with McDonald's, everybody had the doom and gloom story for McDonald's. We take a lot of the heart out of the fact that they've taken that business and added close to $400,000 to $500,000 of sales out of their existing asset base.We are very focused on doing the same thing as well. Not the $400,000 but let's just try to cut that in half. We would be pretty happy, I think, five years from now if we could do that.", "I think there are two key factors that really give me a lot of confidence that we can succeed. First of all, our franchisees are very excited about the direction of our brands and they've committed to incremental media, as I talked about, on a national basis with both KFC and Pizza Hut.", "I think even more importantly, all of our franchise systems are very excited about the strong vision that we have to really focus very single-mindedly on developing new sales layers to really raise our restaurant volumes. Beverages and breakfast are two major opportunities that we have at Taco Bell, and I'll talk more about breakfast in just a second. At KFC, we're focused on the grilled platform, on-the-go, portable-type products for lunch and we don't have any deserts to speak of. At Pizza Hut, we're very focused on not only continuing to lead in pizza innovation but really leverage our WingStreet brand on a national, scalable basis and also bring other ways to leverage the home meal replacement category to bear.", "When we look at this, our franchisees are saying hey listen; we're not only going to innovate around pizza, we are clearly the leading innovator at what you do with all of the ingredients that we have at Taco Bell today around pizza and chicken. But I think what everybody is excited about is we're really focused on incremental, additional, meaningful sales layers as we go forward.Now one area, obviously, is breakfast at Taco Bell. We are absolutely convinced that Taco Bell will have a breakfast and we're very focused on it. It's going to take a long-term investment and long-term focus to get this done, because breakfast is a category that is probably the most deeply entrenched and the hardest behavior to really break into. But nevertheless, we think with the differentiated menu and approach that we're working on at Taco Bell, we can be successful.", "We went into, I think, four markets earlier in the year and got very good operational response to our breakfast products, but we also saw opportunities to do an even better job. So what we're doing right now is we are focusing our testing efforts in Omaha and we're working on some things that we think will even give us a much more innovative approach up against the breakfast occasion.Today, we really haven't put a lot of marketing behind it. Basically four weeks of television. We know that we're going to have to be much more aggressive as we go forward. But we've got a lot of learnings, we're moving in the next phase in Omaha and we're looking at some additional markets, one or two more markets, that we will take alternative approaches in to really make sure that we go up with against a differentiated breakfast.I can tell you that Greg Creed, the President of Taco Bell, and the team there, they know that this is a big opportunity. We know it's difficult, but we're very committed to making it happen and the products that we have are excellent, so we think we can definitely win.", "The other thing that you asked me about was WingStreet. WingStreet, we already have 1,000 WingStreets. This is a multi-brand that we created for Pizza Hut. We've created a WingStreet format for our traditional dine- in assets to complement what we're doing on the delivery business.A week or so ago, I met with a few of the most influential Pizza Hut franchise leaders, and they're very committed to work with us to help us scale this idea. We're working on lower cost options to put in the equipment package, but the goal is to ultimately get this into national distribution, and we're working on making that happen in the next couple years.That gives us a chicken platform at Pizza Hut that we never had and another point of difference. That is going to complement what we're doing on the value arena, which you will see news on next year that we're very happy about, and some other things I really can't talk about. I think that Scott Bergren and the team at Pizza Hut have done an excellent job crafting a new vision for incremental sales layers at Pizza Hut that has the Pizza Hut franchise very excited.", "I realize when you look at the U.S. business over the last five years, we've only averaged about 1% to 2% profit growth, 1% to 2% same-store sales growth, 1% to 2% cash flow growth. It's a very stable business, but it has not been a big part of our growth portfolio. We're really proud that we've made Taco Bell the second most profitable brand in the U.S. We're proud of the turnaround that we've had at KFC and how the franchisees are excited. I think Pizza Hut has been our big problem child. We've made a lot of progress in the last year there.We have a lot of wood to chop to get this up to the growth rate that we can feel good about, but I just want every investor to know that we're not sitting here clipping coupons in the U.S. business. We're holding ourselves very accountable to get this business moving and growing. Our target is to do at least 5% a year. We feel like we'll definitely make a lot more progress, obviously next year, even if it's because we're overlapping poor performance; but more importantly, we want to build a world-class business here in the U.S. to go along with the world-class business that we've done on our international business.", "When you look at international, ten years ago we had infrastructure; now we've got a global powerhouse. When you look at the U.S., we've done a nice job getting our brands back to a more stable, respectable base but we know we should be doing a lot better and we will. We're very committed to doing that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley.", "Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "I just want to dig in a little bit more on Taco Bell. Here is a brand where you have historically done very well with value and also menu innovation; those are two things that seem to be resonating for others in the QSR space right now.I'm just curious what you're hearing from consumers on what are their concerns? Are you still getting lingering concerns over the Ecoli incident or the rat video, or is there something else going on?", "David Novak", "I think that we have a little of that lingering in our research; it's still there. Frankly it's taken us longer to recover at Taco Bell than we envisioned. I think it's because the press was so dramatic and so pronounced and it came in a one-two punch; first with the Ecoli and then with the rodent issue.When you look at the Taco Bell brand measures though, you continue to look at a powerhouse. We're top tier in value, we have uniqueness in terms of our food, we are clearly the number one variety choice which really makes us the place you go to when you're thinking outside the bun. We have so much to build from.We're actually going to have net new unit growth at Taco Bell this year, so we're actually growing the brand in one of the most difficult years you could ever have, certainly from an attitudinal standpoint. So this brand is a great brand. I always say, it's the second most profitable brand in the United States. People don't even know that. We have great margins and we've got lots of leverage opportunities in breakfast, beverages, desserts. We're going after meaningful variety.The great thing that I feel good about is that we've got that value platform to build from. Clearly with gas prices the way they've been, the pressure on the customer, everybody else in the category is really competing down in that lower end so we do have more competition on the value side, but we're going to move forward through innovation and continuing to bring great value to the marketplace.I believe very strongly that Taco Bell will be back.", " Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley", "Is your weakness still regionally focused where those two incidents occurred?", "David Novak", "We still have a softness in the Northeast; we are obviously weaker in that area but we're bouncing back, slow but sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eli Lapp - Morgan Stanley.", " Eli Lapp - Morgan Stanley", "On the last call you guys were sort of deliberating about the merits of investment grade. Obviously you're erring on the side of conservative. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how fluid that internal debate is? Is it purely rate driven? I think you drive home the fact that your business could probably support perhaps even more leverage than you're putting on now. I just wonder if you could walk us through that deliberation.", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think it comes back to what I mentioned earlier, and that's just getting balance. Again, as I've mentioned before, we feel really good about our stock price. Tim mentioned that we thought the balance sheet could work harder. By the same token, we like having a strong balance sheet and being able to borrow without securitization and those types of constraints.We spent a lot of time thinking about it, and we're comfortable with this course of action. We plan on proceeding with this course of action and it would take something fairly major in the marketplace to shift on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Fischer - Bear Stearns.", " Joe Fischer - Bear Stearns", "I want to clarify; on the national ad spend increase at KFC and Pizza Hut, that's not incremental advertising dollars? That is just the shift from local to national in both cases?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes.", " Joe Fischer - Bear Stearns", "On China and the chicken cost, I was wondering, is there any opportunity or barrier to importing chicken into China? Have you thought about that?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, there are certain quotas by country that do limit import into China. Obviously we are working hard to get imports in, but we are subject to those quotas.", " Joe Fischer - Bear Stearns", "Can you tell us what the other three Taco Bell test markets are besides Omaha?", "David Novak", "We are only in Omaha right now.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from David Palmer - UBS.", " David Palmer - UBS", "Just a follow-up question on your international sales strength and the macro environment. It seems like international sales has really been the big upside of '07, if you had to isolate the big story. I'm wondering how you're thinking about consumer strength and how that's contributing to that, and how you might be thinking about economic factors being a positive or a negative for \u201808, and how you're perhaps budgeting and planning against the consumer, particularly internationally, in '08?", "David Novak", "I think we have a pretty robust global economy that everybody is reading about, so I think that clearly gives us some tailwind. Obviously that is some upside for us. I think the big thing that we look at is how in the hell do we excite our customers? When you look outside the United States, we know we only have one major global competitor and that's McDonald's.", "All of the things that we're working on right now, David, as we talk about turning around the U.S, if we develop a breakfast platform, if we develop a beverage platform, if we develop new desserts, all that stuff is going to explode into our international business faster than we can implement them here in the U.S. We've got innovation in all of those areas all around the globe.", "I think what we really think is with our international business, YRI, the same issues we have in terms of under-leveraged assets are there as well. We are focused on that from a global perspective. When Graham Allan wakes up, who runs our international business, we want him to do at least as well next year. We're not giving him any planning break because he happened to have a good year this year. He happened to have a good year two years ago. What we want to do is keep that same kind of performance going.Now, what we expect out of China is to grow around the 20% profit rate. What we expect out of international is to grow at least 10% and we want to get the U.S. to be at least 5%. Hopefully the U.S. will be a lot better next year, which we think it will be and we'll get more balance in terms of our overall portfolio. So we're going to continue to task the companies to perform like we have in the past.", " Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, David. Before we close out the call, there's a couple reminders for all of you. On Tuesday, October 30th we have Taco Bell Investor Day in Irvine. Call us at 888-298-6986 to register. We would be happy to have you out there.Wednesday, December 12th is our New York investor event from about 9:00 a.m. to noon on Wednesday December 12th. That's our annual update with investors. The meeting will take place at the New York Stock Exchange this year, it's a change in venue so please be aware of that. As always, registration in advance is required and you can complete that online at www.Yum.com. Please register before Monday, December 10th.Finally, our fourth quarter earnings release will be Monday, February 4 2008.", "David Novak", "Let me just wrap this up. I'll do this by telling you I look forward to seeing you in December where we can lay out our 2008 plans and talk about the future growth prospects that we have. We're very committed to continuing our track record of at least 10% EPS growth, because we've got China and YRI really demonstrating that they are sustainable growth engines. They had a great 2007 on top of a 2006. They're both opening up a record number of new units, which obviously bodes well for next year\u2019s profits, as well as the fact that the same-store sales growth is growing as well, which gives us more scale and more countries in more territories and more marketing clout.", "Our U.S. business we think is poised for stronger results in 2008. I realize that's one where it is \u201cshow us, don't tell us\u201d but the proof is going to be in the pudding there. We feel very confident that we can do much better in the U.S. next year.We are embarking on the most ambitious share buyback program that we've had yet. As I think Rick pointed out, we've taken off 11% of our shares in the last couple of years and we plan to take off in the next few years another 20% of our shares, so that's a very ambitious and good program for us.Finally, one of the big things we've been working on from day one is to build dynasty-like performance and be a company where you can deliver, and count on us to be consistent. This will be the sixth straight year where we've delivered and exceeded our at least 10% target; this year, up 13%. We're very bullish on our business, as I'm sure you can tell.", "One other point that I want to let you know is and you will probably be reading about is that next week we'll be launching the world's largest hunger relief awareness campaign. We're doing this on a global basis. We're tying in with the United Nations World Food Program where we will be raising money in our restaurants, building awareness through media and our in-store materials, and volunteering all around the world to try to help do what we can to help fight hunger. More people die from hunger than war, HIV and tuberculosis so there's a major issue that we as a company are trying to play a role in, in terms of corporate social responsibility.We're very proud of our results but as I've said before and I certainly say to everybody, that's yesterday's newspaper. We're focused on the future and the best is yet to come.", "Thank you very much.", "", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Luanne and good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on our call this morning. The call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of this recording.", "I would also like to advise that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s expectations based on currently available data. However, actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties. The information in this conference call related to projections or other forward-looking statements may be relied on subject to the Safe Harbor statement included in our earnings release last night and may continue to be used while this call remains in the active portion of the company\u2019s website, www.yum.com.", "On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO.

It will be a comprehensive update. Save the date. We\u2019ll look forward to you being here. ", "Now I would like to turn the call over to David Novak, our Chairman and CEO. ", "", "David Novak", "Thank you, Tim and good morning, everybody. With all the negative business headlines I\u2019ve been reading lately, I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am to be in a position to share some really good news, which is that Yum! Brands has continued to differentiate itself from other restaurant companies by delivering consistently strong results. Led by the strength of our global portfolio of category leading brands, we reported full-year EPS growth of 15% for 2007, up from our previous estimate of 13%, continuing to build on our track record of success. ", "This marks our sixth consecutive year of achieving double-digit EPS growth, meeting our shareholder commitment of at least 10%. ", "We also ended the year with significant core business momentum while making good investments for the long term. I am especially pleased with the outstanding positive momentum of our international and China business. ", "China delivered an exceptionally strong finish to the year with fourth quarter operating profit up 44% on a reported basis, despite well-publicized record high commodity inflation. This is a phenomenal result and speaks to the power of our superior brand positioning and execution in China. ", "Equally, our Yum! Restaurants International business, or YRI, continues to impress, achieving fourth quarter system sales growth of 9% on a constant currency basis. A key driver of this performance was record level development of 852 new restaurants in 2007 which, when combined with the opening of 506 new units in our China division last year, makes this the number one retail developer outside the United States. ", "Our global powerhouse status not only explains our strong results in 2007 but positions us well to drive consistent growth going forward. Importantly, while the U.S. was weak, we are also confident momentum is building. ", "All of this is leading to even more good news, which is that we are revising our previous 2008 earnings per share guidance upward to $1.85, reaffirming our annual commitment to deliver EPS growth of at least 10%. ", "Now 2008 will also be filled with major one-time benefits that are not included in our full year guidance. Rick will put the one-timers into perspective with his comments but for those of you who can\u2019t wait, the $1.85 does not include an estimated $0.06 of one-timers which takes us to $1.91 of reported EPS. ", "We know the importance of consistency when it comes to investment performance so we have constructed our business model to deliver this level of consistency year after year. We believe we can continue to build on our track record of success, given the strength of our global brands and the breadth of our global presence. ", "And with our ability to use the significant operating cash we generate around the world to fund high return investments, we are even more confident in our ability to grow shareholder value. ", "As I talk about each of our businesses, I\u2019d like to do so in the context of our four key growth strategies -- number one, build leading brands in China in every significant category; next, drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere; third, dramatically improve U.S. brand positions, consistency, and returns -- and believe me, we are very convicted to do that; and four, drive industry-leading, long-term shareholder and franchisee value. ", "So I\u2019ll start with China, where we are well on our way to building leading brands in every significant category. 2007 was an exceptionally good year for us in China and we expect another outstanding year in this important growth market, driven by our continued rapid development of multiple brands in Mainland China. ", "Currently, we are in 450 cities in Mainland China with KFC and we are in over 80 cities with Pizza Hut casual dining and expanding into several new cities with broader development of Pizza Hut home service. Additionally, encouraged by the results of our East Dawning TV test last year, we are expanding this new concept further, going from 12 units today to more than 20 by the end of 2008, including restaurants in Beijing in time for the summer Olympics. ", "In terms of development in Mainland China, our brands have an enormous first mover advantage and we do not expect that picture to change for the foreseeable future. Our huge lead is unlike anywhere else in the world, which is particularly important in a market of 1.3 billion people, expanding personal incomes, and an economy growing in the low double-digits. ", "A couple of interesting facts about this growth market -- first, recent government studies suggest that the middle class in Mainland China now numbers over 250 million people, which is equivalent to what the entire U.S. population was in 1990, at which point the U.S. QSR category was already very well-established. ", "Second, China\u2019s Ministry of Information Industry reported last week that at the end of December of 2007, there were 547 million cell-phone subscribers in Mainland China, or roughly 40% of the population. This speaks to how rapidly the country is developing as Chinese consumers embrace new technology and new concepts. These numbers are absolutely astounding and give us reason to believe that the demand for our brands will continue to grow at a significant pace. ", "For KFC, we expect to again add over 300 new restaurants in Mainland China in 2008, which will continue to widen our lead over any competitor. Today we have a lead of more than 1,000 units versus our nearest competitor and we are out-developing them by roughly three-to-one. ", "Our brand majors and returns remain very strong and we expect KFC to continue to strengthen its QSR leadership position in 2008 through the development of new proteins and new beverages and the expansion of our breakfast day part. ", "Our leadership position remains and continues to build for Pizza Hut casual dining. Now with over 350 restaurants and growing rapidly, we are the undisputed leader in Mainland China in this category. We expect to open about 85 new casual dining Pizza Huts in 2008, while at the same time expanding our tea time offering and innovating our menu with a range of new and exciting products. ", "Our Pizza Hut home service business continues to perform well, so we will further expand this concept to more cities to build the scale. By year-end, we expect to add about 20 new Pizza Hut home service units, bringing our total to about 75. Chinese consumers are embracing the convenience and value of home-delivered food and we expect to ride this trend as it gains even more momentum. ", "You can see we remain very focused against our number one strategy of building leading brands in China in every significant category. We have a huge strategic advantage with our stable and experienced management team in Shanghai, our established and state-of-the-art distribution system, our dedicated manufacturing capabilities, and our large scale development team, all of which combine to produce results that are unmatched by anyone in Mainland China and this category is still on the ground floor. ", "As further evidence of our leadership position in this market, just last week Yum! China was voted by CCTV, China\u2019s leading media company, as one of the top 10 best companies in China and the only restaurant company to receive this unique distinction. ", "This only serves to strengthen our ability to attract and retain the very best talent to grow this very large business. As I\u2019ve said before, we believe that with our China business, we are in the first inning of a nine-inning game, so we have a very long runway for growth in this very important market. ", "As a result, we continue to expect our China division will be our lead growth business, delivering 20% growth in annual operating profit. ", "Now on to YRI, where you\u2019ll see from our results that we are driving aggressive international expansion and building strong brands everywhere, our number two strategy. As I noted earlier, YRI had another really good year in 2007 with reported operating profit growth of 18%, driven by 15% growth in system sales. This is one of the best years YRI has ever had and after several consecutive years of significant growth, YRI is now one of the world\u2019s most profitable restaurant companies as a standalone entity, with operating profit of nearly $500 million. And having ended 2007 on a strong note, YRI has entered 2008 with solid momentum. ", "The key driver underlying YRI\u2019s profit growth is that the worldwide development capability of our 700-plus franchisees, enabling us to be the leading player in QSR chicken with KFC and casual dining with Pizza Hut. We opened a record 852 new restaurants last year, the eighth consecutive year we have opened at least 700 new units and a new record for YRI. Ninety-four percent of these units were developed by our franchisees, so the returns in this business are without equal. ", "Importantly, we have plenty of room left to grow both KFC and Pizza Hut in the markets where we operate, as well as markets that we are only beginning to penetrate. For example, we are accelerating our unit growth in India while continuing to develop aggressively in Russia, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. ", "This really highlights the fact that our franchisees are realizing solid unit economics in their new restaurants, both KFC and Pizza Hut. Additionally, our existing franchise business is very healthy in YRI, with 5% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter. This performance is especially remarkable given the pace of our new unit development and, like China, speaks to our strong competitive positioning worldwide. ", "The key to this growth is that the YRI team has very effectively leveraged their global product development capability. As great new ideas are generated in various markets around the world, they are quickly adapted in other markets. Great examples of this best practice sharing includes box meals and the Wrapstar in KFC and Cheesy Bites in Pizza Hut. ", "Just last week, Graham Allan and Micky Pant, our President and Chief Marketing Officer respectively of YRI, they took me through their initiatives to develop permanent sales layers and new concepts around the world, from developing a new range of beverages in Australia to testing the KFC breakfast offerings in the U.K. and Singapore, to validating Taco Bell International in Mexico. The team has dedicated significant resources to building future growth platforms for an already rapidly growing business, seeding and shaping ideas that can be replicated around the world. ", "Finally, YRI\u2019s new unit pipeline remains strong. Aggressive development of our KFC and Pizza Hut brands will continue in many markets of the world and for the longer term, you should expect us to continue to build big businesses in India, Russia, and Continental Europe. ", "To summarize, we are very confident YRI will have another great year in 2008, with at least 5% growth in system sales on a local currency basis and 10% operating profit. Like we said in New York, we view YRI as a high-growth business, having the greatest potential of divisions, given the size of the worldwide market that we have yet to penetrate. So stay tuned for more great news from YRI. ", "Clearly our challenge in 2007 was our U.S. business. While fourth quarter same-store sales increased by 1%, operating profit was down 1%. In all candor, the best thing I can say about our weak U.S. performance in 2007 is that it sets us up for growth in 2008 and we can\u2019t wait to get into 2008. I guess we\u2019re already in it but we are glad we are here. ", "This is especially true when you consider that last year\u2019s results were primarily impacted by two isolated and now distant incidents that affected our largest and most profitable U.S. brand, Taco Bell. Meanwhile, Pizza Hut made significant progress and KFC basically stood still. ", "As I outlined earlier, our number three growth strategy is to improve U.S. brand positions, consistency, and returns, and as I shared in New York, our disappointed U.S. results in 2007 have strengthened our resolve to take the bold steps that are necessary to bring this growth strategy to life. ", "Learning from our experience and building a strong and growing business in China, and from studying the successes of our U.S. competitors, we are now implementing five key strategic initiatives to turn around our U.S. business. Number one, providing more balanced menu options; number two, moving in to multiple day parts; number three, offering multiple proteins and product layers, including aggressively pursuing beverages; number four, everyday value menus; and number five, continually contemporizing our assets. ", "These initiatives will take shape over the course of 2008 and begin to yield meaningful results in 2009. That said, given the weak results we\u2019ll be lapping from 2007, coupled with the stronger marketing calendar and better overall execution this year, we are confident that we can achieve 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and 5% operating growth in our U.S. businesses in 2008. ", "I\u2019ll now talk about each of our three key U.S. brands. As you know, Taco Bell is the second-most profitable QSR brand in the U.S., with a 70% share of the Mexican category, and is perhaps the most charismatic QSR brand appealing to young Americans. ", "Our long-term goal is to make Taco Bell a true restaurant mega-brand, leveraging our unique, Mexican-inspired positioning. The good news is that we are building a strong momentum from 2007 to propel us on this journey. Over the course of last year, we experienced a gradual improvement in Taco Bell sales and achieved same-store sales growth of 2% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating that we are starting to turn the corner with this great brand. ", "We started 2008 promoting one of our customers\u2019 all-time favorite products, Cheesy Gordita Crunch, underpinned by a secondary message promoting our $0.99 Cheesy Bean and Rice Burrito, giving us a strong start to the year. ", "We followed this with yesterday\u2019s launch of Fiesta Platters, which was featured in Super Bowl advertising over the weekend. This new product is a complete real meal solution that packages together all the favorite dishes of a sit-down Mexican meal in a convenient and portable plate. Great for lunch and dinner, all at a strong value price relative to comparable meals at sit-down restaurants. ", "As we are pairing this launch with a secondary message promoting our $0.99 Gordita Supreme, we are now offering value at the high end versus casual dining at dinner, along with value at the low end versus fast food, a powerful combination. ", "We consider our multi-layer marketing approach to be a breakthrough strategy for Taco Bell that will help drive much-improved performance in 2008. And there is even more exciting product news on the horizon for Taco Bell as we introduce our new signature beverage line this summer, Frutista Freeze, and prepare for the launch of other breakthrough products later this year. ", "You will also see us build greater awareness of our great taste, less fat, fresco line of products through a combination of print and online advertising and in the spring, we plan to invigorate our already leading value positioning with a compelling why pay more menu that builds on the success of our Think Outside the Bun advertising campaign. ", "Finally, we are also continuing to develop our breakfast offerings with the full intention of eventually entering and winning in the breakfast segment. In fact, our future vision for Taco Bell is ultimately 24-hour operations. Obviously we\u2019ve got a long way to go and a lot of work to do to make this happen, but I want you to know something -- we are striving to get it done and we are going to make it happen. ", "So as you can see, we are regaining our edge at Taco Bell and expect this brand to achieve very good results in 2008 as we build a platform to support even stronger growth ahead. ", "To update you on Pizza Hut, as I outlined in New York, we are on the verge of a major reinvention of the brand and delivery category as we drive the aggressive rollout of three new permanent sales layers at Pizza Hut -- pasta and Wing Street Chicken and everyday pizza value, alongside our category leading pizza innovation. ", "Just last month, we introduced Pizza Mia, a value oriented product that we will promote year-round, all day, every day, currently priced at three for $15. Initial sales of this product have been strong, supported by a compelling value message and heavier national television weights, which you\u2019ll recall from our presentation in New York includes an additional three quarters of a percentage point approved by our franchisees late last year because they are so bullish about our marketing plan. ", "And we will continue to be the pizza innovator. As evidence of this, I encourage you to try our new crunchy cheesy crust pizza, which was launched just this month. Even more exciting is the launch of Tuscany pastas in April. This represents a first for the quick service restaurant business, with home delivery of restaurant quality, great-tasting hot pastas, all at a great value for families looking for an alternative yet affordable break from weekday kitchen duty. ", "Additionally, we are beginning to gain significant momentum with the rollout of Wing Street conversions. We\u2019ve reached an agreement with our franchisees to dramatically expand Wing Street into our existing Pizza Huts and by the end of 2009, we\u2019ll be in position to advertise America\u2019s largest wing chain on national television. ", "Given the competitiveness of the Pizza category, I cannot provide anymore specific information on the balance of the year marketing activities, but I can tell you that we are confident about our ability to grow our Pizza Hut brand in the U.S. by developing layers of sales, not limited time only topping offers. And in particular, what we are doing to transform Pizza Hut into a home meal replacement business. ", "At KFC, results for 2007 fell short of expectations and underscored the need for dramatic change. As we talked about in New York, we are working with our franchisees with the goal of offering a new range of grilled and portable products any way you want it alongside our traditional delicious fried chicken. In addition, we plan to give the business a more youthful and contemporary image as we launch a new advertising campaign later this month. ", "We entered 2008 with our sauce-less yet spicy hot wings product at an attractive price point of $2.99, capitalizing on the end of the football season and providing a good start to the year. This marketing window benefited not only from a strong product offer but from an improved advertisement as well, plus an incremental half percentage point spread stint on national television as voted in by our franchisees last year. ", "Building on this momentum, we will introduce later this month a great tasting, value-priced toasted wrap and we will follow this up with the introduction of another grill pressed portable product later in the year to solidify our position at lunch. ", "Looking longer term, we are excited about the launch of our non-fried chicken platform and we are making good progress with our franchise partners to prepare for the rollout in the first half of 2009. This platform will form the centerpiece of our overall brand transformation in KFC, giving us the flexibility to sell a delicious range of products any way you want it. ", "Work is also continuing on our value-oriented products as well as a range of signature beverages to strengthen KFC as a destination brand. ", "Now on the development side in the U.S., we continue to expect new unit growth to ramp up at Taco Bell, achieving 2% net new unit growth in 2008. Additionally, we expect our Taco Bell re-image activity to gain greater momentum as our franchisees have embraced a new step to bold initiative that will accelerate the rollout of our contemporary bold choice restaurant design, which has been very well-received by our customers. ", "We are also making good progress with asset re-images at KFC and Pizza Hut. On the KFC side, contractually mandated asset upgrades will be completed for virtually the entire system by the end of 2008 and with Pizza Hut, our Wing Street conversion program, which I mentioned earlier, will help drive asset improvements at our restaurants. ", "Lastly, we expect to continue to generate a lot of cash in the U.S. this year and with continued refranchise activity, our U.S. EBITDA after capital expenditures should grow in 2008. ", "To summarize the U.S. business, we expect to meet our full-year targets for growth in sales and operating profit, supported by bold new brand initiatives as well as a relatively weak lap from 2007. While the performance of our U.S. business has been below expectations in the past, we have adopted breakthrough strategies to turn the business around with urgency. ", "I have seen the analyst reports that reflect a lot of skepticism about our ability to accomplish this transformation in the U.S. and I have sent them out to everybody in the U.S. And I understand that many will not believe it until they see it. That said, I invite you to attend our investor conference in Louisville in May where you will see and hear and taste tangible evidence of how we plan to leverage our U.S. assets. ", "As I said in New York, our U.S. business is an outstanding value investment with tremendous asset leverage and we are committed to unlocking this value over the next two to three years, and our U.S. teams have a lot of pride. There\u2019s a lot of pressure out there. They are putting it on themselves and we want to deliver. ", "Our fourth and final growth strategy is to drive industry-leading long-term shareholder and franchisee value. The good news is that we are already a leader in return on invested capital, not only among restaurant companies but among large cap, global retailers and consumer packaged good companies as well. So we are starting from a position of real strength. ", "The fact is that Yum! Brands is an incredible cash machine, with each of our divisions generating free cash flow or effectively funding their own capital investments. As this capital is deployed to high return opportunities, for example, new restaurants in China where the cash payback is only two years, we expect our returns to remain strong. These returns will further improve as we continue to refranchise restaurants, which will increase our franchise fees, currently amounting to $1.3 billion, with no capital investment, which makes those kind of returns unbeatable. ", "We\u2019re proud of the fact that we are one of the few companies that can make significant capital investments year after year and make great investments in large scale share buy-backs and pay a meaningful dividend and grow EPS consistently in the double digits. ", "Our commitment is to continue this tradition of rewarding our shareholders with superior returns. For more on our financial performance and outlook, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Rick Carucci, our CFO. Rick. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. In this section of our call, I\u2019m going to comment on four items -- 2007 full year results, 2007 fourth quarter results, our U.S. refranchising program, and 2008 guidance. ", "However, before I do that, I would like to address some questions that surfaced yesterday -- sorry, that surfaced following yesterday\u2019s earnings release. On the surface, our fourth quarter reported numbers understate the underlying strength of our business. Although operating profit increased only 1% and net income was essentially flat to prior year, our revenues increased 8%. ", "Furthermore, operating profit was reduced by unusually high G&A on the quarter, driven by incremental investments in growth projects, charges associated with certain restructurings, higher-than-expected incentive compensation partially offset by unexpected insurance recovery related income. All of these items combined to reduce our year-over-year operating profit growth percentage by eight points, reduce our net income growth percentage by nine points. ", "Said differently, in the absence of these charges, both our operating profit and our net income would have grown 9%, which are numbers consistent with our strong track record of performance. ", "With that said, I would like to turn our focus to the four topics I outlined earlier. Starting with our full year results, I would like to highlight three foundations of Yum!'s financial story -- our consistency of results, our global reach, and our strong cash generation. ", "First, for the sixth straight year, we met our commitment to deliver EPS growth of at least 10%, delivering 15% growth in 2007. We take our commitments to shareholders very seriously and consistency of performance is a top priority. ", "Second, we continue to expand our business around the world, opening a record 471 new units in Mainland China and a record 852 units in YRI. This broad-based unit expansion is central to our ability to meet our profit targets of at least 20% growth in China and at least 10% growth for YRI. We consider our global development engine to be a key competitive advantage. Clearly we are pleased with these development results in 2007 and our outlook for 2008 is also strong. ", "And third, we returned a record $1.7 billion to our shareholders last year -- share repurchases of $1.4 billion and dividends of almost $300 million. Over the last two years, we repurchased nearly $2.5 billion of our stock at an average price of $29.31, which we believe has created significant value for our shareholders. ", "Over the next two years, we expect to repurchase about $4 billion of stock, further reducing our share count by approximately 20%. ", "With respect to our fourth quarter results, I would like to briefly comment on our key businesses. First, I am also very excited about our China performance, which is phenomenal by almost any measure. Perhaps the most impressive result though is bottom line growth of 44%, lapping 36% growth from the year before. There are very few businesses anywhere that can drive same-store sales growth of 17% while developing new units at a record pace, and there are probably fewer businesses that could absorb roughly 35% inflation in the cost of their number one commodity -- in China\u2019s case, chicken -- and yet experience less than a half point of margin dilution. The fourth quarter results again demonstrate how very special our China business is. ", "YRI delivered fourth quarter results in line with expectations. Importantly, this was another high quality quarter, largely driven by system sales growth of 9% pre for-ex. This system sales growth was underpinned by continued strong unit development and 5% same-store sales growth. ", "Also, as noted in our release, YRI\u2019s 11% growth in reported operating profit was achieved after accounting for incremental investments and KFC sales growth initiatives, higher incentive compensation, and selected market level organizational restructuring. These items amounted to five points of profit growth. ", "All together we were very pleased with YRI\u2019s fourth quarter performance. By the way, as David mentioned, YRI now generates nearly $0.5 billion of annual operating profit. ", "U.S. results were below our expectations, as David noted. Fundamentally, fourth quarter same-store sales growth of 1% was insufficient to offset rising commodity costs, resulting in a 1% decline in U.S. operating profit. That said, profits held up pretty well for the fourth quarter and for the full year 2007, when you consider the weak sales at Taco Bell, our overall same-store sales softness, and higher-than-normal cost inflation. This reflects our disciplined cost management and is the result of much hard work by Yum!'s domestic teams throughout the year. ", "As David indicated, we anticipate better performance in the U.S. for 2008 and remain confident in this outlook today. ", "On the non-operating side, our tax rate was much better than we had expected in the fourth quarter, yielding a full year rate of 23.7%. Higher foreign tax credits were the key driver of this upside to our forecast. While we are happy with these results, as we previously mentioned we do expect our tax rate to trend upward over time. For 2008, our tax rate is expected to be between 28% and 30%. ", "Before I transition to an update on refranchising, I want to comment on one other aspect of our financial performance in 2007, capital spending. In December, we indicated that our capital expenditures for 2007 would be approximately $700 million. We actually spent closer to $740 million, but the good news is that the extra capital largely went towards higher return on investments for new restaurants in China. In December alone, we opened over 90 new units in China. That\u2019s an amazing three new restaurants per day. ", "Now for a brief update on U.S. refranchising. At the end of 2007, our U.S. company ownership stood at 22% of the entire system. As we announced in December, we intend to reduce this ownership to potentially reach below 10% by the end of 2010. Due to a number of factors, including market conditions, it is extremely difficult to predict the exact timing of this refranchising activity. ", "We remain confident we will achieve our U.S. refranchising goal over a three-year period and we will do it the right way for our brands, our operators, our franchisees, and our customers. ", "Over the next three years, you should expect to see continued proceeds from refranchising, positive benefits to U.S. restaurant margin, operating margin, and Yum! ROIC, and less demand on capital expenditures from the U.S. business. ", "In my update on 2008 guidance, I\u2019ll speak to the one-time earnings impact we expect to see this year. ", "With 2007 in the books, let\u2019s quickly cover our 2008 outlook. First of all, our growth model remains unchanged from what we presented in New York, which includes 20% operating profit growth from our China division, 10% operating profit growth from YRI, and 5% operating growth from our U.S. business. This adds up to be between 9% and 10% growth in operating profit. Combine this with a higher tax rate, higher interest expense, but expected share reductions, we are confident in our ability to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% in 2008, or $1.85 per share. ", "For 2008 earnings, there are two important twists that I want to point out. First, as we discussed in New York, given the loss of a roughly $30 million VAT benefit in Mexico this year, YRI\u2019s 10% earnings growth target will be more challenging to achieve than in past years. Fortunately, we expect foreign exchange upsides will continue to provide some measure of protection to YRI profits, so we remain confident that YRI will again achieve its 10% profit growth target. ", "Second, we will realize significant one-time net gains in 2008, which are very important to understand in order to properly evaluate the underlying performance of our business. As outlined in our release, in quarter one alone we\u2019ll benefit from roughly $60 million of one-time net upsides, including a gain from the sale of our minority interest in KFC Japan, restructuring charges to drive stronger U.S. brand growth, and expected refranchising losses. ", "On a full year basis, we expect a net positive impact from these quarter one items and future U.S. refranchising and brand investments. We are currently estimating the full year impact to be about $50 million in pretax profit, or about $0.06 of full year EPS. This is not included in the $1.85 ongoing full year EPS target I mentioned earlier. Let me repeat that -- the estimated $50 million of one-time positive impact is not included in the $1.85 full year EPS target. Therefore, combining the baseline EPS of $1.85 with projected one-time benefits of $0.06, we are currently guiding to full-year reported EPS of $1.91 for 2008. ", "We will update you on total and one-time EPS figures in future earnings releases, but I want to stress the importance of understanding baseline EPS as we go forward. Also, please understand that there could be considerable volatility during 2008 of these one-time benefits from our U.S. refranchising and brand transformation. ", "To wrap up, we expect another successful financial year for our shareholders, generating consistent financial performance, impressive global growth, and strong cash flow. ", "Back to you, David. ", "David Novak", "Thank you very much, Rick. And so I think you can all see that 2007 was in total another very strong year for Yum! Brands. We are truly in a unique position as a restaurant and retail company to be able to turn in such good results in a challenging environment, and with the [inaudible] of China and the stability of YRI\u2019s growing franchise fees, we are able to weather difficult storms. We\u2019ve done it in the past and we can do it in the future. ", "The U.S. is clearly our most competitive market yet our poor performance in 2007 is basically -- we look at it as a mixed blessing, as we get to overlap those results in 2008. This, along with a significantly stronger stable of sales building initiatives to drive growth across all our brands gives us confidence that we will achieve our profit goals in the U.S. ", "With all that said, you can expect 2008 that Yum! Brands will once again differentiate itself as not your ordinary restaurant company. So with that, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions and we look forward to talking to you all. Thanks for being on the call. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Congratulations on another good year, especially in international. I first wanted to ask a question about East Dawning. I have a feeling you want to talk more about this in your fall meeting out there, but I was wondering if you could give us a sneak peek. Can you give us any details on the returns on East Dawning? How are the new East Dawnings comparing to maybe KFCs in terms of sales volume and margins, and that\u2019s versus the new KFCs. Assuming there is lower volume, maybe you can give us a rough sketch of how close it is and maybe some of the changes you\u2019ve made that may be making the return on investment more appealing for this concept. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Let me talk first about the economics and then I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the concept, and David may want to add to that. It\u2019s really too early for us to get into projected returns, et cetera. We\u2019re still working on fine-tuning the economic model. ", "From a sales perspective, the sales actually in peak periods of lunch and dinner are actually very comparable to KFC figures. What we\u2019ve been working on especially hard the last year is getting the sales up at some of the snack time periods, the later afternoon, later evening day parts. And with the recent advertising we did, we actually did see a spike in sales there, so we are very encouraged by the recent sales increase that we\u2019ve got, which obviously bring us closer to the economics that we need. ", "In terms of changing the concept, we have changed the cooking platform over time. When we first started it, it was heavily commissary and then our second version to increase the appeal to the customers, we went with almost exclusively in-store prepared, and now this third version, we actually have a blend of both commissary and in-store prepared, so we think we are getting closer to getting the right cooking platform, which obviously will help the economics. ", "David, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to add on the concept. ", "David Novak", "No, I just think the team is very confident. We\u2019re very comfortable making a continual progress on this. We see this as a big idea. We are going and improving at the same time, so we are moving from 12 restaurants to 20 restaurants, which I think is a good sign that we think we can ultimately get there. And this is very consistent with our strategy to build leading brands in every significant category. Obviously Chinese food is the number one category in China, just like the hamburger has been traditionally in the United States and we\u2019re embarking on really creating the first Chinese fast-food restaurant chain there. ", "So very excited about it, the team is very targeted on what needs to be done, which as Rick said is to expand the use of the facility more throughout the day with the snacking occasion. If you go over there for the Olympics, we will have East Dawning in Beijing. You can give it a try there but I think you\u2019ll find that the food is excellent. And what we are really bringing there with East Dawning is excellent food, affordable pricing, and facilities that are consistent with the KFC asset base, which is a major advantage in that category. ", "So you know, it\u2019s early days. Lots and lots of optimism. We expect this to really pay off for us on a long-term basis. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Jeffrey Bernstein, Lehman Brothers.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. Actually, a couple of questions further on China, one kind of more specifically -- the restaurant margins were impressive. It seems like there was only a modest decline. I think your guidance was for 200 basis points. It looks like you got some significant leverage on the food costs. I\u2019m just wondering if you can perhaps put out details on the outlook for the first half in terms of pressure on costs, moderation, specifically related to I guess contracts for the commodities and perhaps pricing, and then I had a follow-up on China. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Regarding the commodities throughout the year, we really just know the first quarter costs will be a bit below what we had in the fourth quarter this year and we are in the process of finalizing negotiations for the quarter after that, so we\u2019ll have a better handle for it after we complete those negotiations. ", "We do expect, since we had a large increase in the back half of the year, we obviously expect food inflation on the first half of the year and negative inflation the second half of the year when we start lapping the very high chicken costs. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "And the pricing in that market, should that provide more of a margin lift in the back half then, or -- ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, we haven\u2019t taken pricing yet in \u201908. Again, as a reminder, we took modest price increase the beginning of \u201907 and then we took a larger price increase in the middle of \u201907, so we feel pretty good about our pricing. Obviously you have to judge that on the context of what happens and what we think will happen regarding the chicken commodities in the back half of the year, but we feel pretty good about it. ", "The other thing that the team has done a good job of, this is from a consumer standpoint great but also great from an economic standpoint, is we were very successful with the fish introduction of products in the back half of 2007, so we are actually running fish at a higher percentage of the menu than we thought we would be at this point and we are pleased with that and that helps us a little bit on the cost side. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and then just one follow-up question, kind of more broader; obviously you guys are very excited about China and the results justify that. I\u2019m just wondering perhaps if there are potential inhibitors to faster growth. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s capital -- perhaps human resources or site selection, but obviously the results are tremendous and growing at the same time as delivering very strong comps. I\u2019m wondering why we wouldn\u2019t see a further acceleration on the unit growth. ", "David Novak", "I think in December we opened almost three a day, so we are moving very aggressively in China. I think the big thing we want to do in China is we build a world-class business and we ensure that we have world-class operating teams, great sites, and that\u2019s really what we are focused on, making sure that we do so that over time, the business is as great as it can be. ", "We never want to get ahead of our people capability. We have tremendous people capability. We never want to get ahead of our site selection. We\u2019ve got the largest retail development team in the world, so we\u2019ve got all the resources to keep growing at the kind of pace that we are growing. We\u2019re just going to -- there\u2019s no need to grow any faster, from our perspective. ", "We want to grow right and I think where the big development gains will come will be through the expansion of Pizza Hut home service, which is basically an embryonic concept at this stage, and with the development of East Dawning. I think both of those concepts will give us some opportunity to have a step change in terms of our development but again, both of those concepts are more in their embryonic stages. So we\u2019re just going to keep growing at a steady pace.", "I think the most exciting thing for me on China and what we are seeing is driving so much of our growth is the one little fact that I mentioned to you earlier, that the Chinese Ministry report -- 540 million cell phone subscribers in China. Now that\u2019s -- what we\u2019re seeing is a lot of youthful kids now who can afford our food. Not everybody can afford our food every day but just think about if you have 550 million cell phone subscribers, I\u2019ll bet you those people can afford us at least once a year, and that\u2019s only going to get better as we go forward. ", "So this is a very exciting time for us. We\u2019ve got a great business. We want to protect it and grow it in an absolute, high quality fashion. So that\u2019s our goal. We\u2019ve got plenty of earning upside in our company or earnings capability to deliver at least 10% every year and we are not going to try to be a hero one year. We want to keep having lots and lots of good years. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "And David covered these numbers in his speech but I think they may be worth repeating in a competitive context. KFC, we ended up adding net units above 300 for the year, right? So our lead versus competition there is really expanding and continues to expand. Amazing numbers -- Pizza Hut casual dining added almost 100 units off a base of 250 last year. That\u2019s a staggering number. It\u2019s in the release but that\u2019s a 38% increase there and there\u2019s really nobody in western casual dining. And in the emerging categories of home service and East Dawning, we are making inroads. So I feel good not just about the absolute numbers but how it positions us from a competitive standpoint. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Glen Petraglia, Citigroup.", "Glen Petraglia - Citigroup", "Thanks. Good morning. David, I was hoping you could comment on specifically Taco Bell. Back in I think it was October at the Taco Bell investor day in California, some data was shared about consumer survey work and how consumers have seemingly remembered or are increasingly forgetting about the issues of about a year ago. I\u2019m curious to know if you feel that you are fully beyond that now or is that still impacting your business to a degree?", "David Novak", "Well, I think we definitely have turned a corner. We did have same-store sales growth last year off of very weak numbers in the fourth quarter. We feel like we are off to a very good start this year and so we are basically running the business today as if it\u2019s behind us. And we anticipate a very good year at Taco Bell, because -- you know, if for nothing else, the fact that we\u2019re just overlapping the performance last year.

We\u2019re building off what we think has to be one of the strongest advertising campaigns that positions us as the sandwich alternative with Think Outside the Bun. ", "We\u2019ve got a great line of product innovation. We\u2019re going to being building awareness of the Fresco, which is a great taste, no sacrifice line of products which we think allows us to potentially really go after the people that want to add more balanced options in a much more aggressive way. We\u2019ve reframed our value menu to really dramatize what makes it really special by going back and capturing some of our historical equities, which you\u2019ll see by mid-year under the Why Pay More? We\u2019re launching a Frutista Freeze line of beverages which was tested and proven enough to the point that the franchisees have made the equipment investment, and we think that gives us a platform to go after a big booming category that Sonic has frankly dominated without a whole lot of competition. And that\u2019s our user base right there that we think we can tap into. ", "And we\u2019ve got some very -- I would say very interesting ways to segment our business with different proteins. We are testing breakfast and looking at how to get after that and even with the line of the Fiesta platters, that gets us -- you know, that\u2019s a high quality meal, a great value that is I think positioned well up against casual dining at times like this. So we are going up against the high end and the low end. ", "So we think we\u2019ve got a heck of a good plan for Taco Bell and the good news is the unfortunate incidents are very distant now and behind us. There is a little bit of a hangover in some of the research but we expect that to go away in total through the balance of 2008. So very optimistic about Taco Bell and the team is very excited about what they\u2019ve got going, so I think you\u2019ll be pleased with the way we are taking the brand. ", "The other thing that is exciting about Taco Bell is that we had net new unit development last year in spite of all the problems that we had and this year it\u2019s going to be a plus too, so you\u2019ve got a concept here that\u2019s the second most profitable restaurant brand in the United States that only has 5,000 restaurants, 5,000 traditional restaurants. So we are not even close to cannibalizing ourselves and we\u2019ve got asset bases that we think we can do a lot and our future back business is to keep building the sales layers, much like McDonald\u2019s has done, to get us to ultimately over the longer term to 24 hours of operation. And we can do that with a real distinct positioning. Right now we have a 70% share of the Mexican quick service restaurant category, right around in that range. ", "So we are very bullish on Taco Bell. We\u2019re very glad that 2007 is behind us and we are very happy that we\u2019ve got 2008 just staring us in the face and we just want to put the numbers up on the board to get everybody feeling as great about Taco Bell as we are.

Just another question on China -- I wonder if you could give us any update on any potential impact on traffic or commodity from the recent storms that have impacted much of the country. Thanks.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Okay. Well, first I am pleased to report that neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow, nor dark of night can halt our China business. But it\u2019s had -- our team has had to work very hard given the weather that\u2019s been there in China. We\u2019ve had about 20 restaurant closures temporarily over the period of time, although those are now minimized. It\u2019s probably going to have about a one point impact for the quarter on our same-store sales growth and the extra cost of getting the product to our locations is sort of negligible, so that really won\u2019t impact us much. ", "But again, I would like to emphasize the logistics team we have in China -- first of all, that gives us the competitive advantage that we\u2019ve said before. We were able to work through a lot of these issues, especially the northern part of the country. And the logistics team together with our supply chain just really put out an all-out effort, so I was pleased we had the competitive advantage but I was also very pleased and thank the effort of our China team to get us through this.

Unfortunately, easy comparisons don\u2019t necessarily mean easy comparisons and maybe from your prepared remarks, can you pick one or two of the bold initiatives that are really going to transform the U.S. business and make a difference in 2008?", "David Novak", "Well, Howard, I just gave you about five in Taco Bell. I think when you look at Pizza Hut, I think what you are looking at Pizza Hut is we are launching the Tuscany Pastas, which I think is the biggest news of all that we have at Pizza Hut this year, in addition to the fact that we\u2019ve got an all-day, every day sales layer now with Pizza Mia, which allows us to compete more effectively for the lower end of the category, the value seekers. ", "We also I think have a much more effective discounting strategy which will pay off in terms of profitability, so those are the three big things at Pizza Hut and we continue to add Wing Streets but we\u2019ll be national advertise Wing Street by the end of -- by 2009. ", "The other -- when we look at KFC, I think KFC this year will be introducing a toasted line of grilled pressed products, which we think will be differentiated in the category. But we really see in terms of our longer term plan at KFC that 2009 will be our bigger, bolder initiative with the launch of the -- the planned launch of the grilled products. ", "So I feel we can have a solid year at KFC but I think the bigger initiative for KFC will be coming in 2009. ", "The other thing that we have at both KFC and Pizza Hut is that the franchisees have voted for incremental national advertising, so this allows us to really sell multiple layers of messages across the year. ", "For example, right now we are advertising Pizza Mia and our new crunchy pizza at Pizza Hut, which I think is a much more powerful punch than just launching Pizza Mia and forgetting about it. We\u2019re able to continually advertise Pizza Mia as a value layer throughout the year, plus have innovation like the cheesy crunch, plus introduce the pastas. So I think that\u2019s a big deal. ", "At KFC, we\u2019re able to do toasted wrap sandwiches and do high-end chicken on the bone to protect our chicken-on-the-bone base business. So that gives us the opportunity to have a one-two punch there as well. ", "So listen, do I wish we were overlapping a better year last year? Absolutely. In this kind of environment though, where everybody else seems like they have a lot more wind in their face, it\u2019s not bad to have a 2007 like we had to overlap, especially when you know you\u2019ve got a hell of a lot better programs than we had the previous years. ", "So I\u2019ll take that and I\u2019m very convinced that we can deliver 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and 5% profit growth in 2008 and you combine that with the power of China and the power of YRI, I think there are very few retailers, very few restaurant companies in the world that have the kind of play that we have this year as we go forward. And more importantly, more importantly to your point is that we know this is all about the long-term and when we look at our 35,000 restaurants around the world, we\u2019ve got opportunities for huge leverage. ", "That\u2019s why we are testing breakfast in Singapore. That\u2019s why we\u2019re testing breakfast in the U.K. Those are lead markets for international. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got fish going in the [inaudible]. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got beverages going in Australia. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got oven-roasted being tested in Malaysia. We have so many ways to leverage our existing assets, not only in the United States -- all this stuff will work around the world, which is one of the reasons why China is doing so well. They\u2019ve got a tea time at Pizza Hut casual dining. They\u2019ve got breakfast, they\u2019ve got beverages at KFC. We are on a major strategy to get much more asset leverage by being much more driven to bring relevant sales layers to our business.", "This is the same strategy that worked for McDonald\u2019s. It\u2019s the same strategy that\u2019s worked for us in China and we think that we will put wins on the board slowly and surely, but when you look at our business three years from now, you will look back and you will see a changed business clearly in the U.S. where we are upgrading our assets while we are doing all this stuff, and I also think you\u2019ll see a changed business in international because our assets will be better utilized as we go forward.

", "Operator", "Rachael Rothman, Merrill Lynch.", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys. Just to follow-up on the refranchising, can you talk -- it seems like the \u201907 target came in a little light of your initial guidance for I believe 600 units. It looks like it came in at three. Can you talk about what they dynamics are in the refranchising market currently and whether or not you are seeing any pressure on the multiples or cash flows and why you have confidence in the $1.1 billion, given the shortfalls in \u201906 and \u201907? Thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "First of all, regarding our original plan, we were very happy with the progress in \u201906. I\u2019ll talk about \u201907 in a minute but going forward, as you look at 2008 and beyond, a couple of points. First of all, the restaurants that we are selling at this point are some of our better performing restaurants by brand. So we have restaurants that we think are going to be very desirable to existing franchisees in particular but also as we go out, we do want to expand our franchisee base. So we are selling relatively good restaurants. ", "The second reason is the size of the deals that we come through are generally smaller type deals so the credit type crunch that is on bigger deals hasn\u2019t really yet hit that size market. Related to that, we\u2019ve never done crazy deals on leveraging, et cetera, so we\u2019ve always had common sense types of leverage. In fact, we require it. We don\u2019t allow people to over-leverage their business if they are franchising. So at this point, we are confident that the market conditions will allow us to do it. ", "Regarding \u201907, part of the reason we are selling a fairly big block of stores in California. We were hoping to get those done in \u201907. We are confident those will get done in \u201908 and we\u2019ll be back on track towards hitting our goal. ", "So like I said, I feel good about the progress that we are making and I feel good about our prospects. And we\u2019ve given ourselves three years to do it, so again I am still very confident under current conditions we\u2019ll be able to do that. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "And in terms of your G&A, I know you guys mentioned in the release something about maybe litigation costs. Are there any one-time costs that made your G&A higher? It was much higher than we would have thought. Were there any one-time items that we should be considering there?", "Richard T. Carucci", "There weren\u2019t any huge one-time items. The biggest increase year over year was the higher incentive pay. We did have a bunch of I\u2019d call smaller one-time items, so for example, we had consulting costs, [inaudible] and other areas. We had the world food program, et cetera. So we had a little -- we had a higher than normal closures. We probably pulled forward some that would have normally occurred in \u201908, so it\u2019s been more of a series of small items than one big item. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Steven Kron, Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Good morning. Following up on Rachael\u2019s questions on the G&A, on the corporate G&A, you mentioned things about strategic projects and I know you\u2019ve discussed this in the past but can you be a little bit more specific as to where those dollars were spent? And also, compared to the guidance provided in December, it seems like the first quarter of \u201908, there\u2019s going to be a little bit less of this stuff. So did you pull some of that strategic spending forward or is there just a change in the total dollars estimated going forward?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well as I said in answer to Rachael is we didn\u2019t have huge items so it\u2019s not like we took some huge buckets of money. But I\u2019ll give an example of something that we are pushing. As David talked about drinks, we\u2019re trying to get more resources against getting drinks started, so we had more spending against drinks in the fourth quarter of \u201908 than we had -- sorry, fourth quarter of \u201907 than we had before. ", "In terms of -- probably the one pull forward is really more around closures. We had a fair number of international closures that are a little higher than normal. That would probably be the only impact that would impact Q1 of \u201908. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then a second question just on the cash flow statement -- obviously a lot of focus on free cash flow generation, given what you guys have outlined as to cash returned to shareholders over time and the evolution of the business model. ", "I just look on a year-over-year basis, free cash flow grew around $140 million, $150 million and I know there\u2019s a lot of give and takes within the operating cash flow line but one thing just jumped out at me -- the changes in accounts payable delta on a year-over-year basis was around $150 million favorable, and I\u2019m just wondering -- is there anything different from changes in payment terms or anything like that that we should just be aware of?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, not really. There were no changes in payment terms at all. Accounts payable, depending on when our fiscal year closes or the quarter closes, the time of the month can vary quite a bit and that\u2019s just a factor of our retail business. So if the close happens to be in the middle of the month, sometimes our utility bills, which are pretty significant if you add up all the company stores we have, that can really driven the number in any given quarter or any fiscal year-end, just because of the timing of when that cut-off is. It\u2019s not related to any payment terms at all. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, I just wanted to make sure because versus history, it looks like a big jump. Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Virginia Chandler, J.P. Morgan.", "Virginia Chandler - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. A question on the planned $2 billion or slightly more than $2 billion of shareholder returns in 2008. How much of that are you budgeting to be funded by incremental debt versus internally generated cash? Thanks. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks for the question. If you go back to our Q3 earnings release, we did say we anticipated repurchasing up to $4 billion of our company shares over a two-year period looking forward. We did say it will be funded from company cash and new debt. We went to market and got $1.2 billion of cash from incremental debt in mid-October and we did expect that we would probably be doing more this year based on the leverage ratios that we committed to, publicly and with the rating agencies. ", "So we are looking at possibly going back to the public debt markets again this year, probably later in the year. We are going to try to be as flexible as we can. Unfortunately, we did get a very -- we renegotiated our credit facility also late last year and that gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility. Very good interest costs with its LIBOR plus I think 27 basis points, so we are going to utilize that as much as we can during the year in acquiring our stock back. Which you can see we did a lot of at the end of the year last year and we\u2019ll go to the market when we think it\u2019s right for us. You know, it\u2019s been very volatile but we will likely go back to the market but at the same time, we are going to try to utilize our credit facility, given the great interest cost.

A couple of bookkeeping type questions first -- on the YRI comments about the operating profit growth being negatively impacted by five points, and you mentioned some spending initiatives and what not, where does that fall in the income statement? Is that primarily G&A or is that spread throughout the income statement?", "Richard T. Carucci", "It\u2019s primarily G&A and also in franchise and license expense. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and then on the refranchising, I noticed your 2010 goals are the same. At one point you thought you could get down to 17% company units by the end of \u201908. Is that still an interim target or is that slipping a bit?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, mathematically it ends up being pretty close, Joe. We don\u2019t -- we sort of look at the below 10% as our new target but we\u2019re around 22 today, so if you straight line going from 22 to 10, you get fairly close to that. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Okay, and then just a question on trends and through your businesses -- first of all in the U.S., there\u2019s been a lot of talk about potential slowing in QSR and I realize you\u2019ve got these year-over-year comparisons that are going to match some of that but I\u2019m just kind of curious of your read on the QSR business in the U.S., you know, what you are seeing. It seems like KFC slowed down a bit at the end of the quarter. I\u2019m curious what you are seeing so far in \u201908, if you\u2019ll comment. ", "And then conversely, just what drove China so dramatically in the fourth quarter and how sustainable do you think those very strong trends in China are?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Let me take the China question first and then I\u2019ll let David talk about his view on the U.S. ", "You know, China, you can never anticipate a quarter as strong as that one going forward. I mean, as an example, in the fourth quarter when we added -- in December when we added 90 restaurants, our traffic growth was double-digit and we told you we took some pricing increases during the course of the year, so you are not going to have months like that always but it\u2019s obviously a great month to build on to. So we are confident that China does have momentum, the economy there still has momentum, so we feel very bullish about China in \u201908. Obviously have  a huge for-ex benefit as we in \u201908, so we feel very good about China in \u201908 although I can\u2019t promise quarters like this fourth quarter every time. ", "Joe Buckley - Bear Stearns", "Is there anything you guys did to stimulate the business in the fourth quarter?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I mentioned the fish program I thought was very successful, so I think we did better than the industry because of that program and obviously we just have a very strong business year-in and year-out. So that was probably the one activity we did that sort of maybe made it stronger than usual. ", "David Novak", "I think the other thing in China is that when brands are really working on all cylinders and you\u2019ve got your positioning and your advertising right and your operations are excellent, it\u2019s kind of hard to slow yourself down when an economy is growing and there are more and more people buying your food. ", "So I would not want to underestimate just the great job the China team is doing marketing and operating their brand and that -- from every measure we\u2019ve seen, our brand tracking indicators are at all-time highs. So that\u2019s a lot of power you\u2019ve got working for you and I think the asset leverage plays that we\u2019ve made at both Pizza Hut and KFC are really paying off. Everything from Pizza Hut from having proprietary beverages with the tea time and moving into the snacking occasion in the afternoon to KFC having proprietary desserts like the egg tarts, to their nine lives juice to fish to pork -- this brand stretches into a whole lot of different categories so every month, we\u2019ve got something new we\u2019re talking about to build on the base, so that pipeline is full and it\u2019s robust. And I think that\u2019s building fuel into the business. ", "I think in the U.S., there are so many of you that follow our industry. You are probably better than I am in terms of really trying to gauge where the economy is and the impact and what the real trends are. I mean, you are looking at every business out there, Joe, and there\u2019s probably not too many guys any better at it than you. ", "I can only say in times like this, the biggest thing you have to be is you have to be good. And we\u2019ve done a lot of studies. We\u2019ve looked at recessionary periods. We\u2019ve looked at consumer sentiment. We\u2019ve look at a lot of things. And I think in every situation, you\u2019d much rather operate obviously in a better environment. But what we have found historically is the brands that are positioned well, the brands that have the most news, the brands that have the best value proposition, they win, even in the toughest times. ", "I think that we are not recession proof but I do think that we are, we have brands that can fare much better than other brands and other categories at times like these. And you know, I had a level 12 meeting -- that\u2019s our directors and above -- meeting last week with our people and I talked about this and I think the way we look at this is we have a real opportunity to distinguish ourselves as a company in a tough environment like this by really delivering a strong U.S. year and continuing to show the portfolio power of our business in terms of China and international. You know, after doing six straight years of 10% growth with lots of different challenges over the years, we ought to put another up on the board. And in particular, we want to keep obviously our global strength and momentum going but get some momentum going in the U.S. while we establish even stronger programs for the future.

Speiser - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thanks very much. Good morning. A couple of questions, first on chicken costs. Now that 2007 is over, can you give us a sense of what your U.S. chicken costs were on a year-over-year basis, perhaps first half/second half? And as you look out to \u201908, can you give us a sense of how much you are exposed to chicken costs? I know you have some costs plus arrangements and so maybe if you can address that but also, the amount of requirements that are not contracted at all. ", "And then if I could just throw in a second, separate question -- KFC, I guess it seems to have been weak in the fourth quarter and for \u201907 and I\u2019m just wondering if KFC's average check is perhaps a bell-weather for the consumer and if you can give us a sense of if the average check was up or down in the fourth quarter at KFC. Thanks. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "On the commodities, I think the one thing in looking back that we can tell you is that of the -- I think it was $44 million in the U.S. for last year, almost half of that was in the fourth quarter. So a lot of it was Q4 and even looking forward, a fair amount of the inflation we expect for 2008 will happen in the first half for sure and particularly in Q1. So that gives you a little bit of the skewing. ", "In terms of chicken, it was pretty much level throughout the year because on chicken in the U.S., we\u2019re typically contracted. There was some hedging that goes on based around the chicken-on-the-bone products but most of the chicken products are contracted for the year and that\u2019s the same case going forward. ", "When we talked about commodity inflation for \u201908, we said 5% to 6% inflation. We feel pretty good about that. If you look back last year at this same time, we said 3% to 4% in the U.S. and we came in right in the middle of that range in actual terms. And the teams that we have focused on that do a pretty darn good job of looking at the market and what we have locked up and what we don\u2019t and we end up coming out very close to those expectations. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Telsey Advisory Group", "Tim, just on that point, the cost plus arrangements that you have, is there exposure to cost plus? I know you are contracted but are there escalations in there?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, the big exposure we have on -- the exposure that we have on cost plus is that as our suppliers grow out the chickens, whatever they feed them, corn and soy meal, that\u2019s charged to us at current market prices and we hedge that through the forward commodity markets on a rolling forward four quarter basis. So there is protection against that as well. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Telsey Advisory Group", "Okay, thanks. And then if you can talk about my second question about KFC average check?", "Tim Jerzyk", "KFC average check for the year?", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Telsey Advisory Group", "For the fourth quarter and year, that would be great. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "There wasn\u2019t -- we can hook up with you later in terms of more details but I don\u2019t recall there being any significant movement in KFC check. ", "Operator", "Jason West, Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks a lot. I was wondering, just for clarification on the guidance, if that now excludes any refranchising gains or losses for 2008. I believe the original guidance had included about $20 million to $50 million in gains on refranchising activity. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "The full year guidance excludes the 20 to 50, it excludes charges in the U.S. business related to restructuring and any investments we make in the business, and it excludes the Japan gain we expect in Q1 of $87 million. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and you guys say in the first quarter, we\u2019ll see a $20 million loss in refranchising? I was just wondering if you could talk about what was that one transaction that drove that loss or what was the make-up of that?", "Richard T. Carucci", "The way the accounting works is that when you float a deal where there\u2019s an expected loss, you effectively recognize that loss when that deal is floated. If you expect to gain then you don\u2019t recognize that until the deal is closed. ", "So what\u2019s happened in the first quarter of \u201908, we floated some expected loss deals, mostly Long John Silver related. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then last thing, on the VAT lap that you have in the Mexico business of $30 million, would that fall within the segment for YRI or would that fall within the consolidated tax rate?", "Richard T. Carucci", "That would fall within operating profit for YRI. YRI reported numbers in 2008 unfortunately have the VAT included as a negative in their operating profit but that one-time Japan gain sits outside of YRI, and we put that in the one-timers.

", "Operator", "Your final question is a follow-up from David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Two quick ones; first, maybe Rick, outside the U.S., are you seeing any slowing in any markets anywhere in a way that feels macro? And if so, where?", "And then maybe Dave, your U.S. chains, we\u2019ve talked about this before, have a larger dinner business than perhaps the hamburger chains have as a percentage of your sales. And I\u2019m wondering, do you view that as a particular challenge for Yum!, essentially making Yum! more subject to discretionary spending pull-backs in your view and perhaps having ramifications for how much volatility we could see in light of the macro concerns this year, and perhaps how are you thinking about your 2008 marketing and innovation, is that really targeted towards defending dinner? I see it with Pizza Hut but I\u2019m perhaps not seeing it so much with your other teams. Thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Let me take the first part. Overall our trends at YRI are very favorable, so we feel good that we are entering 2008. We entered 2008 with momentum. We\u2019ll have the typical YRI results. I mean, don\u2019t forget 2007 was very unusual. We had very few countries with weak results. Almost everybody was strong and we\u2019ll probably have some countries that are up and down but I haven\u2019t seen anything across countries that look like a macro trend. ", "So overall, we feel we are in good shape. The one macro thing that we did talk about in December and it\u2019s still there is we do expect to see more global inflation than we normally do but again remember, we\u2019re a franchise business and we\u2019re really not that susceptible to major bumps based on that. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Okay, thanks. ", "David Novak", "I think on the -- if you look at just the dinner SKUs at Pizza Hut and KFC and just look at our portfolio in total, the value proposition that we absolutely feel the very best about going into this category is Taco Bell, because that\u2019s half of our profits and we are ranked number one on value and just in terms of the amount of what you get for what you pay, so we have tremendous core equity there and I think we are most insulated, most insulated on the value front today at Taco Bell. ", "Regarding dinner, it is a higher guest check but what you do see that\u2019s going on in the category is tremendous trade-down in casual dining, so we are still very affordable at dinner versus the casual dining people, but I think the real challenge for us is to bring more compelling news to compete more effectively in that segment. ", "And what we tried to do on the value front for dinner at Pizza Hut is to shore that up by the launch of Pizza Mia, which is not an in-and-out product but it\u2019s every day, you can get three pizzas for $15 at Pizza Hut. So I think that gives us more strength than what we\u2019ve had to compete more effectively at dinner for that particular occasion, while we innovate around new pizzas and bring pasta and chicken into the equation with Wing Street. ", "So I think we\u2019re -- you know, it\u2019s not quite the value proposition that we have at Taco Bell but we\u2019ve done some things to shore it up. ", "I think our value perception at KFC is one of the biggest things that we have to work on as we look towards the long-term transformation of that business. We don\u2019t have an every day value meal at the low end and I think that that\u2019s not in our favor. ", "What we are doing this year though is we are launching a line of oven-toasted products with our grill press that we think will make us much more competitive on the low-end and you\u2019ll be seeing that. ", "But the incremental advertising that the franchisees have approved have allowed us to do that and also reinforce our dinner occasion, so we are hoping for a more effective one-two punch. ", "So in summary, in terms of how are we positioned from a value perspective, we think Taco Bell is in excellent shape. We think Pizza Hut is in better shape than it\u2019s ever been. KFC is in a more difficult challenge but has taken some move on the product news front that will hopefully mitigate some of the issues. ", "But I think the lower your entry price point is, like a Taco Bell, I think in today\u2019s environment is better. So I think anybody in dinner does have a little bit more of a challenge. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Do we have anymore questions, Luanne?", "Operator", "No, sir, there are no further questions at this time. ", "David Novak", "So let me just briefly wrap it up here -- I think as we look to 2008, we think our total portfolio and the improvement that we expect to show in the U.S. will give us another year of consistent EPS growth of at least 10%. You will also see a lot of global growth this year. We are going to be opening up 1,500 new restaurants around the world and finally, each of our businesses will generate free cash flow, giving us the capability to return over $2 billion to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends.

Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) Q2 2008 Earnings Call July 17, 2008  9:15 AM ET", "Executives", "Tim Jerzyk - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "David C. Novak\u00a0- Chairman of the Board, President, Chief Executive Officer", "Richard T. Carucci - Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America ", "Steve West - Stifel Nicolaus", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "David Palmer - UBS", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Operator", "", "Good morning. My name is Kristy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn today\u2019s conference over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Kristy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website at www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording. ", "I would also like to advise that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s expectations based on currently available data. However, actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties. The information in this conference call related to projections or other forward-looking statements may be relied on subject to our Safe Harbor statement included in the earnings release last night and may continue to be used while the call remains in the active portion of the company\u2019s website at www.yum.com.", "In addition, we would like you to please be aware of two upcoming Yum! investor events. First, September 22nd and 23rd this year, we will host our fourth annual China investor conference in Shanghai. Please notify us if you plan to attend as soon as you can and if you do plan to attend, you need to make plans now to obtain your official visa. We would love to have all of you attend. It will be a great event. ", "Second, Tuesday, October 7th, third quarter earnings will be released. Those are the two key dates ahead for us. ", "Today on our call, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. Now I will turn the call over to David Novak.", "David C. Novak", "Thank you, Tim and good morning, everyone. Last night we release our second quarter earnings and I am pleased to report we posted solid second quarter EPS growth of 16%, excluding special items, and confidently raised our full year EPS growth forecast to 12%, continuing to build our track record of consistent performance year after year. ", "As you may know, I like to say that Yum! is not your ordinary restaurant company. We have had seven straight years of building more than 1,000 international units per year, making us consistently one of the largest global retailers. We are a truly global growth company with well over 50% of our profits coming from overseas, and that\u2019s largely franchisee driven. ", "We expect to report nearly $1.5 billion of franchise fees this year. KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, our key brands, are each leaders in their respective categories and with this tremendous diversity in brands and geography, we have the ability to weather tough times and unexpected events like we\u2019ve had in the past, and 2008 should be no exception. ", "Our success continues to be driven by our two sizable high return international businesses, China and YRI, which is Yum! Restaurants International. Our rapid growth China division had profit growth of 38% this quarter and YRI, our broad-based, primarily franchised international business, grew profit by 18%. ", "Importantly, these results were built on top of strong year-ago performances, a testament to the strength and growing power of our brands in the hundred-plus countries in which we operate. ", "In the U.S., we saw profit decline in the quarter versus prior year as we weather record-breaking commodity inflation. For the longer term, I am pleased with the progress we are making on improving our brands positions, increasing consumer relevance, and growing sales with system same-store sales up 2% this quarter. That\u2019s our fourth straight quarter of growth in this challenging environment. ", "With the strength of the momentum we have in our China and YRI businesses and improving picture for the U.S., we are confident of continued growth overall for Yum! and its shareholders in 2008, which is why we are raising our 2008 earnings per share forecast a second time this year, reaffirming our annual commitment to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% year after year. We now expect to generate $1.89 per share, or 12% growth excluding special items. This is a $0.02 increase versus our previous guidance provided in our first quarter earnings release. This would be our seventh straight year of meeting and exceeding this annual EPS growth commitment. ", "Next, let me cover each of our businesses in the context of our four key growth strategies. Number one, build leading brands in China in every significant category; number two, drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere; three, dramatically improve U.S. brand positions, consistency, and returns; and number four, drive industry leading long-term shareholder and franchisee value. ", "So I\u2019ll start with China, where we continue to build and fortify our strong foundation in every significant restaurant category, which we expect will provide years of consistent growth in the future. Mainland China continues to hit the ball out of the park, with same-store sales growth of 14%, topping our spectacular first quarter performance. Importantly for the long-term development of our business in China, we continued very strong unit growth of 20% or nearly 100 new units. Putting into perspective our position, we expect to reach 3,000 restaurants on the ground in more than 500 cities in this mega-market by the end of the year. This is a phenomenal result and speaks to the power of our superior brand equity and maniacal execution in China. ", "Our KFC team is leading the way on the development and implementation of sales growth initiatives, including new proteins like fish, day part expansion through delivery, and the continued expansion of our breakfast menu. KFC's pipeline is definitely full of exciting new products we rolled out in the first half of the year, such as our new Shrimp Sandwich, as well as others coming in the second half. ", "Our Pizza Hut casual dining concept is the undisputed leader in Mainland China\u2019s western casual dining category with over 380 units. We expect to end the year with over 400 units, up over 50 new units versus the prior year. Pizza Hut casual dining is also working on building sales growth initiatives, including the tea time day part, and is upgrading its menu approach to add quality, variety with menu updates targeted every six months. ", "Our exciting new growth brand, Pizza Hut home service, also continues to perform well. By year-end, we expect to add over 20 new units, bringing our total to about 80 in over 10 cities. Home service is a rapidly emerging growth area of the mainland China restaurant industry and we are working to capitalize on this opportunity with a business model geared specifically for that at-home occasion. ", "And finally, we continue to make great progress on our emerging growth brand, East Dawning, our Chinese fast food concept which now has 14 units. We continue to expand in Shanghai and have also opened in Beijing with our newest location in Beijing\u2019s international airport just in time for the Olympics. We expect to open three new units in Beijing during 2008, as we build what we expect will be China\u2019s number one Chinese fast food brand. ", "For those of you who have followed our success over the years in China, you know we have a huge strategic advantage and great headstart, with our stable and experienced management team in Shanghai, our expansive state-of-the-art distribution system, our dedicated manufacturing capabilities, and our large-scale development team, all of which combine to produce results that are unmatched by any company in Mainland China and gives us confidence in our long-term vision to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. ", "Finally, I\u2019ve been inspired by the spirit and soul of the Chinese people as they responded to bravely and humanely to the earthquake in May. Our team members, along with the entire country, have worked 24/7 and volunteered both time and resources to support the recovery effort. Fortunately, the restaurants that were affected by this disaster have been reopened and most importantly, none of our team members were hurt during the earthquake. ", "We saw an initial impact on consumer spending but as you\u2019ve seen from our earnings report, the business rebounded quickly and had outstanding performance. The people of China have clearly faced a number of challenging natural disasters this year and are obviously now preparing for the Olympic Games. We expect the entire world to be impressed by the growth of this country and the heart of their people. ", "Next on to YRI, where we are driving aggressive international expansion and building strong brands everywhere. Now as I noted earlier, YRI had another really good quarter, with profit growth of 18% fueled by a 15% growth in system sales. Importantly, YRI continues to build on strong performances each year and this quarter is another great example of the consistent, broad-based growth this business can produce. ", "The key driver underlying YRI\u2019s profit growth is the worldwide development capability of our 700-plus franchisees in over a hundred countries. We opened over 150 new restaurants in the second quarter and year-to-date, we are ahead of last year\u2019s record pace, well on our way to another record this year. ", "YRI same-store sales growth in the second quarter was an impressive 4% growth lapping a strong 5% growth a year ago. This performance is especially strong, given the pace of our new unit development and speaks to our strong unit economic model and the pull we get from franchisees to invest further in our brands. ", "As a result of our development in same-store sales growth, our system sales grew by 8% excluding foreign currency benefit. Our franchise business units around the globe were a key factor in this performance, with the Middle East up 27%, South Africa up 19%, Europe up 16%, the Caribbean up 15%, and Asia up 7%, all excluding foreign currency impact. ", "YRI is continuing to build on a strong competitive position, planning for future growth with three key strategies -- development of emerging mega-markets, building new and permanent sales growth initiatives, and adding new brands to their portfolio. In key emerging markets like India and Russia, we have over 150 units each, and Vietnam is now closing in on 50 units in a country with 85 million people with China like economics, a country where key U.S. competition has yet to even build a single unit. ", "In Brazil, we found a strong partner who has the now-how to operate well in the country and is excited about expanding KFC and Brazil with nearly 200 million people to go after. ", "Importantly, around the world our franchisees are as excited as we are about the future growth of our brands as we continue to develop in both new and existing markets. ", "In various markets around the world, YRI is also testing and building new sales growth initiatives and seeing encouraging results, with the potential for these ideas to take our brands to even higher sales levels. Our KFC breakfast program in Asia and the United Kingdom, testing fish at KFC in the Middle East and the Caribbean, new drink innovation, beverage innovation in Australia, Pizza Hut tea time in Indonesia, marketing the Pizza Hut enhanced dine-in experience in Hong Kong -- these are all just basically represent a brief list of the flavor of the range of ideas we\u2019re working on, as well as the geographical breadth of our business and how we leverage that to our benefit as we develop sales growth initiatives. ", "YRI also continues to make progress on expanding our existing brand portfolio. We are growing Taco Bell in already successful markets like Costa Rica and Guatemala, and our new entry markets like Mexico and in the next 12 months, Spain, India, and the United Arab Emirates. ", "PHD, our new delivery focused brand, is now in eight countries and seeing encouraging results as we test and prove out this pizza delivery concept with economics designed specifically to compete effectively in the delivery at-home occasion. ", "To summarize, we are pleased with the momentum of YRI\u2019s business as we well exceed our annual at least 5% growth target for system sales on a local currency basis, and open well over 750 new restaurants and exceed our annual commitment of at least 10% profit growth for that division. ", "Turning to the U.S., where our strategy is to dramatically improve our brand position and returns through new major sales growth initiatives, product innovation, and meaningful differentiation versus our competition, we generated second quarter system same-store sales growth of 2%, our fourth consecutive quarter of growth. Profit was down 12%, primarily as a result of substantial commodity inflation and an under-performing KFC business. ", "As we go forward, we have laser-like focus on better leveraging our substantial U.S. restaurant asset base with sales of growth initiatives in five areas, more options for consumers across our menus, more contemporary beverage options and unique desserts, expanded day parts, broader protein offerings, and contemporizing our assets. ", "We are confident that we are taking the right choices and the right steps to lead us to stronger brand positioning, higher returns, and consistent growth performance to unlock the value inherent in our 18,000 U.S. stores. ", "Our business in the U.S. is a tale of two cities -- Taco Bell and Pizza Hut are both having very good years, while KFC continues to struggle. More importantly, we are pleased that all three are making progress on our long-term strategies for sustainable growth. KFC quite simply just has more ground to cover. ", "Now let\u2019s briefly review the progress we\u2019ve made thus far at each of our leading brands. The Taco Bell brand is as strong as ever with the introduction of why pay more, our new value oriented menu, and the Fruitista Freeze, our new beverage line. We\u2019ve been happily surprised by the extent of our success in this tough environment as both have exceeded our expectations upon national launch. Why pay more is resonating with customers in today\u2019s economic environment, and where else can you find a menu with $0.79, $0.89, and $0.99 price points and the great selection we have? Our $0.89 Cheesy Double Beef Burrito has 38% more food and 30% more beef than McDonald\u2019s $0.99 Double-Cheeseburger, and so our customers realize it truly is a great value. ", "Our Fruitista Freeze drinks are simply great products differentiated with real natural fruit that gives us a unique edge and helps drive transactions throughout the day. Look for more news in the future to build on the success of both why pay more and Fruitista Freeze. ", "Also note that we will undergo more testing of our great taste, less fat and calories line of products call Fresco, breakfast and -- we\u2019ll do that as well as test breakfast and premium proteins in possible areas like fish and chicken. ", "As we build these successful sales layers, we plan to accelerate our development of Taco Bell in the U.S. Remember that Taco Bell has a little over 5,000 units versus McDonald\u2019s 14,000 units within the U.S., and we\u2019ll have net new unit growth this year at Taco Bell. We think Taco Bell can be a Mexican inspired concept that grows towards the scale of McDonald\u2019s over the long-term. ", "So in summary, Taco Bell is doing all the right things to build the business profitably, adding significant sales growth layers and generating profit growth in 2008. I really appreciate the aggressive focus of our team and we are on track for great things in the future. ", "As I\u2019ve said, Pizza Hut is also having a very good year and clearly outperforming its competitors. That\u2019s because we are reinventing the brand and delivery category as we drive aggressively against our vision of the Pizza Hut brand providing America with pizza, pasta, and chicken, expanding beyond the pizza category into whole meal replacement. ", "Tuscany Pasta, our exciting new premium pasta line launched earlier this year, is off to a roaring start and exceeding our expectations. We believe this is one of Pizza Hut's very best and one of its mot important product launches in its 50-year history. We launched with two pasta options, Cheesy Chicken Alfredo and Meaty Marinara as our two core products, and we\u2019ve seen families looking for an alternative yet affordable break from kitchen duty choose our Tuscany Pasta and really enjoy it. It is receiving great review from food critics for both its taste and value. Remember, it\u2019s three pounds of pasta for $11.99. That\u2019s value. ", "So we are optimistic this will be an important sales layer for Pizza Hut and our long-term bowl goal is to make it as big as pizza. We are thinking about pasta as a major new avenue to grow our business down the line. ", "An important consumer barrier for Pizza Hut in the past has been everyday value. We believe that this year we have begun to make important steps to solve this issue for both families and individuals through Pizza Mia and the Pizzone. Our Pizza Mia is great for groups that want a lot of pizza -- the multiple pizza occasion for a low price, $5 per pizza and it\u2019s a great tasting pizza, to boot. ", "Pizzone is a great value for individuals weighing in at over a pound -- not the individuals weighing in over a pound but the Pizzone weighing in at over a pound for a price point of $5.99. I\u2019d like to see that one-pound individual. ", "We expect to add even more options to each of these sales growth layers in the near future. Our pipeline is full of new ways to grow both pasta and our value propositions. ", "Longer term, we\u2019re beginning to gain solid momentum with the rollout of Wing Street at Pizza Hut with nearly 400 units converted year-to-date and over 1,500 total units. Wing Street provides a great breaded line of flavored chicken wings and protein variety to our menu. The franchises are now fully behind the rollout of Wing Street and we are well on our way to bringing Wing Street to a national launch as an important sub-brand of Pizza Hut. We expect to be in position to advertise America\u2019s largest wing brand on national TV in the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "In summary for Pizza Hut, our new permanent sales layer approach is proving successful and we remain confident of our ability to grow the Pizza Hut brand in the U.S. in a very challenging category and transform it into a much broader home meal replacement business. Believe me, the team has a great vision and is making great progress at executing it. ", "Now, our U.S. KFC business is our only major soft spot in the world and had a challenging quarter with the decline in sales. While sales were weak, we believe we have the right strategies to turn this brand around as we reinforce the heritage of our traditional delicious fried chicken and bring on great products like the new range of Kentucky grilled chicken products currently in test. The strategy is to move beyond fried chicken and offer chicken in more contemporary portable forums -- chicken any way you want it. We are in the very early stages of this work but we are right on track. ", "Now, as you may have read, Greg [Deedrick] is retiring from KFC as President of KFC and will be actually retiring at the end of the year to pursue other interests. And I can\u2019t tell you how pleased I am to be able to showcase the global strength of Yum!'s bench of capable management talent with the appointment of Roger Eden as KFC's new President. Roger brings tremendous experience leading our business, including seven years running our KFC business in Australia, where he delivered consistent, same-store sales growth in a highly competitive, highly penetrated market. You may know he most recently served as Yum!'s chief operating and development officer. Roger is a great leader and has hit the ground running. He\u2019s already driving initiatives and leveraging successes we have had in other markets around the globe and the franchisees are very excited to have him at the helm. ", "In summary, while this year\u2019s performance at KFC is lagging our other brands, the KFC turnaround is underway. We have the right strategies and know what we need to do. We are laying an important long-term foundation for the future success of KFC, have significant testing underway right now, and expect to deliver much better results in 2009. ", "To wrap up the U.S. business, give the macro environment in 2008, Taco Bell is clearly our best-positioned U.S. brand with its value leadership in the industry and its entry level QSR pricing for the individual eating occasion. Pizza Hut is having a very good year and making great progress with new permanent sales layers in value, pasta, and chicken. ", "KFC will continue to test Kentucky Grilled Chicken during the balance of 2008 in preparation for the planned national launch in the first half of 2009. Most importantly, we are making steady progress in developing a broader range of customer options across all of our U.S. brands, which we believe will strengthen our brand positioning and lead to more consistent growth performance. ", "Finally, we are driving even more urgency around operations and executing to our standards. We know we can run much better restaurants and provide much more consistent quality and service that we know our customers expect. ", "Our final growth strategy is to drive industry-leading, long-term shareholder and franchisee value. The good news is that we are already a leader in returns, not only among restaurant companies but among large cap global consumer companies as well. ", "On an after-tax basis, our return on invested capital is 18%, so we\u2019re starting from a position of real strength. The fact is that Yum! Brands is an incredible cash machine, with each of our three businesses generating free cash flow, effectively funding their own capital investments. As this capital is deployed to high return opportunities, for example, new restaurants in China where the cash pay-back has been only two years, we expect our total returns to remain strong. These returns will improve further as we continue to refranchise restaurants in the U.S. and at Yum! Restaurants International and build our major sales growth initiatives to better utilize our restaurant assets. ", "With our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we remain committed to returning $2 billion to the shareholders in 2008 through share buy-backs and our significant dividend program. We\u2019ve already returned $1.1 billion in the first half of the year. ", "We\u2019re proud of the fact that we are one of the few companies that can make significant capital investments for growth year over year and make great investments in large scale share buy-backs while adding shareholder value, and pay a meaningful dividend and deliver double-digit EPS growth. ", "Our commitment is to continue this tradition of rewarding our shareholders with superior returns. ", "Before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to share with you a brief perspective into how we are planning and preparing for 2009 as we look to continuing to build our track record of consistent growth in what may remain a very challenging global economic environment. ", "First, the Yum! global development machine will deliver over 1600 new units this year, which we expect will provide incremental sales and profit growth in 2009. As well, we have a strong pipeline of new sites that we expect will deliver a similar number of new units in 2009. ", "Second, you will see us continue to reinforce and introduce meaningful value-oriented sales initiatives into each of our businesses, like the why pay more menu at Taco Bell or Pizzone at Pizza Hut, which we believe will provide real value to our customers in these challenging economic times. ", "At the same time, we are leveraging our extensive know-how on menu mix management, which allows us to take pricing in this high inflation environment on our premium products. ", "Third, we are adding relevant new products for our customers, including the Fruitista Freeze, Tuscany Pasta and other, and we\u2019re confident in our pipeline of new products for 2009. We will continue to expand the new Taco Bell Fruitista Freeze beverage line and the new Tuscany line of pastas at Pizza Hut. ", "Watch for more product excitement around these new product lines later this year and get ready for the launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken in 2009, as well as the expansion of beverages, breakfast, and multiple proteins in many parts of the globe. ", "Finally, as you would expect in any well-managed company, we\u2019re concentrating on aggressive G&A management and careful investment of resources around these activities that drive growth. We are proactively pursuing productivity gains as we pursue major initiatives in our business. ", "We believe that all these will help us achieve the consistent financial performance our shareholders expect from Yum! in 2009 and fuel the growth machine that is Yum! Brands, a performer that consistently delivers at least 10% earnings per share growth every single year. That\u2019s our goal, we\u2019ve done it in the past, and we fully expect to do it in the future. ", "Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Rick Carucci, our CFO, for more on the financial performance. Rick. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. In this section of our call, I\u2019m going to comment on four items. First, Yum!'s second quarter results; second, a brief update of our U.S. refranchising program; third, our current full-year outlook for 2008; and fourth, a perspective on 2009. ", "Starting with our second quarter results, I\u2019d like to one more highlight two foundations of Yum!'s financial story, our consistency of our overall results and our global growth. First, our second quarter and first half results demonstrate that we are well on our way for the seventh straight year to meeting our annual commitment to deliver EPS growth of at least 10%. I am personally very proud of this consistent financial performance. ", "Second, we continue to expand our business around the world, open 255 new units outside the U.S. in the second quarter. That\u2019s equivalent to three new restaurants every day. Both our China and YRI businesses are on pace to match or exceed last year\u2019s record development. Based on this performance, we are increasing our 2008 international development guidance from 1200 to 1300 units. Consistent and significant unit growth continues to be a critical component of our global growth story each year. ", "Now I\u2019d like to comment on the second quarter results of our three key businesses. First, our China division had another impressive quarter. Top line growth was led by exceptionally strong same-store sales growth of 14%, in addition to continued 20% unit growth in Mainland China. ", "On the cost side, we remain challenged by the inflationary environment in Mainland China, driven by commodities. This resulted in an expected one point decline in restaurant margin. ", "Overall, our strong top line performance generated extremely strong profit growth of 26% versus last year. That\u2019s excluding a substantial foreign currency benefit. Importantly, this profit growth was achieved while we continue to make P&L investments in our future growth engines, Pizza Hut home service and East Dawning. ", "As you would expect, we are very focused on our restaurant margin as we work to continue our strong performance and we expect a full year margin of about 20% in our Mainland China business. We are pleased we could maintain this type of margin performance in this highly inflationary environment while at the same time continuing our record pace of development. ", "Importantly, our new stores continue to perform well with our overall Mainland China margin at 20% and our cash margins exceeding 25%. We are particularly pleased by our new store performance in tier three and tier four cities, which generate positive margins in the first year and pay-back on investment in two years. ", "Yum! Restaurants international delivered another strong quarter. Profits were up 9% on a constant currency basis, lapping 11% growth in 2007. These results are even more impressive when you consider the loss of a VAT tax exemption in our Mexico business, which alone was an 11-point negative impact on growth. ", "Clearly YRI has outperformed in the first half versus our income expectations. Importantly, like China, YRI also generated a strong top line performance with 4% same-store sales growth and 4% net unit growth. ", "Additionally, due to the favorable impact of foreign currency conversion, we realized a profit upside of $9 million in the quarter. Ultimately, it is our established presence in a multitude of growing markets, coupled with our franchise business model that make YRI a crucial part of Yum!'s overall growth story. ", "U.S. profit results declined 12% in the second quarter, driven by a continuation of significant commodity inflation, weak sales and profit growth at KFC, and as anticipated, lapping insurance favorability from 2007. Importantly, our same-store sales growth of 2% for the system and 4% for company restaurants in quarter two was in line with our full-year targets. However, this level of sales could not offset the impact of record level commodity inflation. Quarter two commodity inflation of $30 million is a level we have not seen in one quarter and would usually represent what we\u2019d typically see in a full year. ", "In our first quarter earnings call, we shared with you that we would be lapping insurance favorability from quarter two 2007. lapping this favorability in 2008 negatively impacted our U.S. operating profit growth by $18 million, therefore most of our second quarter profit downside in the U.S., or $18 million of the total $23 million, was due to this insurance lapping issue. ", "On the financial side, Yum!'s second quarter results benefited from a lower effective tax rate and a lower average shares outstanding. Higher interest expense partially offset these positives, as we expected. ", "Now let\u2019s go through a brief update on U.S. refranchising. In December last year, we announced our intention to reduce our U.S. ownership to below 10% by the end of 2010. After refranchising 159 units in the second quarter, our year-to-date total now stands at 179 units. We are comfortable we will be able to refranchise at least 500 stores for the full year, given the solid deal pipeline we have in the balance of this year. Thus far in the third quarter, we have already refranchised an additional 90 units.  ", "Obviously the credit market conditions have affected refranchising efforts, and as a result the credit markets have increased their equity requirements for the buyer. Additionally, lenders have intensified their review process, which has added time to complete certain larger transactions. ", "In this environment, therefore, it has become more difficult to complete larger deals, so we expect our transactions this year to be skewed towards smaller deals. ", "Our strategy continues to be to find the best franchise partners that will drive business for the long-term and at the same time realize fair value for our assets. We will not compromise either one of these objectives. Our goal remains to potentially surpass 90% franchise ownership by 2010. This refranchising will result in positive benefits to U.S. restaurant margin, positive benefits to operating margin and Yum! ROIC, as well as less demand for capital from our U.S. business. ", "With the first half now completed, let\u2019s quickly cover our 2008 full-year outlook. As David already mentioned, on the back of our strong first half we have raised our full-year EPS growth forecast to $1.95 on a reported basis or $1.89 when we exclude special items. This forecast assumes the following: over-performance by our China and YRI divisions when compared to their long-term operating profit growth targets of 20% and 10% respectively. This over-performance reflects very strong year-to-date results, substantial for-ex benefits, above target same-store sales growth, and continued strong unit development. These items more than offset a one point decline in restaurant margin for both our China and YRI businesses. ", "For the balance of the year, I would like to highlight YRI\u2019s Q3 and Q4 profit growth rates. In the third quarter, we expect YRI will be below our first half profit growth rate as they lap strong year-ago performance. In the fourth quarter, we expect the growth rate to return to the normal range of our annual guidance. ", "Also, while we expect China to meet or exceed our full-year profit growth targets, we cannot expect mid-teens same-store sales growth and 30% to 40% profit growth to continue. ", "Our forecast for 2008 also assumes under-performance by our U.S. business when compared to its long-term operating profit growth target of 5%. We now expect a decline in full-year U.S. profit based on weakness in the first half performance. We also expect record U.S. commodity inflation of over $100 million for the year, well up from our original forecast of $55 million. ", "We expect U.S. profit performance to improve in the second half of the year as our pricing actions will begin to catch up with commodity inflation. For the full-year, we expect company same-store sales growth of 3%, which is at the high-end of our target range. ", "On the financial side, we expect a significant benefit from our share buy-backs leading to an approximately 8% reduction in our average shares outstanding. At this point, we expect a full-year effective tax rate of about 26%, which is lower than our previous expected range of 28% to 30%. This is based on strong year-to-date performance versus our earlier expectations. ", "As we have mentioned before, you should not be surprised to see continued volatility quarter to quarter in our effective tax rate. ", "Finally, it is also challenging to forecast the timing of special items related to the U.S. refranchising program and the U.S. business transformation. For example, it is difficult to pinpoint whether particular refranchising transaction or particular charge will occur in quarter four of this year or quarter one of next year. We have provided our best thoughts on what to expect balance of year in our full-year guidance, which was included in a link to our website in our earnings release last night. ", "Before I wrap up, I would like to talk about our perspective on 2009. Given that commodity inflation is running at levels we\u2019ve not seen in many years, and given that there are concerns about a potential slowdown in the U.S. and global economies, I think it\u2019s especially important to step back and review what makes the Yum! growth model so unique and put the economic concerns into context for our business. ", "Doing so should make all of us shareholders confident in our ability to continue our track record of growth in 2009. Let me explain why. ", "First, we take great pride in our consistent financial performance. We have a track record of six straight years of meeting and exceeding our 10% EPS growth target. We fully expect 2008 to be year seven and our team is very determined to extend this record, given the underlying power of having a global portfolio. ", "Second, unit development is a great foundation for future growth. As the largest international retail developer, we have a consistent track record of delivering over 1,000 international units per year through highly capable teams and franchise partners. At the same time, we have immense future opportunities. As I showed at our May investor conference in Louisville, we have 60 restaurants per million people in our well-developed U.S. business, while in China and YRI we have less than three restaurants per million people. So clearly we have a long runway for growth. ", "For 2008, we are well on our way to match last year\u2019s record development and we have a strong pipeline for 2009. Importantly, our international development generates high returns with primarily franchise development from YRI and strong cash-on-cash returns from China. ", "Third, we believe our brands are well-positioned in all of our businesses. In China, the team has delivered their outstanding track record over the years despite obstacles they have faced. In 2008, as an example, we will meet or exceed our profit targets despite unusually high commodity inflation. We have been able to pass on strategically targeted price increases while maintaining transaction growth. We approach 2009 with confidence as  we expect to leverage our outstanding team, our well-regarded brands in China, and our strategic advantages in development and distribution. ", "At YRI, our business is very geographically diversified and because it is largely franchised, demands little capital and provides relatively predictable revenue. We have strong overall unit development momentum and as you heard from David earlier, we are continuing to make good progress in emerging markets like Russia, India, Brazil, and Vietnam. ", "Given its characteristics, YRI is a highly enviable business and is poised to continue its track record of growth into 2009 and beyond. ", "For the U.S. in 2009, although we don\u2019t know how the economy will play out, we will plan to win assuming the macros will make 2009 another tough year. We are excited about the progress we are making on our major sales growth initiatives and we expect to end 2008 with sales and profit momentum. ", "We expect to bring our A game to deliver value-oriented initiatives and deliver a pipeline of premium products to best manage our menu mix. One clear example of doing this in 2008 with Taco Bell\u2019s simultaneous launch of the why pay more menu and the new premium Fruitista beverage line. In 2009, we will also be diligent in our approach to executing targeted price increases as prices are universally going up in restaurants and grocery stores. ", "Finally, we will manage our costs aggressively and we will proactively reduce our G&A spending for 2009. ", "Yum! overall is a very well capitalized company with a strong balance sheet and significant cash flow. This provides us with the flexibility we need to manage our business and doesn\u2019t inhibit our growth in any way. Therefore, we believe we have the business model to succeed in most environments and that we are very well-positioned to successfully deliver growth in 2009. ", "So to wrap up, we are very pleased with our overall second quarter and first half results. We expect 2008 and 2009 to be successful years as we generate consistent financial performance, impressive global growth, strong free cash flow, and substantial returns to shareholders. ", "Back to you, David.  ", "David C. Novak", "Thanks, Rick. I think that\u2019s a good summary of why [inaudible] stated that Yum! brands in not your ordinary restaurant company. With that, why don\u2019t we open it up for questions and answers and we look forward to talking to you. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Buckley of Banc of America.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "Thank you. I have a couple of questions. Rick, first just to follow-up on your 2009 comments, you talked about growth but I didn\u2019t hear you mention the at least 10% EPS growth. Is that what you are thinking for 2009 at this point or are you trying to signal something else?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Our target remains always at least 10% growth and 2009 is no exception. ", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "Okay, thanks for that clarification. Secondly, just on the second half, I know you talked about YRI and it sounds like the third quarter expectations are lower. You expect fourth quarter sort of back to normal. As I look at last year\u2019s quarters, yeah, third quarter was good but it wasn\u2019t off the charts, in my view. Could you talk a little bit more about why the second half expectations for YRI are slowing, and maybe specifically talk about the U.K., if there\u2019s any issues or implications in the U.K. around that guidance?", "Tim Jerzyk", "First of all, I believe our lap for YRI I believe for last year is I think 14, plus 14 and then I think plus 3 in Q4, so the laps are pretty significantly different, so we wanted to make sure we pointed that out to you. And then also you have the continuing challenge of the elimination of the VAT exemption in Mexico, and if you go back to what Rick said in Q2, that was about an 11 point impact in terms of our year-over-year growth, so if you take that into account, YRI was actually up like 20 points on a constant-currency basis in Q2, which is clearly above their performance. ", "So essentially what we\u2019re talking about for the second half is YRI, we\u2019re just expecting them to get back to what is more so their normal run-rate with the VAT exemption included as a negative factor. ", "And as far as the U.K., we\u2019ve had -- we don\u2019t have any particular factors driving that in terms of the second half. The U.K. overall has been a modest performer for us. Pizza Hut U.K. has been down slightly, which is a continuation of the trends, and KFC U.K. has been slightly positive which is pretty much a continuation of their trends as well. We don\u2019t foresee those trends going forward to change all that much, so it\u2019s a little bit of a slower market for us but not dramatically. ", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Steve West of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Steve West - Stifel Nicolaus", "Just a couple of quick questions on China; when we look at the China margins, I know we\u2019ve got a lot of inflation pressures, we\u2019ve seen margins eroding for the last probably about four or five quarters or so, and now actually accelerating. How confident are you guys in really being able to stabilize or improve the margins as we go forward? It almost seems like we\u2019re in the early stages of the classic growth story, where we have the boom on the top line, margins are going -- and then they start, margins start contracting here. Is this what we are seeing, the early stages of this?", "And then you know, the second question on that is what kind of impact do you think will happen post-Olympics in China? Do you guys anticipate any kind of consumer hangover from that? Thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Why don\u2019t I take the margin question and I\u2019ll also give my perspective on the Olympics, and David may want to chime in after I give those comments. Regarding the margins, there\u2019s only been one issue regarding China margins and that really was the large increase in chicken pricing that occurred late last year. So when that occurred, and it was in the area of over 30% price increase, we had decisions to make on pricing. And what we did in the third quarter is we priced very significant -- it was about a six point, a six percentage point increase in pricing which didn\u2019t cover all of that inflation because we expected prices to come back down. We\u2019ve been fortunate enough that the sales remained terrifically strong through the fourth quarter, first quarter, and second quarter, so that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been able to generate such huge profit increases. So we\u2019ve been able to get the profit increases without having to price all the way through that high chicken cost thing. ", "Now, the chicken prices have been a little sticky. We were hoping they\u2019d come down a little bit quicker. We still expect them to come down somewhat in the fourth quarter this year and obviously if chicken prices stay high, we have shown our ability to price up. So we feel very confident about China margins, Steve, in the long-term. We\u2019re going to end this year with about 20% margins in Mainland China and I see no reason why we should expect that trend to change going forward. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "The other thing I think, Steve, to keep in mind is that what -- you know, obviously there\u2019s global inflation in commodities but there was a significant shock to that market because of the pork situation. That\u2019s the number one protein in that market and there was a significant reduction in the pork supply mid- to late last year because of that blue ear disease. Those are not regular recurring kinds of things and the market is still recovering from that.  ", "David C. Novak", "Regarding the Olympics, for us as a reseller, I never looked at the Olympics as a big event. We\u2019ve got a few hundred units in Beijing and we\u2019ve got 3,000 units by the end of this year in Mainland China in 500 cities, so I never looked at a two-week event as being a big deal to our business. ", "The one thing we have seen on consumer sentiment is we did see a little bit of a pull-back with the earthquake and obviously as David talked about, that was a huge tragedy for the country there, so that\u2019s been the only impact that we\u2019ve seen regarding that, but we still expect in the 2008 to be a great year overall for China, given the great growth rate we\u2019ve seen and as I mentioned before, we expect to end the year with 20% margin. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "And also, just in that same regard to special events, we have the Olympics this year but also if you\u2019re in Shanghai, you know, obviously I think it\u2019s the largest city in China, they are very excited and getting ready for the world event in 2010, so there\u2019s a series of things going on in China and it\u2019s not -- I don\u2019t view it as necessarily just a one-time thing. ", "David C. Novak", "I think we just look at China like we continue to look at China. Nothing\u2019s changed. We just had an unbelievable quarter, one of the best I think anybody could ever expect out of any business. You know, same-store sales up 14% for the group. We had 100 units, 14% same-store sales growth. We\u2019ve got the ability to take price, have taken price. We\u2019re growing same-store sales and new units and transactions. So I think you\u2019ve got a pretty strong business here that we\u2019re in the first inning of a nine-inning ballgame and I think as [we said], we\u2019re going to have ups and downs and deal with certain things certain years, but the good news here is that we\u2019re going to have more KFCs in China than we think McDonald\u2019s has in the U.S. someday if things continue to go how they are going. We\u2019re going to have more casual dining outlets in China with Pizza Hut casual dining than the leading casual dining chain here. We think we\u2019ll have more delivery units longer term. We\u2019re developing East Dawning. ", "You know, I don\u2019t know how anybody could look at what\u2019s going on in our China business without seeing we have one of the greatest retail businesses in the world, period. And that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at it and it\u2019s all full speed ahead and we feel very confident of our 20% profit growth model as we of forward in China and that\u2019s what obviously makes us a very attractive company. There aren\u2019t too many companies that have that kind of business that is basically on the ground floor. ", "And remember, we have two-year cash-on-cash returns on this business and remember a couple of years ago, we had a short-term hit where our sales went down 20% and our margins stayed in that 18% range. Now that was for a six-month period of time, so we\u2019ve got a very well-operated business in a country that is growing like crazy where we have the leading consumer brands in our category. ", "So to me, when you look at our business short-term and long-term, it\u2019s pretty damn good news. ", "Steve West - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. Thank you for the perspective. I appreciate it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much. A question first on commodities, and given that the food commodity environment is likely to stay high for some time, and I think vendors are maybe less likely to enter into longer term contracts, what are you doing to create greater visibility in food costs? Are you able to use financial instruments, for example, or willing to -- are you willing to look for more menu engineering? How can you provide greater visibility for yourselves in the next year on food cost, if there is any way?", "Richard T. Carucci", "To your point, John, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to commodities but we are planning as if they are going to stay high and what we\u2019re going to try to do is just make sure we don\u2019t get behind on it. You know, quite frankly, this year we went into the year assuming it was going to be $55 million. It ended up being $100 million in the U.S. and we got a little bit behind on pricing. We thought we were going to catch most of the [ramp] in Q2. When we talked at the end of the first quarter, we thought commodity inflation was going to be $50 million in the first half of the year, with $25 million in each quarter. It turned out that second quarter alone, we had an extra $5 million in commodity inflation and that was really -- we didn\u2019t have that extra $5 million covered in pricing. ", "As we go forward to the balance of this year and for 2009, we are going to ensure that we have pricing that offsets the commodity inflation, so that\u2019s what we are going to do. We expect the commodity inflation on a per period basis to reduce somewhat in the fourth quarter because we started to see some of the commodity spike occur in the fourth quarter of last year, but we just have to stay on it. And to your point, which we included in the speech, is we are going to have to do all of the above regarding menu mix management. We are still going to have to provide value in these economic times, so you will still initiatives like the why pay more at Taco Bell. But at the same time, we have to launch premium products and handle that menu mix. ", "The one silver lining in the commodity piece is everybody is facing it, so I don\u2019t think anyone is going to really be able to get an advantage in this environment in terms of what products they sell, because pretty much everything is going up across the board. So it\u2019s going to be the people who do the best job of managing new product introductions and value, and those are some of the platforms we\u2019ve been working on since the beginning of this year. ", "So we believe we\u2019ll execute as well as anybody else on those things. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "And then just one other -- in the U.S., the company comps were stronger than the system comps for the first time in a couple of years. So why is that? Is that the mix of the type of businesses that you\u2019ve got, company versus system? Or is that a pricing issue, that you may have exceeded pricing versus franchisees?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I\u2019m not going to read too much into the one point swing. We\u2019ll keep an eye on that to see if there\u2019s a trend there but also, they were outperforming us a year ago so I think it\u2019s probably just more the normal lapping type of arrangement. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and did you quantify the impact of the earthquake in China?", "Tim Jerzyk", "It was a little less than $5 million in terms of identifiable costs. We did not quantify the sales impact of that, particularly the week afterwards. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer of UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "I want to ask you about the U.S. business -- I mean, obviously you want your -- the complexion of your earnings to look different as you head into 2009, something closer to that 3% comp, 5% plus profit growth. And in the first half, I think if we exclude that $18 million insurance gain, the algorithm looked like a 3% comp growth but a 4% profit decline. And if we look at things from a two-year basis, because there\u2019s been such noise in the business, just embracing your guidance for the year, you have kind of a two-year decline of 5% in profit with flat two-year comps. ", "So I guess my question is just what makes this algorithm turn around for you guys, where you can get the comps and get better traction and flow-through, even though it seems like these cost pressures will be sticking around?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, I think I\u2019ll just repeat what I said before, David, is that first of all, obviously we have to continue to get sales. And we\u2019ve talked extensively about that and we are excited about the progress we\u2019re making on sales layers but we have to keep executing quarter in and quarter out on that line. But I think we\u2019re making very good progress. ", "Regarding how we translate that into making more money, I think it comes back to what I said before about we got behind on the pricing versus commodity inflation piece of it, and going forward we\u2019re determined not to get behind. ", "So if we could continue to generate that type of same-store sales growth, the math of getting to 5% works if we could not get behind on the commodity side. So we just got behind on the commodity side this year. ", "David C. Novak", "The only thing I\u2019d add to that, David, is -- I\u2019ve got a real simple answer to this; turn around KFC. I think what\u2019s going on at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, we are extremely excited about. We think we\u2019ve got things moving in the right direction, sales and profits, and we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do at KFC and KFC has taken the [plume] off of what could have otherwise been a very good year, especially that along with commodities have taken the fun out of our U.S. business this year. ", "But in terms of the long-term, we think we\u2019re doing the right things to sustain growth at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and as we said at our conference in -- I think it was in May, that we have more room to cover at KFC and that\u2019s basically what the issue is. We\u2019ve got to turnaround sales and profits at KFC and that\u2019s really the key. We do that and sustain what we\u2019re doing at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut and I think everybody is going to be pretty happy with the progress that we\u2019re making in the U.S. business. ", "So I -- you know, I always say, David, and you know I\u2019ve said this before -- in times like these, anytime in a competitive category, it\u2019s what are you doing to yourself? You know, I mean, if you\u2019ve got great programs, great initiatives in our industry, there\u2019s trade down in this industry where people come to our products because of the value. And if you\u2019ve got good value, great product news, you win. If you have poor value, not great product news, you lose. ", "Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, we\u2019re winning. KFC, we\u2019re losing and there\u2019s nobody to blame for that than us. I wish we had a better commodity situation but I wish we had a hell of a lot more product news and more excitement going on for the customer at KFC right now, and we don\u2019t have it, okay? And when we get it, I think the brand will respond. ", "And our challenge now is to keep it going at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut and get it at KFC, and that\u2019s really what the issue is. You know, everybody in this industry is going to do what they\u2019ve done for the last 50 years, is nobody is going to sit there and watch their margins decline forever without taking price, so everybody is going to have to take price and everybody is going to have to take price as smart as they can take it, and that\u2019s what Rick is talking about in terms of price menu mix management. ", "So we are going to be no different than McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, Papa John\u2019s -- you pick the competitor, everybody is going to have to figure out how to protect their margins because this is all about profit and making money. So that\u2019s going to happen, so what\u2019s really going to make the difference over the longer term is what kind of news and excitement are you bringing to bear, and that\u2019s frankly where I feel very good that we are making the right moves. And I fully admit the proof is in the pudding in the U.S. business. Our last two-year performance looking at what\u2019s going on in the U.S. is not what we want to have happen and we\u2019ve got to bend the curves. ", "Having said that, China, YRI, the growth engines of our business, what really makes us unique is our global business. Those two businesses are humming along and the cash that we generate is humming along. What we\u2019ve got to do to really take a plus 10% consistent business forward and get us to where we\u2019re really happy as a company, okay, is we want to get YRI, China, and the U.S. all humming along together. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on getting done and we\u2019ve got work to do and you did a nice job of laying out the challenge and I appreciate that and I think that everybody -- I hope everybody on the call heard that and I hope you are listening to what we are doing about it. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Jeff Omohundro of Wachovia.", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Thanks. Just one question; I know tax rate visibility, quarterly tax rate visibility is tough but I\u2019m just wondering if you have any directional thoughts on Q3 and Q4 as it relates to the full year guidance? Thank you. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Jeff, no, I\u2019ve made a career out of being wrong whenever I\u2019ve tried to estimate a quarterly tax rate, so we\u2019re just going to stick with our best estimate for the full year of about 26% and if I had to guess a number, I\u2019d probably be wrong. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Since we\u2019ve got this, you know, not such a desirable track record of predicting our tax rate on a quarter in a year, the one thing I did look back on was okay, so if I\u2019m out there looking in, look at the quarterly tax rates and there is some seasonality, if you look at it, okay? And you might want to use that, barring anything else and generally, the first quarter is the -- I think the highest. I think the third quarter is the next highest, and Q2 and Q4 have generally been the lower points in the year. So that\u2019s the only other thing I could tell you, just based on history.

A couple of questions; first just on the U.S., and I think it\u2019s clear versus our estimates, comps came in pretty strong, the restaurant margin is still under pressure. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about your confidence in margins for the full year being only down 1%, and perhaps kind of layer in there, and I know, David, you mentioned focus on great value. I\u2019m just wondering if you can give some early feedback on Taco Bell with the $0.79 to $0.99 and Pizza Hut with the pasta push in terms of perhaps the impact to margins, maybe what\u2019s incremental versus what\u2019s cannibalization, just kind of see how much of the impact from margins is due to the push on value. And then I have a follow-up question. ", "David C. Novak", "Regarding what\u2019s going on in the brand initiatives and how you are protecting margin with that is that people have been taking a balanced view when they\u2019ve introduced these things, so we\u2019ve talked before about the Fruitista Freeze at the same time as the why pay more for Taco Bell. Also the why pay more menu, 90% of the people who come in to buy those items are buying things on the regular menu, so the team sort of knew that as they were putting that together. ", "Similarly on Pizza Hut, which introduced both Pizzones and Mia as value initiatives, we\u2019re able to fund their menu mix by reducing discounting on core pizza items. So teams as they put these plans together are thinking about how it\u2019s going to be profitable, so that\u2019s sort of how we are managing that piece of it. ", "In terms of why the margins -- we don\u2019t expect -- the deterioration of the margins is what we said before, is that we got behind on pricing in the first half of the year and our plan is not to do that in the second half of the year. So I think the menu mix piece, we don\u2019t expect to have a negative impact as they were designed to protect margin. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Also, Jeff, on commodities, based on what we know today, the commodities, kind of on a per period basis, the impact is going to be about the same in Q3 as it was in Q2, but it\u2019s about $10 million a period. But it\u2019s going to be, based on our expectations, more like 6 to 6.5 in Q4, so there is moderation that we expect in Q4 from commodities. ", "And in terms of your question on the initiatives in the product cost and all that, the other thing to keep in mind is Taco Bell, as David mentioned earlier, Taco Bell simultaneously launched a premium product with the beverages with why pay more, and obviously the beverage line that they introduced is definitely a higher margin type of product, so keep that in mind. ", "The other thing is I think from an analytical point of view and the way I look at it is you know, David talked about the initiatives; keep in mind that a fair amount of those initiatives really began to take hold during or towards the end of the quarter and we\u2019re adding to those as the year goes on, so you\u2019re going to get much more of a benefit we think from what\u2019s going on in terms of longer term initiatives in the Q3 and Q4. So there\u2019s a lot more positives going against what\u2019s out there in terms of our pressures and we expect our pressures to moderate in Q4 in terms of commodities. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and just one follow-up question on YRI -- I know it\u2019s -- you highlight it\u2019s primarily franchise. It looks like it\u2019s about 13% company-operated and you\u2019ve got the restaurant margins well below, what appear to be well below the very depressed U.S. levels, kind of in the 10%, 11% range. I was wondering if you could talk about the benefit of ownership as you guys talk about the focus on the right to own, perhaps countries where refranchising might make sense and push that number even higher if the restaurant margins remain challenged. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "As you know, Jeff, we\u2019ve continued to refranchise total markets at YRI and we continue to do that as we speak.  So for example, Pizza Hut in France, we continue to refranchise that market. As we look at how we make decisions on where to own equity, we look at one is scale; second is where are we going to get growth; third is where are we going to get high returns over time. ", "Now, what we\u2019ve been doing is we have been investing in some high growth markets that today don\u2019t give us a lot of margin, places like France and India, which we believe will be very good return markets for us in the long-term. ", "So some of what happens is the margin on the YRI piece is a function of where we are investing. In terms of the margin hit this year, that\u2019s really primarily driven by the VAT piece in Mexico, which has had an impact on margins, as well as what I talked about from a country mix perspective. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Lehman Brothers", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rachael Rothman of Merrill Lynch.", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "A little bit on pricing; can you talk a little bit about how the focus on value in the U.S. may impact your ability or would not impact your ability to take price? Does it change at all your pricing strategy? Does it change your pricing power?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, it\u2019s just -- to your point, Rachael, it\u2019s really just a both game, is that we believe you have to do both, and so that\u2019s why we try to play the menu mix we talked about and introducing premium products at the same time we provide value, which is what we did in the Taco Bell case, or in the Pizza Hut case we did it by reduced discounting is how we were able to provide value. ", "So you have to figure out how to do both and we think that usually works better than just taking across-the-board type price increases, which the consumer feels more. So you just have to do both so it makes it a little harder game to play, but that\u2019s just the environment we\u2019re in right now. ", "David C. Novak", "The other thing, too, we don\u2019t really do this stuff willy-nilly. There\u2019s a lot of learning that we get. For example, we had Pizza Mia, we launched Pizza Mia to get us into the multiple pizza value game. We tested that. We made more money. The pasta, where we have three pounds of pasta for $11.99, that product was engineered so the trade-off versus pizza was minimal and we tested it and we made more money. We tested the $0.79, $0.89, $0.99 menu and we made more money. ", "And I think what\u2019s more important than the product, the margin economics by product is what\u2019s happening to your overall concept. Is the value of your overall concept and the penny profit that you ultimately bring in, and all of our franchisees look at cash. They like making more money. So you can have a little bit of margin degradation as long as you are making more cash, and we\u2019re trying obviously not to have any margin degradation and bring in more money. That\u2019s the ultimate challenge here, but we feel that all of our concepts are better off today because of the moves that we\u2019ve made and we\u2019ve done an excellent job at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell managing the mix and the profitability by item. I think the thing that is challenging us at KFC is that we don\u2019t have that as well-managed as we need to have managed, and we don\u2019t have the news to go along with it and I think as a result of that, we\u2019ve been hit on the bottom line there and we\u2019re hell-bent on doing better. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Great, and then can you just talk about how the weakness at KFC U.S. may be impacting the franchisee remodel plans and whether or not you guys are offering incentives to the franchisees to remodel and whether that will lead to greater-than-expected closures? I think you\u2019d originally targeted maybe 200 to 300. ", "David C. Novak", "Well, effectively the remodeling plan is complete. There\u2019s a few exceptions that are occurring and if anything, we may do a little better on the closures than what we originally thought, so no impact there. That was really a lot of work that had been done over the last several years. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "And we\u2019re not providing any incentives. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Great, and then just finally, could you remind me, the price increases in China last year, was the price increase predominantly in the third quarter or the fourth quarter? And I believe you had said it was about 10 percentage points -- is that correct?", "Richard T. Carucci", "No, it was around a -- it was in July of last year that we took about a 6% price increase and then earlier this year, we took about a 2% price increase. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "So as we speak, basically, the only ongoing -- the current run-rate on pricing is about -- a little over 2%. That 6-plus from last year July just rolled off. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and in terms of your outlook for pricing in China in the back half of the year, do you feel like you still have capacity to take more price?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We probably have capacity. We\u2019re still judging what we think is going to happen with chicken costs. So we\u2019re going to look at the whole equation and obviously the team, because they\u2019ve had such great sales results, has had the luxury of sort of waiting it out. ", "Rachael Rothman - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you so much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Miller with RBC Capital Markets.", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets ", "My question was just asked and answered. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kron of Goldman Sachs. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Great, thanks a lot. I have a couple of questions; just going back to the U.S., there\u2019s obviously a lot of focus on the business right now and I want to just go back to the margins for a second and we\u2019ve talked about the commodity side of things. At the restaurant, company restaurant level, it seems as though there was incremental pressure or pressure that accelerated on the payroll line and the occupancy line. Now the occupancy line might be where that insurance on a year-over-year basis is hidden, but either way can you maybe just talk a little bit about the trends that you are seeing on those two lines?", "And then related to that, I guess as you think about the brands -- or can you talk a little bit about the drag maybe that KFC had on that restaurant margin line? Or asked another way, if you don\u2019t want to get that specific, is if you combine Taco Bell and Pizza Hut at this point on a combined margin basis for those businesses that seemingly did pretty well, are those restaurant margins positive on a year-over-year basis?", "Tim Jerzyk", "First let me answer your question on the labor piece because on the insurance that we called out on the year-over-year lap issue that we called out on the U.S., that was split between labor and occupancy and other. So there was -- basically one\u2019s workers\u2019 comp, which goes into labor; the other one is mostly general liability, which goes into other occupancy. ", "So that labor piece that you saw was due to the year-over-year insurance impact from workers\u2019 comp. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So if I add that back last year, I think company restaurant margins were down about a percent. So I guess to the second question, I mean, how much of a drag was KFC in fact on that percent, and are the other two brands contributing positively to that line?", "Tim Jerzyk", "I\u2019ll let Rick get into further detail but we\u2019re not going to disclose by brand margin impact but obviously from what we\u2019ve said and what we put in the release, you\u2019re going to have negative operating leverage from KFC because their sales were down and you are going to have positive leverage from the other two because their sales were up. So you definitely had that impact within the overall margin picture in the U.S. just because of that. They were all impacted by the insurance lapse and they were all impacted actually pretty equally on the commodities. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "As Tim said, we\u2019re not going to get into specifics but one thing, I don\u2019t think anyone is having a lot of joy right now in the U.S. regarding increasing margins. But I think it would be fair to say most of the decline was driven by KFC. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then a follow-up on YRI, Rick; I\u2019m still just a little confused on the back half guidance. Year-to-date, the profit growth has been 18% and I thought in your comments, you said third quarter would be below the first half performance which, understandably so with a plus 18, but your full year guidance is plus 11, so that\u2019s like considerably low because I think you are signaling third quarter will be weaker than fourth quarter. So from a degree of magnitude, were you suggesting that the third quarter will be below the first half as you indicated, or are we really to expect that this profitability is going to essentially flat line or just be slightly positive on a year-over-year basis? I\u2019m just trying to make sure I understand that subtlety. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, in terms of the third quarter, we don\u2019t expect -- we expect a fairly flattish kind of number and then we expect, as Tim said earlier, we expect a normal type of number in the fourth quarter, and again we\u2019re getting hit overall for the full year, both first half and second half by the VAT. So again, you\u2019re going to see sort of flattish type numbers in the third quarter and then a more normal number in the fourth quarter. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks for that. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks. I just wanted to understand some of the opportunities to cut G&A in 2009. I mean, for as long as you\u2019ve been a public company, it seems that G&A cost controls and spending the right way has been part of your mantra, so I just want to see what additional opportunity may be \u201908 and \u201909, and if there was anything structural there. ", "And then secondly, and I\u2019m sorry if you said this, could you give a CapEx number for 2009?", "Tim Jerzyk", "We have not yet for 2009. We\u2019ll have to get you that probably later in the year. We\u2019re at about 800 for the year right now. Most of that for this year, most of that is -- you are seeing increases in development in China and also at YRI, we are investing some money in the Pizza Hut U.K. business on the casual dining side of that, and we\u2019re going to have to take a look and see what we are going to expect, primarily more so on the U.S. side for next year but in terms of mix, you are going to see the U.S. probably go down in CapEx requirement next year, but probably a little bit of upside pressure in terms of China and YRI. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Is it -- ", "Tim Jerzyk", "I\u2019d use 800 as at least a starting point. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Sorry, and on the G&A side, we haven\u2019t come up with a detailed plan yet on our approach but what we\u2019ve said historically is as we refranchise that there\u2019s a lag between taking the G&A out and the refranchising restaurants. We\u2019ll probably push the edge of that envelope a little harder than what we have historically. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "And would most of it therefore come out of the U.S. in unallocated, or is there opportunity to begin to see it more on the YRI side as well?", "Richard T. Carucci", "You\u2019ll see it on the -- most likely on the U.S. side and the Yum! side. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "And YRI? Or I mean for Yum!, you mean corporate?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yum! Corporate. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. All right. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West of Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "I was wondering if you guys are still planning to -- I think you talked about buy-backs of about $4 billion of stock over \u201908 and \u201909. I just want to see if that\u2019s still what you are thinking and if you\u2019d be willing to raise some debt to make that happen. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "We are fully committed and full expect to meet our commitment for the year, which is returning at least $2 billion to shareholders through dividends and buy-back. You know, the thing that I think for us as we felt coming into the year that there would be a fair amount of volatility in the market, so we would be more opportunistic this year. And obviously also we have to be mindful of our liquidity, so we fully expect to meet that commitment. ", "As far as debt, we just added a $375 million term loan to our debt profile. There is a possibility that we may go to the market the balance of the year. We\u2019re basically, just to put it a little bit in perspective, we\u2019re continuing to progress with the execution of what we announced last October with basically a [mini-recap]. We added $1.2 billion in bonds, [10 and third-year] bonds last October. We just added the $375 million three-year term loan. We\u2019re going to be just as we are with shareholder repurchases, being opportunistic. We\u2019re going to be opportunistic with the timing and how we access the capital markets. ", "So again, depending on the conditions in the market, which as you know have been very volatile. We may or may not -- we\u2019re going to make sure we do it the right way, so we\u2019ll be patient. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Mitch Speiser of Buckingham Research.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Thanks very much. A few questions; first, I noticed you didn\u2019t buy back any stock in the second quarter. Any particular reason for that?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, basically we just said, Mitch, we\u2019re going to be opportunistic and we\u2019re going to also be mindful and keep in mind when we bought back $1 billion in the first quarter, that put us way ahead of our plan and that was basically because the market gave us a huge opportunity to add a lot of shareholder value with the buy-back, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. But we\u2019ll make our commitment of $2 billion in buy-back and dividend for the year for sure. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Okay, thanks. And in the U.S., that 4% comp for company-operated, could you break out the pricing traffic mix for us?", "Tim Jerzyk", "It was all essentially -- it was driven by mix and pricing at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Okay, is that -- ", "Tim Jerzyk", "There will be more details in the Q but basically it was not transaction driven for the quarter. It was pricing and menu mix driven. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Okay. If I could ask when the value menu was introduced at Taco Bell, did that swing traffic positive at Taco Bell from that point, or -- ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, it did. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And in China in the first quarter you did break out the pricing and mix. Can you do that for us for the second quarter?", "Tim Jerzyk", "I don\u2019t know the mix part but the pricing piece was roughly about eight to nine, which as we said -- you know, that will drop off based on where we are right now considerably in Q3 but about eight to nine of pure pricing and I\u2019m not sure about the menu mix piece. We\u2019ll have that in the Q. Transactions were also -- were positive. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Got it. And my last question, just on that $100 million in incremental commodity costs in the U.S., the incremental 50 was the first half and that\u2019s behind us now, but what visibility do you have on that? Is there any risk that that might go higher? Or do you think you are pretty much fully loading all I guess risks into that $100 million number?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Well, we thought we did with the last estimate last quarter, I think was 82. The biggest swing factor pretty much always for us, especially when you\u2019re earlier in the year, is going to be cheese. We generally, throughout a number of different methods, kind of lock in about 30% to 40% of our usage in a given year. Chicken is usually pretty well locked through contracts, so when the two big items that will affect us, cheese and chicken, cheese is where we are most exposed and it\u2019s because we really can\u2019t lock in much beyond that 30% to 40%. So if there\u2019s volatility beyond what we expect in cheese, that\u2019s what will drive positive or negative on commodities. So that would be still our primary remaining exposure, depending on if cheese goes one way or the other. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Got it. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Joe Buckley of Banc of America.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America ", "I\u2019m set. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We actually have time for one more question. Your final question is a follow-up from the line of David Palmer of UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks. Where are you seeing slowing, if at all, in your International business, or is momentum in the last quarter and even intra-quarter really remaining fairly stable?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Well, I think as David mentioned in his remarks, opening remarks, the franchise business units were all solidly positive. I mean, we can go back and read through those but they were all I believe at least seven points of growth to as high as in the 20s in the Middle East. ", "In terms of softness, I think we remarked the last quarter that Japan and Canada were probably -- and the Korea Pizza Hut business were our softest spots, and that\u2019s pretty much still the case in Q2. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "So in terms of momentum or sequential changes in growth rates, is there anything that you could call out as being different that would feel like it\u2019s more than just you had a particularly good or bad promotion that feels a little bit more macro?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, I think part of what we\u2019re -- on the international side, the markets that we just talked about and earlier, a couple of them had a particularly good Q3 last year. Sequentially, there\u2019s not any -- really any change but we are lapping a pretty strong performance at Pizza Hut U.K. and Pizza Hut Korea last year Q3. Other than that, and from a sequential basis, no. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "I\u2019d say the one macro thing, David, that\u2019s out there, I don\u2019t know it\u2019s specific to our business but developing countries, the economies that continue to do well, you\u2019re seeing -- there\u2019s been general softness that\u2019s Tim pointed [inaudible] stepped up, but you\u2019ve seen general softness in some of the more developed markets, like Canada, the U.K., those developed economies. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "And let me just reread what David said earlier, because these are very impressive numbers. The Middle East was up 27%, South Africa was up 19, Europe up 16, the Caribbean/Latin America up 15, and Asia up 7 -- those are all constant currency system sales growth numbers. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "I ask these questions because Coke was reporting some numbers just this morning and they had some slowdown, at least -- you know, and it\u2019s arguable that they are because of tough comparisons but in some markets in the Eastern Europe and Brazil, their growth rates were not quite as strong as they had been, and so that\u2019s generally trying to probe into whether there would be cracks in the international consumer front, even in emerging markets. That\u2019s why I asked. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "We haven\u2019t seen any and those are obviously -- for us, those are not big markets. ", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thank you. ", "David C. Novak", "Okay, well, just let me wrap it up. I think stepping back and looking at the entire Yum! story, it remains remarkably consistent. Nothing has really changed from what we\u2019ve been talking about in the past year, past few years, as a matter of fact. Our global business is strong, with the second quarter EPS growth of 16% excluding special items and year-to-date growth of 17%. ", "Second, the confidence we have in the business allows us to raise our 2008 earnings per share forecast to $1.89, or 12% growth, excluding special items, which once again reaffirms our annual commitment to deliver EPS of at least 10% year after year and in fact, we\u2019re going to exceed it one more time. ", "Third, each of our businesses continue to generate free cash flow, giving us the global capability to return over $2 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And as Tim said, we\u2019re well on our way to doing that. And fourth, we\u2019re already preparing for 2009 to do it again. We\u2019ve got an extreme focus on maintaining our pace of development, rolling out the differentiated products and sales layers that I\u2019ve been talking about the value options, and we are fully aware of the challenges associated with managing food inflation and we\u2019re dealing with that through the smart kind of pricing and the kind of G&A management you\u2019d expect from any well-managed company and hopefully we want to be in that camp. ", "So with all these things underway, in spite of the macros and in spite of all the challenges that people see out there, we believe that we will continue to achieve our EPS growth commitment of at least 10% in 2009 as we go forward and beyond. ", "You know, like I said, I don\u2019t know of any retailer who has a better longer term impact or ability to impact the three things that drive share price in the retail category. You know, same-store sales growth obviously with all the sales layers that we are working on and the fact that our asset base is clearly under-leveraged in terms of use throughout the day and also in terms of the variety that we offer. ", "New unit development -- there\u2019s no retailer in the world that\u2019s developing more new units outside the United States than Yum! Brands, and we are doing that now with three brands, admittedly Taco Bell is just getting started there. And then return on invested capital, top tier, you know, arguably the highest in our industry. So we\u2019ve got all those working for us. Those are the long-term factors that make us a great investment and have all of us in Yum! excited about the future. ", "So frankly, if you go back and you listen to any call we\u2019ve had in the last five years, you know, this is kind of our story, we\u2019re sticking to it and we\u2019ve just got to execute and stay after the things that are clearly opportunities for us as we go forward. ", "So really appreciate the call, the spirit of the questions. I hope we answered the questions that you had and go back to running the business and delivering the goods. Talk to you later.

", "In addition, we would like you to be aware that our next earnings date will be Wednesday, April 22, which would include first quarter earnings release.", "On our call today you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. Now I would like to turn the call over to David Novak.", "David C. Novak", "Good morning everyone. I am very pleased to report 14% EPS growth for the full year 2008, which once again exceeds our annual target of at least 10% growth and represents our seventh straight year of at least 13% growth. Our China and YRI Divisions, which now account for 60% of operating profit are a major factor in driving this consistency of performance.", "2008 was no exception as we opened a record 1,495 new restaurants outside the United States, generated worldwide same-store-sales growth of 3% and worldwide operating-profit growth of 8%. Importantly, our return on invested capital improved by roughly one point to an all-time high of 20%.", "For the first quarter our operating-profit growth was an impressive 17% in an environment of declining economic trends, particularly in the United States. We generated worldwide system-sales growth of 6%, excluding foreign currency translation with strong international new-unit development and worldwide same-store-sales growth of 3%.", "Looking at China, our business continued to perform well. Unit development is on track with a strong 18% new-unit growth in mainland China, which surpassed the 3,000 unit mark while also achieving same-store-sales growth of 1% resulting in division operating-profit growth of 18%.", "It is important to note in the first quarter we were lapping extraordinarily year-ago results, including mainland China same-store-sales growth of 17% and division operating-profit growth of 44%, the best quarterly performance in the division\u2019s history, which makes China\u2019s first quarter performance even more impressive.", "In December, applies-to-apples, we were down 1% same-store-sales growth on top of 23% versus year-ago. I don\u2019t know of one business that wouldn\u2019t be happy with that, especially given our rapid expansion. Our China business remains the best restaurant opportunity in the world.", "Next, our YRI business continues to produce strong results with the first quarter capping off a year with record new-unit development of 924 units for the year and strong same-store-sales growth of 5% in the quarter, which was one point better than the third quarter, resulting in 8% operating-profit growth in local currency terms.", "Finally, we were also pleased with our U.S. business which generated same-store-sales growth of 2%, the sixth straight quarter of positive growth, improved margins by nearly two points, and operating-profit growth of 7% in the first quarter.", "So 2008 clearly ended well. Let me now give you my perspective on the overall business as we look forward to 2009. First, let me point out that the fundamentals that have driven seven straight years of at least 13% EPS growth are still solidly in place for Yum! Brands. ", "We are on the ground floor of a huge long-term growth opportunity in China, we have ever-increasing growth opportunities in YRI, and finally, our U.S. business, an area of our company that has underperformed in the past, is set up for much-improved performance in the future as we have made tremendous progress on building new incremental sales layers that better leverage our assets and have substantially reduced our U.S. G&A costs by $60.0 million, or an 11% reduction.", "At the same time we face the short-term reality in the global economy that will make 2009 a very challenging year. As we showed you in our New York Investor Update Meeting in December, we are sharpening our value offerings and continuing to expand our new incremental sales layers to succeed in this environment.", "Now let me address three questions that we are hearing from our investors. First, can our China business continue to grow at a strong rate if the economy continues to slow down? Now, there is no question the China economy has slowed down. However, it is still the fastest-growing major economy in the world. Now while we\u2019re not economists, here are some key points worth mentioning. ", "The recent slowdown has been driven more by the decline in exports versus a change in consumer spending, which now makes up a large component of China\u2019s GDP growth. While there are a number of statistics and reports circulating, we watch retail sales that were still up 19% in December, down from 23+% midyear, and while some predict China retail sales will see low double-digit growth by mid-2009, there is a huge stimulus package with spending already underway on infrastructure projects.", "Like I said, we are not economists and we certainly recognize that the China economy is not booming as it once was, but solid growth continues and the slowdown may not be as severe as some reports predict. In any scenario, our brands are well positioned to perform.", "Looking at our overall business in China, our pricing has always been expensive when the average income for the total population is considered. However, the middle class, our typical consumer, continues to grow in size, along with their incomes. So our average guest check at KFC of around $4 and our average guest check at Pizza Hut at around $20 are more accessible to more consumers today than they were a year ago.", "Still, we expect consumer sentiment to be down, along with the GDP growth rate, which is why we reduced our operating-profit growth target from our ongoing 20% target in China to a range of 15% to 20%. ", "Remember, our development pace, currently an 18% growth rate, includes new units already in the ground and should generate approximately three-quarters of China\u2019s operating-profit growth target for 2009. The rest should come from more modest same-store-sales growth of around 5% and G&A leverage.", "Longer term, we have significant competitive advantages, which are very much to our benefit and our China self-funds our high-return new-unit growth so we can keep the pedal to the metal to fulfill long-term demand. Let\u2019s not lose sight of this country\u2019s great long-term potential with 1.3 billion people and a huge middle-class population of roughly 300.0 million people today.", "Bottom line, the macros of 6% GDP growth obviously are as good as double-digit growth that we saw in the past, but it\u2019s still the fastest growing major economy in the world. We think we can continue to build leading brands in every significant category. In the end, we continue to believe that our China business will have more units and generate more profits than our U.S. business one day.", "While the near term is more challenging we sure are glad that we are in China with such a great team operating such great brands and we expect that we will improve our competitive position and grow profits by 15% to 20% in 2009.", "Next question. Is the global economic slowdown going to impact YRI\u2019s growth? Here again, YRI\u2019s results in the first quarter were strong, including significant development of 404 new units in the quarter and same-store-sales growth of 5%, which as one point better than the third quarter. The good news is that we are on forecast as we start the year. ", "Remember, new-unit development, marginally driven by our franchisees generates about half of YRI\u2019s operating-profit growth target of 10% and we have 924 new units from 2008 in the ground and 900 more planned for 2009. The balance of YRI\u2019s operating profit growth should come from same-store-sales growth of 3% to 5% and leverage on our existing G&A structure.", "As you would expect, like all business, there is some nervousness in our franchise community about the credit markets but we haven\u2019t seen noteworthy impacts to our franchise new-unit development plans to date. And just like China, our long-term competitive advantage is huge given the fact that we only have one major competitor in many international markets and in this environment there will be fewer and fewer companies attempting to become international.", "So YRI has held up remarkably well in this challenging global economic environment. We are confident we will be able to deliver our target of 10% profit growth in 2009 prior to significant headwinds from foreign currency translation that will be reflected in our reported results.", "Now the last question. Will the U.S. continue to be a drag on Yum! earnings? Here\u2019s where we are more pleased than ever that we got ahead of the sales challenges almost everyone in our industry faces. We took actions to reduce our G&A cost structure for the long term and strategically we are sharpening our value positions and developing major new sales layers with each brand which will drive long-term asset utilization. So there is no question that we are focused on the right fundamentals that should drive profitability.", "On the cost side, we have taken actions to reduce $60.0 million of G&A expenses, or an 11% reduction, which will alone drive nine points of profit growth for the U.S. business. ", "With respect to our brands, first Taco Bell is a Mexican-inspired powerhouse brand that owns the value position in the QSR category and is positioned to do well in this environment. And remember, Taco Bell now represents 60% of the United States\u2019 profits. Our new sales layers with the Why Pay More value menu and Fruitista Freeze continue to perform well and we have lots of news planned for the year.", "We see our biggest challenge to be Pizza Hut and KFC, which are off to a slower start that we had expected because these brands focus on the higher-ticket dinner occasion, which is under the most pressure due to customers doing more cooking at home. The good news is is that we haven\u2019t yet launched our big marketing guns and we don\u2019t expect one month of the year to predict our full year performance. It\u2019s just too early to draw any conclusions.", "For example, Pizza Hut just launched lasagna, which tested well in this environment and has generated excellent consumer response. Wing Street also continues to grow, ending the year with 2,063 units in the ground, as we move towards the 3,000 unit level, which allow for national advertising of Wing Street wings at Pizza Hut later this year. We are more confident than ever that our quality pasta and award-winning chicken wings will totally transform the Pizza Hut brand over time.", "KFC clearly has the most ground to cover and our January sales were extremely poor. However, we just went on air with our freshness campaign, highlighting our quality and featuring a $3 per person meal promotion. The fresh message drove positive results in Australia and test markets here in the U.S. Next week we will be launching our first ever nationwide and nationally advertised value menu and in April we will launch the successfully tested Kentucky Grilled Chicken. ", "As you know, KFC was our only underperforming business in 2008 and we have a lot of wood yet to chop. But given all we have planned, we are confident our performance will start to steadily improve beginning in the second quarter.", "So bottom line, it is early and while our plans are definitely back-end loaded, we expect our U.S. business will achieve about 15% profit growth.", "Finally, I would like to remind you that we have a remarkably strong free cash flow and a balance sheet which allows us to continue our dividend program and gives us the freedom from any dependence on the credit markets in 2009.", "Let me wrap up by saying we continue to expect that the strength of our global portfolio will once again allow us to deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2009 which will represent our eighth straight year of double-digit growth. Looking at the long term, I am more optimistic than ever about our growth opportunities.", "So now let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Carucci, to give you the financial update.", "Richard T. Carucci", "In this section of the call I\u2019m going to comment on three items: our 2008 full year results; our 2008 fourth quarter results; and our outlook for 2009.", "Starting with our full year results I would like to highlight Yum!\u2019s progress regarding three key drivers of shareholder value: same-store-sales growth; new-unit growth; and high return on invested capital.", "First, worldwide same-store-sales growth of 3% in 2008 is the best full year result since spin-off and marks the eighth straight year of worldwide same-store-sales growth.", "Second, we continue to expand our business around the world, opening a record 1,495 new international restaurants. This equates to opening more than four new restaurants per day outside the U.S. and exceeds the 2007 level by more than 125 new units.", "And third, Yum! improved its return on invested capital in 2008 to 20%, marking the fifth straight year Yum! has increased its ROIC. Yum! continues to be an industry leader in generating returns on invested capital.", "We are very proud of our track record of achieving global growth while also demonstrating financial discipline. We believe that this combination allows Yum! to consistently drive shareholder value for our investors.", "Now let\u2019s move into the fourth quarter results. In the fourth quarter of 2008 the China Division delivered system-sales growth of 15%, excluding foreign currency translation. This growth as driven largely by mainland China net unit growth of 18% and mainland China same-store-sales growth of 1%. ", "Fourth quarter margins were down 1.5 points primarily due to continued high commodity inflation. This resulted in fourth quarter operating-profit growth of 8% prior to FX translation.", "When looking at China Division\u2019s fourth quarter results it is important to take into account the truly exceptional results achieved in 2007. As David just mentioned, we lapped the best quarter in the division\u2019s history. In fact, during last year\u2019s call at this time I commented upon how special those results were. I mentioned that the mainland China same-store-sales growth of 17% in Q4 of 2007 was unexpected, especially in light of achieving net unit growth of 21%.", "Given the strong results we were lapping in the second half of 2007, it makes sense to look at two-year growth rates to gain a greater understanding of China trends. When examining two-year trends for the China Division\u2019s system-sales growth you will find that fourth quarter growth was 49%, just three points below the first half\u2019s strong results, an improvement of four points over the third quarter.", "Yum! Restaurants International posted solid results in the fourth quarter. YRI generated strong top line performance with 5% same-store-sales growth and 5% net-unit growth. This generated systems-sales growth of 9%, which is actually slightly above our full year growth rate.", "Profits were up 8% on a constant currency basis. Importantly, YRI\u2019s fourth quarter results are more impressive when you consider the loss of a valued-added tax exemption in our Mexico business. Excluding the impact of the VAT, YRI profits were up 16% on a constant currency basis.", "It is important to note that YRI\u2019s reported fourth quarter operating profit was negatively impacted by $13.0 million due to foreign currency translation, or ten points of growth.", "Our established presence in numerous growing markets, together with our franchise business model, make YRI a crucial part of Yum!\u2019s overall growth story and we are pleased that this business maintained momentum in the fourth quarter.", "For the fourth quarter, U.S. system same-store-sales growth of 2% was driven by strong performance of Taco Bell of 9%, partially offset by Pizza Hut which was down 1% and KFC which was down 3%.", "While commodity inflation remained relatively high at $32.0 million, cumulative pricing actions finally caught up to this inflation and facilitated fourth quarter restaurant margin improvement of almost 200 basis points.", "Solid sales growth and improved restaurant margins led to profit growth of 7% for the quarter. This was driven by strong profit results during the quarter at Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, capping strong overall results for these brands in 2008 as their sales growth initiatives gained traction with consumers.", "On the financial side, Yum!\u2019s fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by a higher effective tax rate and increased interest expense, partially offset by a reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. These negative financial impacts were more than offset by a $33.0 million reduction in corporate and unallocated G&A expense when excluding special items.", "This reduction was due to the lapping of higher annual incentive compensation and strategic project timing in the fourth quarter of 2007 and accounted for ten points of the 17% operating profit growth in the fourth quarter.", "Now I would like to talk about 2009. In the December Investor Meeting we gave a pretty thorough review of our expectations for 2009. Today I will provide some perspective on how our early results coincide with that outlook.", "First let me make a comment about the first quarter. Let\u2019s remember that our plan for growth in 2009 was significantly back-end loaded. As mentioned in the release last night, a number of items that will impact our overall 2009 growth have a disproportionate impact on our first quarter results. ", "Please note, one the majority of full year commodity inflation is expected to occur in the first quarter. Two, the financial benefits of the G&A restructuring announced in the fourth quarter will not be fully realized until the second quarter. Three, KFC in the U.S. does not expect significant improvement until the launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken in the second quarter. And four, China is lapping exceptionally strong performance in the first half of 2009.", "We are still early in 2009 but please keep in mind that we have not changed our full year expectations for profit growth for our key segments or for Yum! overall.", "I will now discuss how sales are coinciding with our December expectations. Let\u2019s start with China. Given the timing of the Chinese New Year and other factors, it is very difficult to get a read on China\u2019s sales performance right now, however, I would best categorize the actual sales since our December meeting as roughly in line, to slightly below our expectations.", "Our brands have distanced themselves from competition and are stronger than ever as we remain extremely confident of our China business model. Our competitive position continues to improve. KFC ended 2008 with about a 1,500 unit advantage versus our nearest competitor. This lead was only about 225 units in 2002. In addition, our new KFC stores throughout the country continued to perform well with cash margins of nearly 25% and projected internal rates of return of about 30%.", "We view the current slowdown in the Chinese economy as only a short-term issue. We do not know exactly how the Chinese consumer will react during the next several months to the economic slowdown. However, we are not changing our approach to new unit investment or other long-term decisions.", "With 3,000 restaurants today, Yum! only has about two restaurants per million people in China versus 60 restaurants per million people in the U.S. this continues to create a substantial opportunity. We expect the Chinese middle class to continue to grow at a rapid rate as the economy continues to grow.", "The World Bank forecast that the Chinese middle and upper classes will grow at about 9% annually through 2030 and reach 900.0 million. While this growth may get bumpy at times and may not remain as smooth as in the recent past, we are still in the early stages of penetrating this massive market of 1.3 billion people.", "With our improving competitive position, great new-unit returns, and a rapidly growing middle class, we will continue to build units at a rapid pace in China.", "Let\u2019s briefly turn to YRI. As I mentioned earlier, sales continued to perform well in the fourth quarter of 2008. These strong results were posted across a broad geographic range, as shown in the new chart in the earnings release. So far in fiscal 2009 we have seen sales broadly in line with both recent trends and our December expectations.", "The biggest unknown for YRI in 2009 remains the impact of foreign exchange. In December we expected a negative $80.0 million impact on YRI\u2019s full year reported profits. We currently expect about a $25.0 million negative impact in the first quarter. Overall, we remain quite pleased with the competitive position and prospects of our YRI business.", "For the U.S. business in 2009, we previously communicated that we expected profit growth of 15%. This is driven largely by G&A cost savings that will make up about 9 points of the growth. David has already commented that U.S. sales started the year below our expectations, especially in the higher ticket dinner occasion.", "In the U.S. our current expectations versus December also include the following: lower than expected sales in the first quarter; a tougher overall environment for sales in 2009; and better commodity costs, especially in the second half of the year.", "So how does this all add up? When we met in December we did provide most of the pieces that would impact our Q1 results. This translated into a mid-single-digit decrease in Q1 2009 year-over-year operating profits. From where we sit today there are probably more potential downsides than upsides to this Q1 operating profit scenario. ", "On a full year basis, we have not changed our outlook. We expect to build our consistent track record in 2009 and achieve at least 10% EPS growth. ", "We have a strong balance sheet and substantial cash flow, which help provide tremendous stability. We believe we have a business model that allows us to be a company that will deliver global growth in today\u2019s environment while also building for the future.", "We look forward to generating substantial shareholder value by maintaining a passionate focus on generating same-store-sales growth, new-unit development, and industry-leading ROIC.", "Back to you David.", "David C. Novak", "I want to thank our team around the world for the results we generated in 2008. We are really proud of the results, the fact that we delivered 14% EPS growth. We are even prouder of the fact that we have exceeded our 10% earnings per share target for the past seven years, one of the very few companies that have done that. And finally, we expect to deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2009. We are proud of our track record and we intend on keeping it.", "So with that, what we would like to do is take any questions that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Palmer \u2013 UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "With regard to your outlook, you said there were these sort of pistons to your earnings, where you had the consumer might be weak but commodities may also be weak in that sort of an environment. And it seems like dairy has come off a good bit since the outlook but it also seems like for many, many companies, even in the consumer products world within food retailing, that December and January for the consumer was a different thing than it was before. That said dairy has been much better than you would have thought as well. Maybe there is also something to the fact that chicken prices in China, for instance, might be coming off and inflation in general in that market may be better than it once was. So could you wrap that up, talk about those different levers and to what degree does one offset the other?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I will try to do this a bit by division and then come back to the total because you\u2019re going to see similarities.", "If you see YRI, we have basically seen ourselves hold up pretty much consistent with the levels we had before December and January, so we have been encouraged by that. We do expect some reduction in commodity costs in the second half of the year versus where we were before, but yes, I think it is likely in most places around the world that there will be some correlation between sales and commodity growth. If there is weaker demand you expect there to be a weaker demand for commodities and therefore lower prices.", "In China, we sort of talked about what happened to the sales. David went through that in some depth. Sales are sort of hanging in versus what we were expecting. Maybe a little bit down, depending on the week we\u2019re talking about. Again, we expected commodity inflation to be higher in the first half of the year. We see that still being the case. In fact, we probably see the second half of the year looking better in China as well as where we were in December at the analysts meeting.", "And then the U.S., same story. We probably saw a little bigger decline in sales than we expected in the second half of January versus where we were at the December time frame but we also have seen commodity costs getting better, significantly better in the second half of the year is our guess at this time.", "Obviously very fluid. It\u2019s fairly hard to predict in this environment but I do believe that if we get sales softness we will likely get commodity upside.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "A question on China and your infrastructure build in that country. Obviously the fourth quarter G&A was only up a couple of million dollars and in constant currency, if you\u2019re seeing that it affected G&A the same as it did your operating profit, it may have actually been down in dollars in the fourth quarter. Is China in a position now where you can begin to leverage the last couple of years of infrastructure growth or is the unit growth that you are still pursuing in the market dictate that your G&A still grows roughly as a percentage, or slightly less than a percentage, of sales?", "David C. Novak", "If you look at what\u2019s happened historically in China with G&A and revenue growth, they\u2019ve been roughly traveling at the same rate, if you go back over a five-year period. What we could have said about six months or a year ago, is we do believe we should start to get some leverage on the G&A line. We are still going to be growing G&A in real terms in China but it should be at a rate that is below our rate of revenue and therefore we do expect some leverage on the G&A line. Not huge amounts but it should help our business model over the next several year periods.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "One of your competitors talked about pulling back some of the tier-4 or tier-5, or smaller tier markets, in China based on the fact that returns aren\u2019t there today relative to what they may have been six to twelve months ago. Can you comment on how important those markets are to you, whether you are seeing that similar kind of trend, whether you are changing your development in China to perhaps try to pursue some lower-risk opportunities, especially in a slowing cycle?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Obviously we spend a huge amount of time looking at our China business returns of both brands by all sizes of cities by all regions. One of the things that is really great about our China business is our performance has really been outstanding on new-unit development returns, throughout the country.", "Having said that, probably for us, even better in the lower-tier cities. Or at least as good. And so what we have seen is actually by now half of our units are in tier-3 to tier-6 cities. Those units continue to perform at a very strong rate for us so we are not changing anything along those lines. So overall, KFC projected IRRs continue to do great. ", "But just to give you an idea of how we do look at this in depth by brand, what we have done is we have slowed down development of Pizza Hut dine-in in tier-1 cities where we have had a lot of expansion recently in that brand and we were seeing results that were good overall but not as good as the rest of our portfolio. So we have decided to slowdown in that area. But that\u2019s just an example of how we look at this stuff all the time and we have had great results in these lower-tier cities.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Omohundro \u2013 Wachovia.", "Jeff Omohundro - Wachovia", "Another question on China development. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the new store opening performance over the last six months in terms of average sales. And when looking at the full year profit growth at 15% to 20%, what kind of targets are you thinking about in terms of new store performance?", "Richard T. Carucci", "For China Division we opened up 500 units in 2008. Our plans are for high growth again in 2009. Again, across all tier cities. The performance the last six months has continued to be strong. That\u2019s one of the things we look at. When we look at the performance, we assume a sales transfer will occur and despite that we have great returns.", "We often do want to cannibalize ourselves, so to speak. As we go into some of these places we have a very high performing restaurant, we almost need to take some of the sales off but that\u2019s sort of built into our business plan as well.", "As we open up new units on average, just for people who look at us, we start out at a rate that is lower than our total sales average and that\u2019s because we do go into some smaller tier cities that have high returns but then grow quicker over time, is how we\u2019ve seen those markets perform. And then obviously as we go into a developed city, you are sharing that volume over two units or three units versus what was one or two units before so you see some sales transfer there.", "So far we have not seen anything unusual or different on actual sales transfer versus our project sales transfer, so again, all systems go on the new unit front. So one of the things I\u2019m very comfortable about on our model is we look at that all the time, we get great returns, and so we just keep going as long as we keep getting great sites and great trade zones.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "On China, you mentioned when you look at the numbers internally it didn\u2019t appear to be a major deceleration towards the end of the quarter, obviously highlighting weekend shifts and then just to your average and what not. Is it possible you can give some color around what the monthly trend was this year and what the monthly trend was last year, just to kind of get a handle around the degree of any slowdown in December and into January. It just seems as if you are targeting profit growth of 15% to 20%, which is below your long-term target, but yet in 2008, which was presumably a stronger year, it looks like it was only 14% prior to FX. I just wanted to make sure in terms of the degree of conservatism there.", "Richard T. Carucci", "In 2008 we had the 14% growth in operating profit. The system sales growth, in local currency, was still 20%. So our challenge in 2008, from my belief, wasn\u2019t from a sales perspective, it was from a margin perspective. We talked about that with the higher chicken commodity cost. So when I look at 2007, 2008 all in, again, we felt pretty good about the sales level growth and the unit-development growth. ", "What we did experience is we did see a deceleration of sales, really starting with the earthquake in about the middle of the year. And since that time, you know, you get better weeks and months versus others, but I would it\u2019s been fairly consistent during that period of time.", "So as we look into 2009, it\u2019s hard to predict. As I mentioned, one, we don\u2019t share monthly, but secondly, it wouldn\u2019t help because you have Chinese New Year, you have a lot of stuff happening in January in China so it\u2019s hard to predict how the sales will develop month-by-month, or even quarter-to-quarter, given what\u2019s happening there.", "But we do expect the commodity piece to get better. We had $78.0 million of commodities in the full year of 2008. We probably expect a similar type level in the first quarter and then after that we expect it to get better. So we actually expect to get commodity declines in the back half of the year.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "The sales in December and January were not overly, the deceleration was perhaps not much of a surprise to you over the past two months.", "Richard T. Carucci", "As I said, it depended on the week. It was in the range of about on expectations to slightly below our expectations.", "David C. Novak", "Put another way, I wasn\u2019t getting a lot of phone calls complaining about their sales.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "At your analysts day in December you talked about cash and the effort to stockpile. I know you historically kind of run $100.0 million to $200.0 million on the balance sheet at any point in time. Can you talk about an update on your willingness for share repurchase or debt paydown by the end of the first half? I think you had mentioned that was a possibility just with how quickly you do generate that cash, I was wondering how you might spend it if things were to slow, from the fundamental standpoint, whether you would use that earlier for share purchase, for example.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, as we said in December, our plans are for no share repurchases in the year. In the first half very unlikely we would do anything. And then as we look at the back half of the year, as we generate more cash, we will look at an option of paying down debt or some possible share buybacks. But in this environment we are probably more focused on getting the balance sheet strong and getting our debt down.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "On the U.S. side, just on the margins in the quarter, it looked like the food costs were only up about 20 basis points, even though the comps were up about 2%. I know you had some more pricing in there but the overall comp was still fairly soft. And then just the leverage on the payroll side, it was almost 200 basis points of leverage there. I just wanted to get some clarification if that\u2019s something that could have a run rate or is this some sort of unusual quarter?", "Tim Jerzyk", "The biggest impact on those things that you mentioned, food costs up slightly and labor cost down, is mostly from refranchising. If you look at the mix of stores that we sold by brand, it was very much Pizza Hut and Long John Silver's driven for the year. And particularly in the back half, more so Pizza Hut. And because of the food costs and labor costs mix, at Pizza Hut in particular, versus the same numbers at Taco Bell and KFC, it is basically a portfolio mix. So when you have got higher labor costs at Pizza Hut then existing brands, Taco Bell and KFC. So as you sell those stores you are going to have that kind of an impact.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "How do you see restaurant margins performing over the course of 2009 in the U.S.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Obviously it will depend some on the sales level, but we mentioned the commodity piece, it will also depend on how much that gets better in the second half of the year. We are very focused on conversion this year. We are putting a lot of emphasis on margins. I expect us to do better on margins in 2009 than 2008 but obviously we have to show you that quarter in and quarter out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Larry Miller \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Larry Miller \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I think you alluded to this throughout the call but I would love to get more color. One of the things I think is great about the investment story is year in, year out you deliver that 10% earnings growth and this year you are starting off a little slower than plan in Q1 and you are talking about a mid-single digit decrease in profit in Q1 and that would imply that you need something like 13% or so profit growth throughout the year despite headwinds of foreign exchange in China slowing. And the U.S. compares, relative to 2007, are a little bit harder. So, you are expressing a lot of comfort and I was wondering if you could point out those couple of things other than cost savings that you need to get down in 2009 that give you that high level of comfort.", "Richard T. Carucci", "We sort of mentioned and I won\u2019t review them all again, I do want to highlight to everybody, we do have unusual things in Q1 that aren\u2019t going to continue throughout the year. Those area a combination of both cost things on the commodity side and sales things, like KFC in the U.S. getting we think better and lapping very strong sales in China in the first half of the year.", "So the reason we believe we can do better in the back half of the year is if we still will have an environment where commodities are not going up any more, in fact they could be coming down, and we will have another year of getting the sales layers in place, and we think we can make pretty good progress as we have that combination in place.", "The other thing that we spent a lot of time on has been the G&A and as David mentioned, we did that work and we were working on that really through a good chunk of 2008 to get ready for 2009 and it was something we strategically wanted to do but it also will help our financial picture.", "So the G&A piece, we will get some benefit to that in Q1 but that improvement will also get better throughout the year. So I feel we have got our cost up managed well and we believe as we get the easier overlaps in the back half of the year we will do better on the sales line.", "Larry Miller \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "As to China, it certainly held up pretty well given that comparison you had, that 23% to the year ago. Are you seeing any changes at all in the way the Chinese consumer is using the brand today? You mentioned the higher [inaudible]. Is it a frequency decline, are you seeing some negative mix? ", "And then I don\u2019t know if you ever looked at it but have you ever looked at what rate of Chinese GDP growth you all need in your business to get what you would call positive same store sales?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Let me add to the second part first. What we always look at in China is we look at can we get development. Again, let\u2019s not forget our story in China is a development story. That\u2019s our biggest concern, is does the business still have those opportunities and as I mentioned several times on the call we feel very confident about that. Trade zones continue to grow in China and new cities continue to grow in China and I don\u2019t see that trend stopping. So we feel very good about that piece of it.", "Regarding the same-store-sales growth, as long as we stay anything above flattish is actually okay for us on the development side, from a business model side. We obviously prefer to have same-store-sales growth.", "In terms of how people are accessing the brand, we have not seen any really big changes. As the economy has gotten a little tighter, the one thing we have seen is maybe a little reduction on soft drink incidents. Some people have come in and cut back on that purchase. Other than that we haven\u2019t seen any significant changes.", "David C. Novak", "The only point I would add to that is we look at just the middle class, the growth of the middle class being key to our success. There are more people in the middle class today than a year ago and the middle class has more income than they had a year ago. ", "Having said that, we do recognize, obviously, consumer sentiment is down. So the big thing we want to do is we know we\u2019ve got an incredible long-term proposition in China. We continue to think that our China opportunity represents the best restaurant opportunity in the world, bar none. We don\u2019t even think there is a close second in terms of that.", "So the thing that we are focused on this year is the thing that we have been focused on in the past, work on the fundamentals of building great brands. So what you are going to be seeing this year is you will see continued progress with us expanding into new proteins and new day parts. We have had successful shrimp and fish promotions, we recently launched the beef wrap at KFC. ", "We now have KFC breakfast in 90% of our restaurants and we think we have a significant to improve our breakfast business as we go forward. I think our mix is only 5% to 6%. We are going to try and take that in the 10% to 15% range like we have done in Singapore and other Asian markets.", "We now have delivery in 23 cities, KFC delivery, which is getting us into a higher guest check at KFC. And the dinner business, we are going to be moving into 65 cities. And the KFC is the leading brand for young people and teens. Even though the economy is tough, there are still more kids out there that have money than a year ago. So these are factors that I think bode well for KFC.", "When we look at Pizza Hut, it\u2019s the number one casual dining brand in China and we have dramatically expanded our menu so that we offer much more than pizza. We have a full line of appetizers, pasta, rice, we have tea time now with coffee and sweets. We\u2019re giving the consumers more variety and we are really transforming our whole casual dining business to make it even more powerful as we go forward.", "And then we continue to expand Pizza Home service and we are developing East Dawning, the Chinese fast food concept that we have talked about. When I look back, I remember the Asian currency crisis in 1998 and people were going, \u201cOh, my God, can you open up more stores?\u201d ", "We just kept building these brands and we have had great unit economics. Someone talked about unit economics in China. Nobody has unit economics like we do in China. That\u2019s why we can go in tier-4 or tier-5 cities and other people can\u2019t.", "So that\u2019s why this year we\u2019re stronger than we have ever been versus competition. Competition hasn\u2019t gotten closer to us; we\u2019ve widened the gap. So that\u2019s a tremendous strength as we go forward and our goal next year is to have a wider gap. ", "I am really please to hear that people are having difficulties moving into tier-4 and tier-5 cities. That is great news for us because we\u2019re not and we\u2019re going to keep growing the business.", "We have a lot of challenges this year, there\u2019s no doubt about it. There\u2019s lots of challenges that we haven\u2019t had from an overall economic standpoint but there\u2019s nothing like having the power of great brands and the ability to leverage your assets by giving the consumers more. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on, all around the world.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Howard Penney - Research Edge.", "Howard Penney - Research Edge", "One of the things that we are constantly reminded of following this industry is when the company accelerates the pace of development for an extended period of time that not all the stores that open are opening up at the right levels of returns. And in the past two years your capex has grown by nearly 60% and that is 30% faster than revenues. I know years ago McDonald\u2019s used to espouse the Ken [inaudible] theorem that looked at the relative income and population in the U.S. and compared that to other markets, and that didn\u2019t really work for them. So my question is why, when you look at income levels and population in China, or any country for that matter, at penetration rates, how do we know that you are not growing too fast, one? And two, is there a chance that this is sort of the peak in the growth rate, this 1,400, 1,500 unit level or the 900 unit, or is that going to head higher as we enter the year?", "Richard T. Carucci", "A few things. Again, like you say, you just can\u2019t look at the statistics of income, etc. by itself but it is a good thing to have and we have talked about that, about outside the U.S. we have under three restaurants per million people versus 60 restaurants per million people in the U.S.", "Secondly, you look at your competitive position, as David mentioned earlier, we generally have only a few competitors in our markets outside the U.S. so you have that strength as well. ", "But one of the things we have spent a lot of time doing is we look at our performance of new units and while we have increased over time, if you were to look at it by country, those increases have generally been gradual. So we didn\u2019t have units from 200 to 1,495, we have done that over time and by building discipline. If you look at our returns, obviously we think we have been overall pretty good stewards of capital and to ensure that we can continue to get great returns.", "So we take a lot of pride in that. If you looked at our general managers around the world, ask any one of them how their new units are performing, they would all know those answers at the top of their head and be able to talk about it in a fair amount of depth.", "We look at development as just a very important part of strategy, it\u2019s our day job. And we have a lot of process and discipline built around it. Usually when you run into problems is when you try to expand too early too quickly and if you start explaining your returns are down because of, that story, or you start reducing or relaxing your site criteria. ", "As we have gone through our path we have not relaxed our site criteria. If anything, we have tightened them up. So you can never be perfect. We\u2019ve made mistakes as well in development over time. I won\u2019t say we\u2019re perfect but I think we\u2019re pretty good at it.", "Regarding the first part, on the increase we\u2019ve had in capital. Some of that was existing units and just catching up to what we think we needed to do to properly maintain those units. You\u2019re going to see that in China. That number continues to go up because obviously we have increased our new-unit growth and if you look at some of those units are now coming up for remodeling. So in China you are going to see higher capital costs of both the new unit size, we hopefully can increase that number over time, but also as we take care of the units we\u2019ve already built.", "David C. Novak", "I\u2019ll tell you how you\u2019ll know when we have a problem. We\u2019ll slowdown. We\u2019re fixated on three things that drive shareholder value. Same store sales growth, new unit development, and return on invested capital. And since you\u2019re giving us a history lesson, if you go back and study history, what happened is is people grew without any sense of what was going on with their returns. And that was a big problem, I think, during that decade. A lot of companies did that. And people weren\u2019t fixated on return on invested capital. Everybody started looking at how everybody was spending their money and they weren\u2019t getting a whole lot of returns.", "So that\u2019s not a problem that we have. I want our investors to know, we are not chasing any numbers. We\u2019re not even chasing 10% EPS growth. We think we can get 10% EPS growth. But if we thought it was going to be 8% we would tell you it\u2019s 8%. We want to do what we say.", "We are not chasing numbers. I have always said we will never grow faster than our people capability. And the reason why we\u2019re growing so fast in China is we have the best restaurant teams in the world. We have almost two restaurant managers per store that are ready to be restaurant general managers, so we can open up stores with great operations and we continue to get great returns.", "The minute that we don\u2019t get great returns we will turn the faucet off and we will go back and figure out what we have to do to get great returns and we will tell you. The big thing that we have is that we discipline around us and we\u2019re not chasing numbers because we know, to your point, that is how companies get in trouble.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Just as an example, what we mean by that discipline, when we have new unit capital budgets, those are not fixed budgets. So for example, we have said to China, sorry China, you\u2019ve hit your new unit budget, even though you\u2019re getting 30% returns, please stop. Similarly, if we see problems, either in a country or even in a section of a country, as I mentioned earlier at Pizza Hut tier-1 cities, we reduce the capital and reset it down so people don\u2019t get to spend their capital budget estimate at the beginning of the year, they have to earn it throughout the year and get the returns.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley - Banc of America.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "Again on China, just a couple of detail things. You shared that the December 2007 monthly performance was very strong, I think 23% same-store-sales growth. Any reason why it spiked up at the end of 2007? It really is looking backwards quite a bit.", "And with China, just where you are in pricing, year-over-year? And how much visibility there is for food costs to actually come down in the back half of the year.", "Tim Jerzyk", "On the question about the December comps, basically throughout the quarter, I think the third quarter 2007 comps for China were plus 11 and we basically entered the quarter, which for China in fourth quarter, September is the first month. We basically entered at that kind of rate and by the time we got to the end of the quarter it was basically accelerating at like 4 points every month. It was just what was going on. And at the same time, like Rick said earlier, we pointed out last year our development was also getting stronger and stronger. At the end of the year, well ahead of our beginning of the year expectations in terms of new unit development.", "In terms of pricing, our current run right now is right in the 4% to 5% range. Half of that rolls off in March and the other half comes off in August and the full year impact right now, if we take no pricing, would be about 2.5%.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "On the [E West] you indicated the dinner day part is solved and obviously that threatened KFC. Has Taco Bell slowed down as well? If you can would you share the brand performance for the fourth quarter?", "Richard T. Carucci", "The fourth quarter brand performance, I\u2019m looking up the numbers. We did have it in my speech. It was plus 9 for Taco Bell, minus 1 for Pizza Hut, and minus 3 for KFC.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "And have you seen Taco Bell slow in the first part of 2009 like the other two brands?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We don\u2019t expect it to be at that level. It\u2019s not that far off of our expectations but our expectations are not at that level.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "When you started refranchising, does the KFC brand have to turn before you can accelerate the refranchising for KFC? I know much of the 2008 activity was Long John Silver's and Pizza Hut.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Probably, yes, is the short answer to that. For a couple of reasons. We will be able to do some refranchising but people want to see confidence in the brand. We\u2019re not trying to get the last dollar in refranchising but we don\u2019t want to also at the bottom bottom of the market. So we will probably have slow going in KFC until the brand starts to get healthier.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America", "How does pricing look in the U.S. year-over-year? If  you can give it by brand that would be great but even in the aggregate would be helpful.", "Richard T. Carucci", "We are not really planning on a lot of pricing in the U.S. this year. Obviously it will depend in part on what happens with commodities, but if you look at it, I think we\u2019ve got about a 1.0 to 2 point increase, an impact on pricing in 2009. It depends on the brand. So, at Taco Bell we have about a 3 point assumption on pricing, about 2 of that is carry over and about another 1. This year at KFC about a 4 point and then no pricing assumed at Pizza Hut.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Just to run those brand numbers again, Taco Bell was plus 9, KFC was minus 3, and Pizza Hut was minus 1. That was the fourth quarter system.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On China, you talked about Pizza Hut and some of the disappointments in returns, especially in the tier-1 cities and how you have scaled back the growth plans for those cities as well. Would the cutback in the absolute growth, especially including the cutback in the tier-1 markets, if we think about the margins for that business, with lower pre-opening, lower inefficiencies, and just less openings in those tier-1 units, how should we think about the margin impact at Pizza Hut in China and maybe for the whole division as a result?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Just to keep in mind, these are not big factors for China Division. To put the numbers in perspective, we probably built about 30 Pizza Hut dining units in tier-1, tier-2 cities in 2008. We expect that number to be about 10 in 2009. So it really is not going to have a material impact on overall China margins.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Cash flow for the fourth quarter and therefore for the full year, came in below what I was looking for and I think what you were probably generally guiding to as well. And it looks like a large portion of that was a massive reduction in accounts payable. I\u2019m just wondering if there was a reason or rationale behind this? It looks it declines more than I would have anticipated, given the refranchising. Is this something that maybe will turn in 2009? Is it temporary? How should we think about that?", "Tim Jerzyk", "If you\u2019re looking at versus end of year last year, which is the best way to do it, the biggest Delta there is the Japan gain. It\u2019s the way it was accounted for at the end of last year. In fact, it was like $100.0 million.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Of the accounts payable decline?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes. In the that occur liability side there was an impact of $100.0 million. $128.0 million. It was accounted for because of the fact that if you go back, the transaction actually occurred after the year end for YRI but before the Yum! year end so it was because of the lag for YRI accounting of 30 days, it had that balance sheet impact, at year end.", "It\u2019s basically that and the fact that we did sell 700 stores last year and, as you may recall, in our business on company stores, basically you do lose working capital when you sell stores.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "On KFC in the U.S., what is the percent of U.S. profits generated by KFC? At this time.", "Tim Jerzyk", "For KFC U.S. as a percentage of the total?", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "I think you said it was 60% for Taco Bell.", "Tim Jerzyk", "End of year it was 8% for KFC U.S.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass - Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Can you just go back on your commentary about what\u2019s happened in the U.S. in the last four weeks, has this been an abrupt slowdown or simply a continuation of trends you saw in the fourth quarter? And what is the likelihood that comps for the quarter end up being negative because of the slowdown?", "Richard T. Carucci", "It\u2019s very hard to predict in this environment exactly what\u2019s going to happen with sales. I do expect that sales, as we said before, will be a tough environment. I expect sales to be down below what we were expecting in December but I really can\u2019t give you a great number with precision. Q1 is obviously going to be softer than Q4.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "There has been a lot of discussion about what\u2019s going on in China as it relates to the slowdown, but what advantages does the slowdown give you in China? For example, in the United States, rent relief has been a big topic among retailers. There has been discussion of lower wage inflation. And have you seen any of those things manifest themselves in China yet? Or does the dynamic even work the same way there, or to a greater or lesser extent?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Probably to a lesser extent but it will be there. For example, the government did a lot of things on benefits in 2008. They have already said they are not going to do anything new on that in 2009. Obviously we are going to negotiate hard, the way we always negotiate, on real estate, and we have a better opportunity to do that in this environment than we did, let\u2019s say a year ago.", "Tim Jerzyk", "And I think , as we pointed out, we saw fund dollars are up so capital is not an issue for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "On YRI, great performance in the fourth quarter. Can you give us a sense of where you saw an uptick in comps from the third quarter?", "Richard T. Carucci", "The thing we feel good about, if you look at the two-year growth in YRI, it\u2019s been about flat through the year so we have had pretty consistent growth in YRI, if you look at the numbers over the last three-year period. So there hasn\u2019t been dramatic shifts between Q3 and Q4. I think the growth difference was a point.", "But if you look at the table we gave in the earnings release, the thing that I feel really good about is just the breadth of the growth. It\u2019s really every continent across many countries. So that\u2019s the thing that gives us a lot confidence. And the other thing is that we are making good progress for us in the high-growth markets than our strategic initiatives.", "So we feel really good about that and the fact that it is franchise-driven growth. 94% of the new units being franchise-built, really just speaks to the overall strength of the market and our system and our brands.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "There hasn\u2019t been too much commentary on Kentucky Grilled Chicken. Can you give us a sense of how many stores it\u2019s in now? Have the trends continued? It would seem to be very strong in tests in 2007 and 2008. Can you give us a sense, did those trends continue in the back half of 2008? And how do you plan on marketing Kentucky Grilled Chicken? Is there any particular focus to get people in the stores to try this type of product?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Really no change in the trends from we talked about before on grilled product. It\u2019s been in tests for years. And it\u2019s not in more restaurants because they\u2019re still putting the ovens in. The test markets were San Diego, Indianapolis, and Oklahoma City. The difference between those and the other markets really hasn\u2019t changed from what we last reported. So it\u2019s a product that has been tested for a long period of time, which is obviously by the system is going to go forward. And on the positioning of it I will let David say a few words.", "David C. Novak", "I think that we have got a big bold approach to introducing this and I would rather just save that until we announce it. Because we\u2019re going to get a lot of value out of the announcement.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Analyst for Greg Badishkanian - Citi.", "Analyst for Greg Badishkanian - Citi", "On refranchising, quick update on what the pipeline looks like now and per your comments about KFC, is your target of 500 units more back-end loaded this year?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Not particularly. It\u2019s always to predict when deals will close. We have a decent pipeline. The credit is about the same as what we talked about last time, it\u2019s tight but available, but not as broadly available as it was a year ago.", "We don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into how it\u2019s really going to develop by quarter.", "David C. Novak", "The thing I would add, and we have said this before, is that we have never needed refranchising for anything in our company. There has never been a time table that we were wedded to, to do refranchising because it is something we need to do.", "It\u2019s a strategic decision that we\u2019ve made that we feel very good about and we are going to get there the right way. And obviously the world has changed dramatically since we have talked about our refranchising strategy, so the timing will change and it will take longer, but the strategic intent remains.", "Analyst for Greg Badishkanian - Citi", "On KFC U.S., the rollout of the national value menu, I think you said next week is the launch, how big of an impact do you expect that to be, particularly in relation to [inaudible], in terms of just driving your overall growth at KFC for 2009?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think our biggest gun that we have this year is Kentucky Grilled Chicken. That\u2019s how I would look at it. I think we are being more competitive on the value front with the launch of this national menu but Subway has the $5 subs, McDonald\u2019s has the $1 menu, Wendy\u2019s has Freakanomics. Everybody has got value. I think what we\u2019re doing is just getting in the game, maybe a little late. So I don\u2019t see this as a game changer for us, but I think it does make us more competitive.", "But throughout the year we are going to be attacking two major barriers. The first is we need opportunities to offer more than just fried chicken to broaden our menu offering, make it more appealing to more people. And the second is value. So we\u2019ve got comprehensive programs, including this value program, to keep those two messages front and center throughout the year.", "But the big gun that we see is Kentucky Grilled Chicken.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Related to the U.S., can you drill down a little bit more specifically about that dinner pressure you are seeing, whether it\u2019s more traffic driven or are you also seeing check management, I guess related to that and related to the Kentucky Grilled Chicken roll out, is it worrisome to be launching such a big campaign when the dinner business, seemingly across brands, and you\u2019re not the only ones talking about this, is under significant pressure. Could that maybe stem some of the enthusiasm for that product?", "David C. Novak", "I think that there is no secret that the dinner occasion has been under the most pressure across the category for some time now, so that\u2019s not really new news. When we look at our portfolio, Taco Bell, which is the biggest chunk of the portfolio, 60% of profits, it\u2019s the best positioned clearly, as we go into this year, because of the Why Pay More menu and the fact that it ranks number one in value in the entire category. So it\u2019s got the low end covering.", "As we look at Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut is also working very hard on the value front as well and has Pizza Mia but it is still a higher guest check occasion and pizza is a dinner occasion and it is being impacted.", "But the other thing that really drives our category is innovation. Where we think we are getting significant innovation and we think gives us a lot more strength than our competitors is in the pasta arena and we just launched our lasagna product, which is getting very good consumer feedback and we are very hopeful that that will be a sales driver for us as well.", "And as we go into the second half of the year we will also have nationally advertised Wing Street.", "But having said that, clearly Pizza Hut is not a big lunch, snack type occasion, it\u2019s more of a dinner occasion. So we\u2019re going to innovate to drive sales in that area, broaden our menu to drive sales in that arena, and keep a strong value message out there.", "Yesterday I had a call with the Pizza Hut team and they work very hard on both the value and innovation front and I think you will see a steady stream of news on that as we go forward.", "KFC, I think the first thing we have to do at KFC is really shore up our chicken-on-the bone business, which is a dinner business primarily. We will be doing that with the launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken because we will give people the opportunity to mix and match their buckets and I think it really does broaden our appeal in an occasion that basically needs to be shored up, which is dinner.", "We also have value at the low end nor for the first time with our national value menu, which we think is going to give us more the snacking, lunch type occasion. So we are hopeful that in the combination of the Kentucky Grilled Chicken, which really is a big dinner innovation, which by the way will also be introduced with a good low-end offer which could drive occasions of both lunch and dinner, we think that that major innovation, coupled with what we are doing on value, will give us some business momentum as we move into the year.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "With that said, you laid out 15% profit growth and you are sticking with that today, 9% of that growth seemingly comes from controllable costs which you seemingly have harvested or are pretty far along in getting it, the other 6% was reliant on U.S. core profit growth, driven presumably by same store sales. We started off the year a little bit softer and certainly one month does not a year make, but can you share with us a little bit around the sensitivity of weaker same store sales, how that might flow through the margins or operating profit line if you have those numbers. ", "And I guess in addition, are there other controllable factors, other controllable costs, that you are looking at that if sales do come up short that you can offset?", "Richard T. Carucci", "If you look at our franchise business, the flow through is just related to sales so whatever happens to sales pretty much happens to profits, on the company side, up or down, groceries in the 40% range. I think a hard thing to make the prediction for this year, it was one of the questions earlier, is just the relationship between sales and commodity. And I do expect there to be correlation there, so if the environment is tougher on the sales side, I do expect us to be better on the commodity side. So that\u2019s what makes it tough to call.", "We are doing everything we can on the productivity and cost piece. The biggest piece of that is the G&A but we are looking at all the things that you look at in these types of environments and we\u2019re going to take care of the customer but we\u2019re very focused on our margin this year as well. So we don\u2019t have a lot more to say than we\u2019ve already said.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Fitzhugh Taylor - Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Fitzhugh Taylor - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Last year you were talking about catching up in price at both the U.S. and in China and the U.S. margins seems to reflect a benefit of that while China, at least on the surface, has not. Is the biggest difference there just the refranchising in the U.S. or are there some other pieces that have prohibited some improvement in margins in China?", "Richard T. Carucci", "As Tim mentioned earlier, the refranchising has helped margins, but we were able to catch up pricing with commodities, as I mentioned earlier. So we feel good about that in the U.S. and we expect that to continue in 2009. We expect that to be a positive as whereas a negative through most of 2008, until the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s the U.S. story.", "In China, the difference there was just the magnitude of the commodity cost increase. Remember, we were at a period with China, where even though there was some inflation in China, because KFC was growing and we were getting leverage purchasing, we actually had very little pricing for about a four-year period. And so it\u2019s really only the last couple of years where we had started to price and then we had the huge increase in chicken costs.", "But what really happened to us in China is the chicken costs were high and they\u2019ve been sticky on the way down. We actually do expect them to go down a little bit in the last part of the year so that gets us pretty well caught up by then.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research.", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "I am looking at the dramatic improvement in profitability in the U.S. division in Q4. You had run nine straight quarters of a restaurant margin decline, then all of a sudden it spiked dramatically higher in Q4. And you mentioned that this is related to refranchising. If so, why would we not expect that to continue going forward?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We will get some benefits from refranchising going forward. We also, as we mentioned, did get the benefit of the pricing finally sort of overtaking the commodity cost increase. So our full year guidance was a one point increase in margins for 2009 versus 2008.", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "I\u2019m looking at Q4 and I\u2019m seeing this dramatic change versus previous history. Why would Q4 have spiked so much higher yet you are not really expecting that improvement to continue into 2009?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We are expecting improvement. In terms of that level it is probably most related to the timing of pricing versus commodity increases which probably worked to our favor a little more in Q4 than they will on average throughout 2009. But as we mentioned earlier, that can happen if commodities go in our direction.", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "You talk about restructure charges and U.S. brand reinvestments as your special items. What are these?", "Richard T. Carucci", "The restructuring charges were the severance costs. The investments, the biggest piece of that will be the ovens for KFC. We also had investments in systems for KFC to put systems into franchise test markets. So were the two investment parts there and then the severance is the other piece of restructuring.", "David C. Novak", "Let me just briefly wrap up. First of all, our China business is on track and we continue to expect solid growth, 15% to 20% in 2009, which we adjusted from our long-term target of 20% due to the short-term economic issues that we talked about.", "Second, YRI continues to produce consistent results with the strength of its broad geography of over 110 countries and 700 franchisees and has held up remarkably well during this challenging economic environment. ", "And third, our U.S. business, that has underperformed, is better positioned than ever to grow about 15% in 2009.  Importantly, 9 points of this growth will come from G&A cost reductions we initiated last year.", "Fourth, our company has remarkable financial strength from our global cash flows, strong balance sheet, and there is no need for new financing in 2009. We are fully funded for our global growth, as always.", "With all these things in mind, we continue to expect that we will achieve our EPS growth target of at least 10% in 2009. That\u2019s our story, and we\u2019re sticking to it.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Rachel. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website at www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.

", "July 29th we will host KFC investor day here in Louisville; August 11th we will host Taco Bell investor day in Irvine, California. Please notify us as soon as you can if you plan to attend those events; and then lastly, our next earnings release will be Tuesday, October 6th, which is our third quarter earnings. ", "On our call today you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak. ", "David C. Novak", "Okay, thanks, Tim and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report second quarter EPS growth of 10% before special items. Our global portfolio delivered solid performance with system sales growth of 3% and operating profit growth of 11% prior to foreign currency translation. ", "Our EPS growth was fueled by operating profit growth in each of our divisions and exceeded our expectations due to a much lower than anticipated tax rate. Our industry leading international new unit development continues to be a major driver of operating performance in China and Yum! restaurants international. This capability is unique to our industry and helps us consistently achieve our growth targets. We are especially pleased that each of our businesses delivered profit growth prior to foreign currency translation. ", "Overall, our business continues to perform well in spite of a challenging sales environment. We delivered impressive operating profit growth of 11% due to number one, strong international development; number two, the proactive measures we took last year to reduce our U.S. G&A costs and to improve our margins with productivity majors; and three, a more favorable commodity environment. All in all, this will be a year where profits are up and sales are sluggish. Our 10% EPS growth target, which was viewed to be somewhat aggressive, is still intact. ", "Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, let\u2019s talk about China, where we continue to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. New unit development continues to be the leading contributor to our growth and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in this dynamic growth market. In fact, we have opened 216 units year-to-date and remain on track to deliver at least 475 new units in mainland China. Importantly, our returns continue to be outstanding and these new units will drive profit growth in the coming years. ", "In the second quarter, our system sales in China grew by 8% and our same-store sales were down 4%. As you know, we anticipated this softness because we were lapping 14% same-store sales growth last year. Importantly, our operating profit was up 14%. ", "I also want to emphasize that we are confident as ever in our strategy to continue to expand development across mainland China given the high returns we generate across all tiers of cities and regions. ", "As a reminder, KFC is now in more than 550 cities. Importantly, we are well-staffed with talented and trained restaurant general managers ready to go into new stores as they open. KFC is a major brand with rapid growth that enables recruitment of talented people. ", "There\u2019s no question in our minds that the foundation of our China growth model remains rock solid. ", "Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. KFC continues to lead the western QSR category, approaching 2,700 units today with average unit volumes of $1.4 million. We continue to execute our incremental sales layer strategy, giving consumers more reasons and ways to access our brand. ", "Most significantly, we are targeting major new day parts via expansion of our breakfast menu and home delivery of KFC. Breakfast continues to steadily grow. The team is focused on growing the breakfast menu from currently less than 5% of sales to ultimately owning the breakfast day part in China. ", "KFC delivery business continues to grow and is now offered in 70 cities and over 500 units. KFC in China also stands for much more than chicken by offering beef and fish. This summer we will be introducing new snackable items that are value-priced. The KFC brand continues to build its leading image across key brand measures versus its major competitor. ", "Moving on to Pizza Hut casual dining, it continues to lead the western casual dining category with 435 units in over 100 cities. We are seeing strong consumer response and results from our new menu, which includes new entrees with beef, chicken, and shrimp, along with a wide variety of beverages and desserts. There\u2019s no question Pizza Hut casual dining has made major progress in transforming its menu and service to become a true casual dining concept. ", "We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut home service, a new category we are building, now has 81 units and has expanded beyond top tier cities with presence in 11 cities now. This brand is driving growth with its focus on value, online ordering and by offering home meal replacement solutions that include pizza, pasta, and rice dishes. ", "East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to evolve as we drive for scaleable economics. We are making improvements to service and innovating our menu. Importantly, this quarter we opened our first central kitchen to increase the efficiency of this concept by bringing a portion of the more complex food preparation up-stream to a central facility. We believe this will be a major advance towards improving our unit level economics. ", "In summary, we believe our China business continues to be the largest restaurant opportunity of the 21st century. ", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International, which is the division accountable for the balance of our significant international operations, our strategy for Yum! Restaurants International is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere. I recently attended our franchise convention in Prague. It was great to see our franchisees\u2019 enthusiasm and passion for our brands. They are excited about new unit development and particularly love our ideas for building major sales layers. ", "For the second quarter, system sales grew 6% prior to foreign currency translation, including development of 193 new units in more than 50 countries. Operating profit growth was 6% excluding foreign currency translation. ", "I\u2019d like to commend the teams in KFC U.K., Australia, and Japan for driving stellar sales growth in mature economies that are clearly going through a tough patch. ", "Yum! Restaurants International\u2019s new growth markets delivered 16% system sales growth this quarter with the benefit from new unit development in high growth markets like France and India. Our KFC France business generates the highest KFC average unit volumes in the world of roughly $4 million per year. With this kind of sales, we believe we have the unit economics to drive scale and can expand KFC rapidly from 79 units and modest profits today to over 300 units and at least $100 million in profits in France. ", "Likewise, India continues to drive impressive growth. We now have nearly 50 KFCs. Same-store sales are up around 25% and we now have double-digit store level margins. We are more confident than ever that we will be able to build significant KFC scale. ", "Pizza Hut with 157 units is also driving strong growth and this year was highlighted as the most trusted food service brand by the economics times of India for the fifth consecutive year. ", "Later this year, I will be visiting India to see first-hand the progress we are making at KFC and Pizza Hut and also to witness the opening of the first Taco Bell. ", "There\u2019s no doubt India is a huge opportunity for Yum! Brands with its over 1 billion people and 60% of its people being under 30 years old. ", "I am pleased to say we are also making progress on the foundation for making Taco Bell a global brand. We now have 202 traditional units in over 15 countries outside the U.S. In the next 12 months, we will be opening Taco Bell in new markets like Panama, Peru, Cypress, and Korea. Taco Bell represents a great way for franchisees to leverage their infrastructure and enthusiasm is growing as we get more and more markets up and running. ", "For KFC and Pizza Hut, we continue to be focused on building our incremental sales layers. KFC's crushers line of beverages continues its rapid expansion and is showing up in places like India, Brazil, the Philippines, and the Middle East. ", "We are now in over 450 units in 19 countries, nearly double where we were in the first quarter. We are aggressively expanding this layer and expect to have crushers in over 2,000 KFCs by the end of the year, up from just over 100 as we entered 2009. This is just the beginning of a new base of products that will allow us to begin building a full line of contemporary beverages that can be enjoyed as either a snack or dessert. ", "Our KFC breakfast initiative we call KFC A.M. continues to grow as well with nearly 400 units, primarily in Asia. It\u2019s also being tested in the U.K., South Africa, and soon in the Middle East and the Caribbean. We believe breakfast is a great opportunity outside the U.S. where there is much less competition. ", "Pizza Hut's big move is to expand its menu to include more pastas, more appetizers, more desserts, and more beverages. We are definitely elevating our game to become a true casual dining brand around the globe and know that offering more than just pizza is a must for long-term success. ", "Just like China, the foundation for Yum! Restaurants International growth is on track and rock solid. ", "Next on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency, and returns. For the second quarter, U.S. same-store sales declined 1%. Both Taco Bell and KFC had positive same-store sales growth which was offset by the weakness at Pizza Hut. ", "As a matter of fact, KFC turned around its sales from a 7% decline in the first quarter with the successful launch of Kentucky Grilled Chicken. Consumers absolutely love this product and the best advertising you can have is word of mouth. And if you haven\u2019t tried it, you should. It is definitely a five-start product. ", "Kentucky Grilled Chicken clearly addressed an unmet consumer need and the biggest barrier for this brand --  people cutting back on fried foods. We had a powerful marketing campaign and as a result, we had an unprecedented 30 point swing in our same-store sales growth versus pre-launch. Kentucky Grilled Chicken is already a significant product for the brand and is sustaining at over 40% of our chicken-on-the-bone sales. This has to be the best product launch in our history and I don\u2019t know of any other product in our industry that has changed a brand so much for the good. ", "Having said that, after the introductory launch, sales flattened during the $9.99 grilled bucket value promotion, showing just how difficult it is to drive dinner price points. Going forward, our goal is to get all fast food users to try Kentucky Grilled Chicken, focusing on individual meals. We only have 20% trial and most of America goes to KFC once a year. So we have major upside to keep growing the business. ", "Now here\u2019s why we are very confident that Kentucky Grilled Chicken is here to stay. First, the product is loved, with 85% of consumers finding it appealing and importantly, over 85% expressing repurchase intent. ", "Second, the operating platform works and third, we have major product innovation that we will build off this platform with other grilled type products. Kentucky Grilled Chicken was a must-have for the brand to turn this business and there\u2019s no question that it gives us a great platform going forward for growth. ", "Taco Bell continues to do relatively well, given we have the number one value image in the category, which is perfect for these times. We will continue to reinforce our why pay more menu and continue to introduce great-tasting products like our Volcano Tacos, Burritos, and nachos. ", "At Pizza Hut, however, we are really struggling [by growth] in this more discretionary, higher ticket dinner occasion. This challenge is magnified as we lap strong results from the launch of pasta last year. Balance of year, Pizza Hut will be launching new pizzas and nationally advertised Wing Street. Our food has never been better and we are making the necessary investments to end this year with the variety we need to grow. ", "We remain condiment in our strategy of transforming Pizza Hut to include pasta and wings, along with our world famous pizzas. ", "2009 is a year where we are especially appreciative of our global portfolio. Our international new unit development combined with our tight cost management should allow us to deliver 10% EPS growth for the full year. This will allow us to build on our seven-year track record of double-digit EPS growth. ", "At the same time, our company\u2019s position is as strong as ever and our efforts in 2009 will pay dividends in 2010 and beyond. ", "Now let me hand it over to Rick to give you more details. Rick. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David and good morning. During our call today, I am going to comment on three areas -- our second quarter results, our outlook for the second half of 2009, and our approach for managing our business during the balance of this year. ", "Yum! delivered second quarter EPS of $0.50 per share for growth of 10% excluding special items. Before we review our results by business segment, it may be useful to highlight some of the key themes that categorize our Q2 performance. ", "Theme number one -- sales in the U.S. and China, our two biggest businesses, were below our expectations. ", "Theme number two -- despite these sales results, margins in the U.S. and China were significantly better than expectations. ", "Theme number three -- we were delivering U.S. business G&A spending reductions and will at least meet our full-year G&A commitment. ", "Theme number four -- Yum! is continuing to benefit from its status of being the largest international developer. We remain on track toward achieving our new unit growth targets and this is leading our profit growth in China and YRI. ", "Now let\u2019s look at our second quarter results by business segment, beginning with China. China division system sales grew 7% and operating profit grew 11% excluding foreign currency translation. Please note that this is on top of operating profit growth in 2008 of 26% excluding for-ex. ", "This profit growth was fueled by new restaurant development and continued margin improvement versus last year, which more than offset the same-store sales decline of 4%. ", "In the second quarter, we saw some sales weakness in big export driven markets, especially versus Central and West regions. However, to keep the same-store sales results in perspective, please note that our two-year growth numbers are still quite positive in an environment where we are adding new units at an 18% annual rate. ", "During the quarter, we opened 118 new restaurants in Mainland China. Our returns continue to be exceptional for new KFCs in Mainland China. As I explained on our last call, new units continue to meet our high expectations with projected returns on investment of nearly 30%. This is an all-in return taking into consideration estimated sales transfer from nearby stores and an allocation of corporate G&A. As long as we continue to expect this type of return, we will continue to rapidly expand in China. ", "Restaurant margin was nearly 18% in the second quarter or 0.8 points above last year. The increase in margin was primarily driven by some remaining pricing benefit from 2008 actions and modest commodity deflation. ", "Now on to YRI -- system sales and operating profit growth were both 6% prior to foreign currency translation, driven by same-store sales growth of 1% and net unit development of plus 4%. YRI added 193 units in the second quarter and is still on track to add about 900 units for the full year. ", "Both restaurant and operating margins improved for the second quarter, reflecting the benefit of solid growth, combined with a franchise nominated business. While there was solid growth for both sales and operating profit in local currency terms, foreign currency translation continues to have a major impact on this business. ", "Foreign translation dampened second quarter profits by $24 million, resulting in lower YRI profits in dollar terms for 2009 versus 2008.", "In the U.S., same-store sales declined by 1%, driven by a decline of 8% at Pizza Hut, nearly offset by 3% growth for KFC and 1% growth at Taco Bell. Consumer spending is obviously restrained and we don\u2019t see that changing. ", "Despite a slight sales decline in U.S. sales, we saw second quarter restaurant margin increase by over two full points. We are seeing dramatically improved commodity cost environment in the U.S. For the first time in quite a while, we saw commodity cost deflation of $4 million in the quarter. ", "As previously communicated, U.S. profitability in 2009 will also benefit from the restructuring which was completed in late 2008 and early 2009. There was $18 million in G&A savings for the second quarter which is on top of $20 million of savings in the first quarter. ", "We are quite proud of the efforts of our U.S. teams to achieve these productivity improvements. The good news is this is at the same time -- at the same time our productivity improved, our customer measures are equal to or better than last year. The combination of restaurant margin improvement and G&A reductions led to operating profit growth of 8% in the U.S. ", "Prior to closing the books on the U.S., I would like to mention that our refranchising program has continued to move forward. Although tight credit markets continue to slow transactions, we refranchised nearly 200 restaurants year-to-date and we remain on pace to achieve our full-year target of 500 units. ", "For Yum! overall, there are two other factors that I would like to highlight in the second quarter -- our tax rate and the impact of the Shanghai business entity ownership change. ", "The quarter two tax rate of 16% excluding special items was well below our previous expectation and was a key driver to why overall second quarter EPS results were also ahead of expectation. ", "While this helped drive higher than expected Q2 earnings per share growth, it did not drive year-over-year results because we were lapping a record low tax rate of 15% in the second quarter of 2008. ", "While it\u2019s very hard to accurately forecast our tax rates, we now expect the full-year tax rate of around 25%, or two points lower than the estimate starting the year. This reflects the better-than-expected year-to-date tax rate prior to special items. ", "Please note that while EPS excluding special items increased by 10% in the second quarter, reported EPS increased by 40% to $0.63 per share. While we believe that EPS excluding special items is a better indicator of our underlying business performance, I do want to briefly explain these reported results. ", "In the second quarter, we increased our ownership in the KFC Shanghai business entity from 51% to 58%. This resulted in a required write-up in asset carry value to market and a gain of $68 million. The acquisition of this additional ownership led us to an accounting position where we now consolidate the KFC Shanghai business in our financial reporting. ", "To summarize the second quarter for Yum!, it was great to see each of our divisions achieve solid profit growth prior to foreign currency translation. The EPS growth of 10% before special items also benefited from lower interest expense versus last year and fewer average diluted shares outstanding. These benefits helped to offset approximately $0.03 per share of negative foreign currency translation impact for the quarter. ", "All things considered, we were quite satisfied with our second quarter results. ", "Now let\u2019s look forward to the second half of the year -- overall we expect the trends previously discussed in the second quarter to continue into the third quarter and possibly for the balance of the year. We expect the challenging consumer environment to continue. This will translate into softer than usual sales growth in the U.S. and China, offset by reduced costs in both of these businesses. ", "In fact, we expect to see significant improvement in year-over-year commodity costs in both the U.S. and China. For the balance of this year, we anticipate commodity deflation of about $10 million in the U.S. and commodity deflation of nearly $50 million in China. ", "We expect to continue to deliver G&A cost reductions in the U.S. as a way to help deliver our bottom line. We anticipate that we will achieve at least the $60 million reduction in G&A costs we\u2019ve discussed previously. ", "Finally, our international development will continue during the second half of the year. We are on track to open 1,400 new units in China and YRI combined for 2009. This will help deliver profit growth in 2009 and into 2010 as well. ", "At YRI, with the first half pace of over 3% same-store sales growth, we expect little change for the balance of the year. With its diversity of markets as a core strength, we expect YRI to generate about 3% same-store sales growth for 2009. We are expecting a slight moderation in the negative impact from foreign currency translation when comparing the second half of the first half. That\u2019s based on exchange rates today and is obviously subject to change. ", "When we look at Yum!'s overall balance of year expectations, we expect a higher rate of worldwide operating profit in the second half versus the first half. This will be offset somewhat by unfavorable impacts from non-operating factors like our tax rate and shares outstanding. ", "We completed last year\u2019s large share repurchases in the third quarter. As a result, the average diluted share count will shift from year-over-year declines in both Q1 and Q2 of this year to a slight increase by the fourth quarter. In addition, while our full year tax estimate is lower, we currently anticipate a slight EPS headwind due to tax in the second half of the year. ", "Please note in our release last night, we provided a link to our website that provides a more detailed update of significant changes in our guidance. ", "As we have the first half of 2009 behind us, let\u2019s look at how we are approaching the balance of this year. As I said on our last call, we are living in a difficult environment for making forecasts. This picture really hasn\u2019t changed. It clearly is harder than normal to predict how sales and costs will play out the remaining half of this year. We are focused on continuing our track record of seven consecutive years of double-digit EPS growth. The good news is that we have 12% EPS growth for the first half already in the bank. ", "I am very proud of how Yum! has managed its costs in the first half. We plan to continue this focus for the balance of the year. We\u2019ll also continue to strengthen already strong balance sheet. At the same time, we will keep working to ensure we end up with an even better long-term debt structure. ", "As David discussed, we will be very focused on continuing to build our new incremental sales layers. While this often involves some capital investment for new equipment, we remain confident that these are the right strategies to strengthen our brand positions for the long-term. ", "We are not sacrificing other investments in our long-term growth. We recognize that one of the things that makes Yum! special is a very long runway for our global growth. We are continuing to make investments to capture this growth opportunity. ", "For example, we continue to open new Taco Bell units in YRI and build scale in a key growth market like India, even though major profit contributions from these investments are well into the future. ", "2009 would mark our eighth straight year of double-digit EPS growth. When we look back upon our track record, each year has been unique. [In any one year, we meet] or exceed expectations in many areas of our business and we usually face opportunities and challenges that we did not expect. However, I believe it is very fair to say that we consistently benefit from a resilient global business model led by strong management teams throughout the world. Our leaders feel a very high degree of accountability to deliver both annual financial performance and the long-term business values. ", "I remain confident that we will end 2009 and enter 2010 with an even stronger and better-positioned company. ", "Back to you, David. ", "David C. Novak", "Okay, great. Well, let\u2019s just move right into Q&A and answer the questions. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Okay, let\u2019s open up for questions, Rachel. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS. ", "Analyst for David Palmer - UBS", "This is Stefan on for David. Are there any particular data points that you can offer us with regard to the buying patterns of the Chinese consumer? So for instance, are they trading down within the menu? Are families going less often? Or are consumers in the big city behaving differently than they are maybe in the smaller cities? So any color on the Chinese consumer would be helpful. Thank you. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "A macro level and then we\u2019ll bring it down to our business there -- at the macro level, as we sort of said before, we saw the big bump in China sales, the bloom came off the roses after the earthquake last year. And then business was pretty steady after that, and then we saw another decline in sentiment when the worldwide issues started with the financial crisis in the U.S. So those are really the two data points that we thought were the two major ones from the consumer standpoint. ", "With the November change, the one thing that we felt in our business is that there\u2019s been a little less soft drink incidents, so some people may be trading out of soft drinks. That really started in November, it really hasn\u2019t changed materially between then and now. ", "The Chinese consumer, you know, again, I sort of look at it this way -- overall China economy is a better economy, in better shape than most economies around the world. We still feel very bullish about the long-term trends in China. Right now, the consumer is cautious. Their saving rates are still -- continue to rise, so they are being conservative with their spending right now. ", "Analyst for David Palmer - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Two questions -- first, a non-operating factor, interest expense number was considerably lower than what we were thinking, lower than the first quarter. It didn\u2019t look like your debt total changed very much. I know you did some debt reshuffling, I guess I\u2019d say, probably not the best term, during the quarter but what should we expect going forward on that interest expense line?", "Tim Jerzyk", "On that, basically for the second quarter it\u2019s a reflection of the really lower rates, lower LIBOR rates which drives our variable interest expense and those are really low. So that\u2019s a big benefit. ", "And then also for the quarter, our average debt balance was quite a bit lower than last year, so even though the quarter end debt was about the same or actually a little higher, the average for the quarter was quite a bit below. And then also we did take out some of our long-term debt. You saw with the debt tender, the bond tender offer. So this should be, you know, depending on what your forecast is for short-term rates is going forward, this should be a pretty good basis going forward for interest expense. ", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then a question also on China -- so the two-year run-rate you are implying for the back half of the year decelerates pretty substantially. This quarter you were plus 10 on a two-year basis and if my math is right, your guidance for the second half implies kind of five, plus six maybe third quarter, plus two in the fourth. The macro news coming out of China seems to be getting better, not worse, so could you address why you think it\u2019s falling off so dramatically?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I\u2019ll take a little bit of a shot at that. The economy in China, you know, we think has been steady. I think what happened a little bit, Joe, is the forecast went down a lot in the first quarter and it seems to have gone up a lot in the second quarter, so I think it\u2019s more the forecasts that have changed in the quarters than the real economy. ", "The stuff that\u2019s improving in China tends to be some of the large durable goods, of which there\u2019s heavy government subsidies right now towards incenting that, so I\u2019m not sure that the consumer sentiment has changed that much since November of last year. ", "In terms of our business, you know, we gave in our link what we think our full-year numbers will be in China, which is about flat same-store sales for the full year and that\u2019s based on what\u2019s occurred year-to-date as well as the current business. One thing to keep in mind, you are right in terms of we have easier overlaps in Q3 and Q4 this year than we had in the first half but also those Q3 and Q4 were overlapping double-digit same-store sales from the year before that. For example, in Q4 2007 we were up 16% same-store sales. It was one of the periods when we were really -- the economy was really flying there. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "We had, you know, in terms of the macros and trying to get at what you are getting at I think, Joe, is the only thing that we can find, because certainly the macros in China look really good on some of the more industrial kind of side of the economy, but when you look at consumer confidence actually it\u2019s kind of bumping along the bottom, so that might be a reasonably good indicator of the consumer side of the equation. And then also consumer savings deposits are actually increasing at a pretty rapid rate, so there\u2019s -- at least there\u2019s no -- if that one particular indicator is no sign of the consumers opening up their pocketbooks on a fairly decent pace.  ", "", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and last question -- could you talk about check versus traffic, what you saw in this quarter and what kind of pricing or price laps you have coming up in the second half?", "Tim Jerzyk", "We did lose two to three points of pricing in March, so at the beginning of the second quarter in China. And then we\u2019ll lose -- right now all we are carrying is about 2.5, 3, and that will roll off in a month and we don\u2019t plan any new pricing. Check is actually about flat in China. U.S., $4.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so the down 4 is really all traffic in the second quarter?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Correct. ", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right, thank you. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Joe. Next question please, Rachel. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. ", "", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. I\u2019ll throw one more on China, then a follow-up on commodities -- you\u2019ve been reticent in China to discount, or more reticent maybe than McDonald\u2019s has. Does a protracted downturn there in the consumer change your view on how you want to drive traffic in that business going forward? Or maybe you could just review where you stand in kind of a promotional strategy in China?", "David C. Novak", "Well first of all, I think we have very strong everyday value going in, so we think our value equation is good. We are doing some snackable type products at the low-end to provide even more value for the second half of the year but we feel good about our overall proposition. ", "The thing about China which is so powerful is our unit economics are fantastic. We continue to have great unit economics at the sales levels that we\u2019re at and we are obviously going to do whatever we can to get the same-store sales up. But the big driver for China over the long-term is going to be the opening of the new units, which we think we are in the very early innings on with returns that I don\u2019t think anybody else in the industry has anywhere. ", "So we are very bullish on China over the long-term and we\u2019ll continue to push for both same-store sales and system sales growth through the new units. And the other thing that I think is very powerful for us is that when we look at our brand measures, you know, the regard for the brand across all the key measures, we are as strong if not stronger than ever. So as we go forward, the China equation is very, very strong. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Great, and then Rick, can you just go through the commodity outlook for the back half of the year by region? What are you expecting in terms of inflation or deflation in each of the three major regions in the back half? And maybe if you could compare that to what you thought at the beginning of the year?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, clearly as I said, commodities have been much more favorable than what we thought would happen at the beginning of the year. China in the back half of the year, we could expect $50 million of deflation, primarily led by chicken and oil would be the second biggest item to that. ", "In the U.S., we expect deflation of about $10 million and that\u2019s pretty much across the board benefit, except chicken -- chicken we actually have a slight inflation in the back half of the year. ", "And then, if you look at YRI, they have not benefited from the same type of commodity deflation. We\u2019ve had about 5% increases year-to-date. We expect probably something similar in the balance of the year, as we have a lot of long-term contracts there. Hopefully we\u2019ll see some benefit in that business at the very end of this year and going into next year. ", "We have some other information -- ", "Tim Jerzyk", "There is some information in the release as well, John, so if you are looking for anything specific, that pretty well covers it. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Seigner with Credit Suisse.", "Keith Seigner - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. A quick question on the change in guidance for the proceeds from the refranchising program -- I mean, it looks like the number of units estimated to be refranchised is the same but the proceeds are coming down. Can you talk about -- is this related to maybe changing market conditions, is it changing mix of units to be sold? Any color behind that would be helpful. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "It\u2019s a little bit of mix but some of it is just as credit has tightened, that\u2019s had some impact on pricing, so it is probably driven more by market forces than mix. There is some impact of mix. ", "Keith Seigner - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and then just a quick question on the uses of your free cash -- you continue to build cash balances, you know, it looks like during the quarter really the only major outlay was an $86 million contribution to the pension plan. You know, you\u2019ve got low interest rates on most of your debt. The bond holders don\u2019t really want to seem to sell. What\u2019s your prioritization for the free cash as you go into the second half in terms of more pension plan contributions, maybe debt reduction, repurchases? Prioritization on that would help. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "We actually did pretty well with the -- it was a tale of -- there were two sides to it. The bond tender we actually did pretty well. We wanted to -- we made an offer for $150 million. We got $137 million, so that was good but we did find there was a pretty good contingent of folks out there that like to hold their bonds. ", "But we have a number of ways that we can continue to reduce our debt. That\u2019s going to be our focus. We want to add a degree of even more strengthening to our balance sheet than where we feel we are today. We want to make sure we are in great shape. We don\u2019t have any nearer maturities. We don\u2019t have anything until 2011 but we were planning to win, when we get into that time frame and you know, it\u2019s really difficult to try to predict what that conditions of the credit markets are going to be, so we want to be in really good shape at that point. ", "We are always going to look at share buy-back but at this time, we don\u2019t anticipate any. You are seeing the other side of it, reducing our debt and our interest expense is coming down. ", "Keith Seigner - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. A couple of follow-ups on China and then another question -- I guess, Rick, just going back to the guidance for a second, can you maybe just drill down a little bit for us how May and I know June falls into the third quarter, how that has been trending? In your prepared remarks, you talked about a two-year trend still holding up very much positive. Is your guidance in the back half reflective of what you are seeing in the business today such that your June comp is back to on that flattish range? Can you maybe drill down for us on that?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Regarding May, May was positive but not as positive as we hoped it would be. The full-year guidance really reflects several factors -- one, it reflects what\u2019s happened year-to-date. Secondly, it does reflect trends and what we\u2019ve seen so far. And third obviously reflects our best judgment of what\u2019s going to happen from an economic standpoint -- very hard to forecast, as we\u2019ve said. ", "We\u2019re not going to share what the trends are within this current quarter. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, what about trends, the disparity of same-store sales between the different tiers of cities -- tier one, tier two, tier three? Was there a big notable difference?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Not so much in tiered cities as much between the export markets and the non-export markets. The export markets are probably running several [inaudible] below the non-export markets, with certain cities being impacted more than that. ", "You know, one of the interesting trends in China has been where the economic growth has been and where it\u2019s going to be and there\u2019s sort of three broad geographies in China that sometimes people use -- the coastal, central, and west. And right now, 75%, roughly 75% of our units are in the coastal area and 25% are in the central and west. The population has 50% coastal area and 50% in the central and west combined. And what we expect to do is to continue to have more development in the central and west parts of the business, both new unit development and my guess is same-store sales may trend that way too. Obviously it depends on our development pace. ", "As an example though, while central and west are only 25% of our existing units and 50% of the population, in 2009 we\u2019ve shifted so that now they are almost 40% of our new unit development. So what we are able to do because we are in 550 cities is we are able to take advantage of the higher growth in the west and central, so I think that is sort of probably the trend that we are going to be pushing in China over the next several years, taking advantage of what we think is going to happen to their economy. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then one question on the U.S. on Pizza Hut -- clearly a challenging quarter. I know you guys are very much looking forward to going national with the Wing Street launch later in the second half. You do have Wing Street I think in nearly 2,000 stores at this point. Is there any notable difference between the comp trends in those stores that have the Wing Streets versus those that do not?", "David C. Novak", "Well, I think that -- I don\u2019t think we have a significant difference in the comps on an ongoing basis but the mix continues to be solid on the Wing Street stores. What we do see is we do obviously when we introduce Wing Street, it does provide a lift. We are very bullish about the strategy that we have at Pizza Hut to move beyond pizza to include both pasta and Wing Street. You know, we really believe that that extra variety is going to give us an opportunity to change an overall category that\u2019s been pretty sluggish the last 10 years. ", "We\u2019ve got a great asset base that is under-leveraged and we think with the combination of the pasta and the chicken to go along with our pizza, we are going to have many more weapons in our arsenal to get the sales and bring in new occasions over the long-term. The big challenge that we have is to build awareness of these new segments and to drive incremental occasions, which we are working very hard to get done. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, I\u2019ll just sneak one last one in there as a follow-up to the commodity question -- Rick, what you laid out for the second half for China in the U.S., the favorability, is the third quarter or the fourth quarter going to be the quarter which sees the disproportionate benefit? Thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Right now our estimate is the third quarter will have more of the benefit. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "That\u2019s true for the U.S. and China. Rachel, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Thanks very much. A few questions -- first in China, can you give us a sense of how the KFC business did versus the Pizza Hut business in terms of same-store sales in the quarter?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Pizza Hut performed better than KFC did in the second quarter. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Okay. And separately, I think your U.S. margin guidance, you did about 155 basis points of margin expansion I believe in the first half in the U.S. You\u2019re saying I think at least one point in the second half. That does imply less margin expansion in the back half of \u201909. I\u2019m just wondering if you can comment maybe on some of the things that might make margin expansion less so in the second half versus the first half. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "In the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll start to get less benefit from pricing. As a reminder, in 2008 we took pricing continually through the year and so by the fourth quarter, most of it had been taken by the fourth quarter so the rollover on pricing diminishes in the fourth quarter of this year. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Okay, and if I can keep going, on Pizza Hut, just to revisit that, you do have the positives now, you do have Wing Street rolling out, so in terms of the down 8, is it the base pizza business? Can you maybe discuss the buckets or Wing Street stores on a comparable basis comping positive?", "Richard T. Carucci", "No, as David said, the benefit we\u2019ve gotten from Wing Street has generally been when we\u2019ve introduced it, so we don\u2019t see big differences in the comps. Now that could change once we have enough scale to nationally advertise the product, so we have very high intent on making this a winning sales layer for Pizza Hut long-term. ", "But we didn\u2019t see any huge differences in the comps between those stores and regular stores in the second quarter. ", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. The question is on the U.S. G&A cuts -- you know, as we get more into 2009 and you are evidently realizing $60 million of cuts, I mean, could you I guess give a little bit more illumination in terms of how you\u2019ve actually cut your cost structure, what you\u2019ve actually done and what confidence that you have that you\u2019ve done the right things from a business perspective, from a top line perspective in those cuts? And you certainly put that in the context of whether in 2010 you might need to add costs back or whether there might be even some more cost cuts to come in 2010 as the level of company ownership continues to come down. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yeah, again as a reminder to what we did at the back-end of 2009, the 2008 and 2009 is we were looking at our refranchising story and we were anticipating what the sizes of our businesses would be at the end of that period. And traditionally we had a lag between when we refranchise restaurants and when we reduce the G&A. And so what ended up happening is we sort of challenged ourselves and said can we reduce some of this G&A in anticipation of refranchising? And for example, the field type stuff we know has to occur with refranchising, things like area coaches, payroll, clerks, et cetera. So those position get -- directly follow refranchising. However, if you look at functions like marketing, headquarter folks, et cetera, we\u2019re saying we probably need fewer people ultimately because it takes less to support a franchise business than a company-owned business. So that\u2019s what we do. We basically did headcount reductions, mostly at the U.S. level and in shared services level and anticipation of that. We\u2019re comfortable with what we did. ", "As we go forward, we do expect to see some G&A reductions because field type positions will still get reduced when we refranchise restaurants but it won\u2019t be nearly as dramatic as the changes that we made at the end of 2008 and 2009. ", "In terms of planning for 2010, you know, obviously we are going to be doing that starting now, balance of year and we\u2019ll position ourselves in the best way possible but we don\u2019t have any concrete plans at this stage. ", "David C. Novak", "John, the only thing I would add to that would be two things -- one is we reinvested back in operations, in particularly KFC because we felt we had a real opportunity to do even better there. The other thing is that there\u2019s no question in all of our division presidents, we now have a better, stronger organization than we had last year, more focused. We eliminate a lot of activity and we\u2019ve been focused on action, so I think we\u2019re very, very confident in our organizational structure to deliver results. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thank you for that. And just follow-up -- Rick, at the tail-end of your prepared remarks, you talked about equipment investment, necessary equipment investment that might be part of the future and to my memory, the ovens or the grills, whatever you want to call them at KFC, was a fairly unique phenomenon for Yum! to basically pay for the equipment of a franchisee. I mean, is that -- are you eluding that there might be similar type of programs in the future that you might be paying for for the franchisees in order to get new products into the systems? ", "Richard T. Carucci", " I guess what I was eluding to is that we are investing, both us and our franchisees are investing in these times and so in general, the difference between layers of new product developments though is often there is some piece of equipment that\u2019s involved. So for example, beverages, you need different beverage equipment, as we do crushers in Yum! Restaurants International. Similar to when we did Fruitista products at Taco Bell, we needed those types of equipment. ", "So when we do Wing Street, that involves new equipment and some signage as well, so we\u2019re just saying we\u2019re going to continue doing those types of things. We\u2019re not insinuating that we are going towards a different model for how we fund it. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "But will you be buying that equipment for the franchisees as you did with the ovens at KFC?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Doubtful. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. All right, great. ", "David C. Novak", "Very doubtful. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please, Rachel.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Thank you. Two questions -- one, I just wonder if you can give a little more color on Taco Bell, which I guess represents the -- well, more than 50% of the U.S. profits and the last quarter you talked about how it was slowing a little bit perhaps due to some of your closest quick service tiers kind of getting into your face in terms of more the value push and we\u2019ve only seen that escalate since then. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pressure you are seeing from your peers with the dollar price point, how you guys are responding to that and what you are seeing most recently in terms of those trends. ", "David C. Novak", "I think it\u2019s pretty much a continuation of our conversation we had last quarter. I mean, the Taco Bell brand does stand for number one in value but we definitely have to weather the storm of everybody else getting into their dollar menus. And we don\u2019t see that changing for the balance of the year and I think that makes it a lot tougher for Taco Bell than when there\u2019s only three or four concepts that are making that their everyday message. But that is the everyday message for all the chains right now, so we definitely are under more pressure. ", "But the brand remains strong, we have lots of ideas in terms of how we are going to keep it going, we are going to continue to focus on our why pay more menu, and bring news to that, plus we are working on some major, major sales layers over the long-term. ", "You know, I think that there\u2019s no question when you just look at the U.S. business, we\u2019re in a transformative stage I think for each one of our businesses. You know, with Pizza Hut, it\u2019s obviously to move beyond pizza to pasta and chicken, and we\u2019re absolutely convinced that\u2019s going to allow us to get more incremental occasions over the long-term. ", "At KFC, we needed to address our number one issue, which is people moving away from fried foods, so we added a new oven platform. And we are very confident that we\u2019ve made the right move with Kentucky Grilled Chicken and it\u2019s going to sustain and we have a much bigger and more popular and more appealing product base to grow from as we go forward. ", "With Taco Bell, we\u2019ve got I think the most charismatic brand in the category where the heavy fast food user absolutely loves the brand. We have outstanding unit economics. You know, we can really grow this business. I think the thing that we are really focused on is adding big new sales layers that will improve our unit economics so that we can open up more units in the United States, which we think is a distinct possibility. So the things that you really can\u2019t see in the marketplace are the things frankly that we\u2019re most excited about over the long-term, whether it\u2019s figuring out how to build a significant dinner business to the new approach that we have to going into breakfast, which we put into some stores that we are seeing some good initial results on. ", "You know, these are the things that I think are truly going to change the game for a concept that\u2019s already strong. But what we really need to do across the board is we\u2019re looking for another $100,000, $200,000 in sales. We don\u2019t want to keep these businesses the way they have been the last 10 years. We want to truly change the game. That\u2019s why with pasta and chicken at Pizza Hut, we can truly change the game. That\u2019s why having a non-fried platform at KFC, we can truly change the game. ", "[That\u2019s why] we\u2019re working on these major new sales layers across the board, which are also traveling around the world. So we\u2019re -- by getting these new sales layers in, developed, tested, we are much better positioned for the future and I think this year, there is no question this is a hunker down, you know, tough sales year. ", "But the one thing I do know is we are delivering the bacon on the profit side and we are definitely strengthening these brands for long-term success. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Actually, could I just follow-up on that -- you mentioned KFC was in there and I think it\u2019s worth a couple of interesting statistics in your prepared remarks, just has a 30-point swing in comps versus the -- could you just give more color on the grilled chicken and what that did to the comps as it was rolled out and kind of what it\u2019s running now?", "David C. Novak", "Well, I think that pretty much tells you what happened. I mean, we were down close to double-digits and when we first launched the product, in the first month we had a huge turnaround in the sales. And I think that -- you know, I always say that any time you can solve the biggest of problem, the biggest problem that a brand has that occurred that\u2019s the most important problem that the brand has, you are going to see big-time lifts in sales. Years ago we saw that with Taco Bell when we -- our biggest problem was portability, and we introduced the quesadilla as a hot new handheld and the grilled stuffed burrito as a heavy duty portable and the crunchwrap is good to go. ", "For KFC, it\u2019s that people are reducing their consumption of fried foods and this was the single biggest barrier that we had to keep our brand from being used more frequently and we communicated in extremely powerful fashion with great advertising, great promotion, also had the benefit of Oprah basically endorsing the product and this has been a tremendous vehicle to help us turn the business around. ", "And the consumer responded overwhelmingly positive, and the feedback that we are getting on this product, anecdotally and quantitatively, is that we\u2019ve got a product line that we can really build on going forward. So I couldn\u2019t be more excited with the initial results with this launch and the fact that it\u2019s 40% of our chicken on the bone business tells us that we definitely hit a chord with our customer, and a chord that we are going to be able to sustain and grow over time. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "And just as a reminder, in David\u2019s comments, he said after the initial introduction that sales had flattened but again, remember we came into this off of a Q1 with minus 7% sales, and we are doing better than that now.

", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citi.", "Analyst for Greg Badishkanian - Citi", "This is Jeff on for Greg. We got cut off, so I apologize if I ask a question that was already asked -- in terms of the YRI business, it looks like some of your big franchise only markets had seen a bit of a sequential slowing this quarter versus last. Could you maybe just give an update on whether the global recession is now becoming more widespread in your view, or kind of what\u2019s going on there?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well you know, amazingly, the YRI business has held up and part of that could be we are a little bit more skewed towards developing economies and those businesses and economies have held up. But as David also said in his remarks, some of our mature businesses have performed very well in some difficult economies, reflecting I think the strength of the management teams there and our competitive position. ", "So that business is roughly -- has held up well. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "You have to keep in mind you did have the calendar impacts, so the Q1 numbers were a little bit -- obviously benefited from that and Q2 was hurt by that a little bit, so you almost kind of need to look at it on a year-to-date basis. ", "Analyst for Greg Badishkanian - Citi", "Okay, and then just quickly turning back to the U.S., and KFC, are most of the customers on grilled chicken, are they mostly lapsed users or have you seen quite a bit of incremental new customers coming in?", "David C. Novak", "Well, everybody\u2019s basically tried KFC, so -- so I think to some extent, they are either our current users or more lapsed users. So we\u2019ve brought people back into the franchise that weren\u2019t there but I think 25%, at least 25% of the -- excuse me, I\u2019m sorry -- 40% of the users are lapsed. So we are getting major retrial of the brand and we are only at 20%, so we have a huge opportunity -- 20% trial, so we have a huge opportunity to continue to drive this business. ", "Analyst for Greg Badishkanian - Citi", "Would you expect future promotions on that to kind of -- ", "David C. Novak", "No, we\u2019re -- part of our problem right now I think is to a certain extent, we had a calendar that was already set to move off of the grilled chicken focus a little bit more prematurely than I think what we should have, so we will be hammering home Kentucky Grilled Chicken for a long time to come, plus we have a significant amount of product news coming off of that base product line. So we have a lot of opportunity to generate even more news as we go forward and you\u2019ll see us being -- featuring grilled chicken in all of our promotions, so everything now will have both a fried and a grilled twist, so you can basically get KFC any way you like it. ", "Analyst for Greg Badishkanian - Citi", "Great. Thanks so much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Forte with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Thomas Forte - Telsey Advisory Group", "Great. Thank you very much. So first off, congratulations on the successful launch of the Kentucky Grilled Chicken. And then second, it seems like there\u2019s an emerging price point in the QSR space with $5, so you have the dollar menu items and then you have the $5 price point, kind of started by Subway and continued by others. I wanted to know if you could give us your thoughts on your ability, especially at KFC and Pizza Hut, to make money on the $5 price point, and then what impact commodities have on the ability to do so?", "David C. Novak", "Well, we don\u2019t think we have any issue at all with that $5 price point. In fact, we\u2019re doing $5 box meals right now at KFC. We\u2019ve got the Big Eats, Tiny Price menu at Pizza Hut at $5. And you know, we are very confident that we can be competitive on the value front going forward. ", "Thomas Forte - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Just a couple quick ones -- one, was there any impact on the U.S. margins from the grilled chicken rollout? Was it a heavy quarter from a marketing standpoint that would affect timing and margins in the quarter?", "David C. Novak", "Most of our advertising, almost all of our advertising, is formulaic in the sense that it\u2019s contracted -- contractual driven, and so we just -- you know, that would not have affected our margins and remember with Kentucky Grilled Chicken, another reason why it\u2019s very popular, not only with our customers but with our franchisees is the margins are actually better on a grilled piece of chicken versus a fried piece of chicken. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "And there was no impact from the giveaways around Oprah and things like that?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We had some impact on that on the franchise expense. Some of the extra mailing costs of handling the rebate, so we picked up for the system but it didn\u2019t impact margins, as David talked about. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and then just on China, just so I\u2019m clear, you said the pricing was plus 2.5 in the second quarter and the check was flattish?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Correct. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and so then that implies the traffic was down 6%, 7% in the back half. You guys are assuming that kind of returns to flattish kind of numbers?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Well, you lose pricing -- what pricing we have remaining, which is 2.5 to 3 points, drops off in a month. So after that, what you see in same-store sales or not is transactions. And right now, average check is flat and in U.S. dollar terms is at $4. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. Got it, thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wilson with Tiburon Research.", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Yes, thank you. Last quarter you provided the monthly comp store sales in Mainland China. I was wondering if you could provide those again this quarter. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "No, we\u2019re not going to do that. ", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Why not?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Because our policy is not to provide monthly numbers and the reason we did it last time is we thought there was a very unusual trend going on that we thought was correct this year. ", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Okay. Could you provide us some directional information on trend -- I guess ticket and transaction counts in the U.S. for the three brands in the quarter?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Basically what we can tell you is that guest check for all three brands was roughly flat. So then you can go back to the comps that Rick -- we had negative 8 at Pizza Hut, plus 3 at KFC, and plus 1 at Taco Bell, and guest check was flat. ", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Okay. And then finally, last quarter, Rick, you talked about a two-year trend or a run-rate in China. You seemed confident in planning comps going forward using that two-year trend. Today you are talking about a three-year trend. I guess how much confidence should we have that you are going achieve your sales plan in China?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, if we were to look at basically flat sales for Mainland China, we\u2019re lapping over positive same-store sales in both the third and fourth quarter, so you\u2019d still be two-year positive. ", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Okay, but last quarter you were confident about a two-year trend being around 14%. Today you are talking about a three-year trend. You are going back a couple of years, so I\u2019m just wondering how much confidence you have in your forecast. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, as we said, it\u2019s a very difficult environment for forecasting right now, so especially when you get towards to the back-end of the -- the very back-end of the year, so I think anybody in this environment who is confident about forecasting, I\u2019d be surprised at. ", "Rob Wilson - Tiburon Research", "Fair enough. Thanks for taking my call. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Liebowitz with Horizon Capital Management.", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "Good morning. You made reference early on about obtaining the number one position in the Chinese breakfast market. A, how large would that figure be? And B, to accomplish it, how many units do you have to open incremental to what is already there?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well again, keep in mind now most of our units, and this didn\u2019t -- this wasn\u2019t the case before the last 12 months but most of our units now serve breakfast, so about 90% of them. So we\u2019ve now -- and that number was only 50% a couple of years ago, so we\u2019ve already expanded it to most of the units. So what it really needs to do is to build up the habit of eating breakfast at a place like KFC, and we\u2019re making progress, steady progress on that as we\u2019ve had I think some good new product introductions. So just keep working on what we are doing now. ", "David C. Novak", "I think the big thing is that we only have like 5% mix right now and we are really creating a category, you know, and what we haven\u2019t done is we haven\u2019t spent as much effort up against expanding the menu and advertising on television, and those are opportunities as we go forward. But we think preemptively, we can be the absolute leader in QSR in breakfast in China and there\u2019s no reason in the world that longer term, we can\u2019t have 20% to 25% to 30% mix of breakfast and have a very profitable day part. Already in Hong Kong, for example, we have 15% mix. ", "So we have a real opportunity to build a big business in that arena and nobody is going to beat us to it. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "And how large is that? In other words, to be number one, what are the dollar revenues you need?", "David C. Novak", "Well, I don\u2019t even know what the -- ", "Tim Jerzyk", "It\u2019s an emerging category. ", "David C. Novak", "It\u2019s an emerging category. It\u2019s more of an up-side for us as we go forward. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "Well that said, how do you know when you will be number one? How do we make this determination if we don\u2019t have any idea of the size of the breakfast market in China?", "David C. Novak", "Okay, well, maybe we can always go back and try to give you a better handle on that but I\u2019ll be sure to tell you when we\u2019re number one. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "Do we have a timeframe, a time horizon on that -- three years, five-year, whatever?", "David C. Novak", "No, what we do is we set a target out there and we -- what we want to do is get there the right way. See, the big thing we\u2019re trying to do in China is keep building the premiere brand in China and keep polishing the apple, okay? And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll never move too fast in China but we\u2019ll move with our people capability, you know, that\u2019s why we will make sure that we build a day part the right way and make sure we have the right balance between the different day parts. We\u2019ve just got a cherry business there, okay, with unit economics in China that are very similar to the kind of unit economics that McDonald\u2019s has here in the U.S. -- where McDonald\u2019s has 12,000 traditional units and we only have 3,000 KFCs. ", "So we\u2019re just -- you know, we know in a country where you already have 300 million people in the middle class that we are going to have at least that many KFCs some day and we are on a march to get there the right way, and that\u2019s -- and getting there the right way seems to us like we ought to have a hell of a breakfast business. You know, nobody else has one and why don\u2019t we lead there like we\u2019ve led in every other day part in China? And so we are going to get there the right way and stay after it. ", "So we are very confident in what we are doing in China, not only with KFC but with Pizza Hut and the big thing we want to do in China is just keep improving on the already great unit economics that we have. And so you build a home delivery business with KFC, you build a breakfast business with KFC, you\u2019re going to be adding significant dollars to your already high average unit volumes and the unit economics usually go up when that happens. ", "So that will allow us to continue to open up more and more restaurants, but even off the current population base in China, you know, we think we can get well over 12,000 restaurants in China. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "And one other unrelated item -- turning to Pizza Hut, what percentage of your revenue would you like to obtain from pasta and chicken over the next three years?", "David C. Novak", "I would say that a good mix on that over time would be at least 30%. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "And will this be as profitable on your pretax line as pizza is right now at that point, three years out?", "David C. Novak", "It would be similar. It would be similar. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "And would it also have the similar demographic of eat-in versus take-out?", "David C. Novak", "Most of our business is take-out and delivery. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "So you would expect the same ratio though for these items?", "David C. Novak", "Yes. ", "David Liebowitz - Horizon Capital Management", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Jeff Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. I just had one more question on China -- I was wondering if you could talk to the pace of unit development, opportunities and constraints around that pace of unit development in terms of people and real estate, and perhaps maybe an update on recent new unit performance in China. Thanks. ", "David C. Novak", "Well, I think first of all, I would say that we\u2019ve got tremendous process and discipline around the growth and returns of our new units. We monitor our returns very closely each quarter. Our new unit cash-on-cash pay-back for KFCs in China is, as we\u2019ve said before, is in the two- to three-year range. Our average new unit volumes are about $1 million a year. We get cash margins of  25% and it only cost us $500,000 to $600,000 to basically put the -- get the unit up and running. ", "You know, we really believe very much that you\u2019ve got to have strong operating capability to really get returns in this business. The good news for us in China is we have restaurant general managers ready to go in many of our existing restaurants today. So we\u2019re not, as I mentioned before, we\u2019re not in any race in China. We don\u2019t want to get ahead of any of our capabilities and we do have great people capability there to put up some big numbers and we are -- we continue to do that. ", "I think the other thing is that we are continuing to expand and building our competitive advantage and the breadth of our geography where we are in 550 cities, and we are going to continue to our pace of development as long as we generate high returns. You know, where we see weaker returns, we will like we have in Shanghai, okay, we\u2019ve cut back a little bit in Shanghai and shifted some of our focus. At KFC, we\u2019ve seen more of a modest shift to more of the central and the west region of China versus the more economically constrained markets, the export areas. And I think we\u2019ve got great discipline on this and we are in the early, early innings. ", "Jeff Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. ", "David C. Novak", "Okay. Well, thank you very much. You know, I think that anybody that\u2019s followed us would know that there\u2019s probably nobody any harder on ourselves than ourselves. You know, we\u2019d obviously like to have better sales today but I have to tell you, when I look at the situation, I look at our company, the kind of profits that we will be generating this year versus a lot of other companies, not only in our industry but in other industries. I\u2019m very proud of the team and the results that we are generating around the world. ", "In total, we expect to hit our 10% earnings per share growth this year with solid operating profit growth and just as importantly, and I want to emphasize that we intend on keeping this going in 2010. ", "You know, our global brands and our global development machine, the fact that we do have -- we are global, the fact that we do have this global development machine continues to make us not your ordinary restaurant company. ", "You know, we are fixated. I mean, fixated on the three drivers that we know that drive shareholder value in any retail company. You know, new units -- we\u2019re the number one international unit developer in the world today. Nobody in retail tops us. Same-store sales -- we are building and investing in major new sales layers which are improving our brand positions over the long-term and will allow us to drive same-store sales growth in our existing assets and continually improve our unit economics. And return on invested capital -- and of course, we are focused as ever on being the industry leader, being an industry leader and return on invested capital and continuing to grow our global cash machine. ", "So when you look at retail and you think okay, how about new units? I\u2019d say Yum!'s doing a pretty damn good job. How about same-store sales? That\u2019s where we have the most work to do and we are working very hard on the sales layers and we see significant opportunity over the long-term with our asset base and return on invested capital, I think we have a pretty good track record. ", "So as we go forward, we believe the Yum! model is intact and is getting stronger, and all of our businesses are working on things that are going to make them better around the world. ", "So thank you very much, appreciate you being on the call. ", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin your conference. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.

Registration is required and you will be receiving more information on the conference very soon so keep that date on hold. Second, our next earnings release, Wednesday, February 3, 2010 will be for our fourth quarter earnings and will be released that day after the close. ", "On our call today you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak. ", "David C. Novak", "Thank you, Tim. I appreciate it very much. This is a big week at Yum! Brands. This is our Founder\u2019s Day week that we are celebrating our 12th anniversary since we were spun off from PepsiCo and I am very pleased to report that our global portfolio delivered a 15% increase in operating profit for the third quarter before special items, including impressive 32% growth in China and 18% growth in the United States. ", "As a result  of our year-to-date profit performance, we are raising our full-year 2009 EPS growth forecast to 12%. ", "Our growth this quarter was driven by continued development of high return, new units in China and cost savings in our U.S. business, as well as substantial commodity deflation. These factors more than offset generally sluggish same-store sales performance.   ", "Importantly, our China and Yum! Restaurants International businesses remain on track to open over 1,400 international new units this year. We believe this development will continue to lead the industry and provide us with even stronger competitive positions in high growth developing markets. ", "Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I am obviously very proud of our China team\u2019s performance. Our China division generated operating profit growth of 32% and margins over 23%. We remain on track to deliver at least 475 new units in Mainland China this year. Now remember, our new unit development provides a cash pay-back of less than three years. ", "Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China -- KFC continue to be the largest western QSR concept in Mainland China with over 2700 units in over 600 cities and average unit volumes of $1.4 million. Importantly, China continues to be a leader in executing our long-term strategy to develop new, incremental sales layers. We have established new proteins beyond chicken to now offer fish and beef. We are also steadily expanding KFC into new day parts, including breakfast and delivery. ", "We now have a national breakfast offering that features western and typical Chinese items. This gives us a great base to establish a whole new day part. We intend to win at breakfast and drive sales mix from 5% today to at least [20%] sales mix over time. ", "We have also established KFC delivery in over 90 cities and nearly 600 units. This sales layer gives us the ability to grow our catering and dinner day part, which typically have a higher ticket average. We are confident we are on the ground floor of both of these big opportunities. ", "Importantly, our KFC consumer brand position has never been stronger. We lead in important measures like value for the money, great taste, convenience and speed, as well as variety of choices. No question -- KFC is in the enviable position of being a leading brand growing in both stature and size in this all-important China market. ", "Many of you may be surprised to learn that our Pizza Hut casual dining brand is the number one casual dining chain in China and also outside the United States. We continue to build a significant lead in the western casual dining category with 442 units in over 100 cities. A new enhanced menu has helped us increase average unit volumes while driving margins to record levels. The improved menu includes new entrees with beef, chicken, and shrimp, along with a wide variety of appetizers, beverages, and desserts. ", "Additionally, we improved our pizza value on the low-end to provide broader appeal. Our tea time beverage and dessert program continues to drive snacking and mid-afternoon sales. This is consistent with our goal to use the asset throughout the day, which will ultimately include breakfast. ", "We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands in Mainland China. Pizza Hut home service now has 87 units in 11 cities. We will grow as consumer demand for convenience is inevitable in this segment. ", "East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand with 19 units, is now generating sales that are roughly 85% the level of a typical KFC, which means we have a powerful concept. We are excited about the recent opening of our first central kitchen which will help us get to scaleable economics. We will keep you posted on both of these emerging concepts. ", "Bottom line, I couldn\u2019t be happier with the progress we are making executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. ", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where we are aggressively driving expansion and building strong brands in the more than 110 countries that we are in. Here\u2019s why we are so excited about YRI -- number one, over 85% of the nearly 13,000 restaurants in this division are franchise units which generate a steady growing stream of franchise royalties. Number two, this business is a consistent development machine. This will be the ninth year we\u2019ve opened more than 700 new restaurants and this year we\u2019ll open at least 900. And number three, we are the overall market leader in the high growth developing economies and our lead is increasing every year. ", "While our long-term growth prospects have never been better, our third quarter sales did slow down. Operating profit growth for the quarter was flat. Excluding foreign currency translation, driven by poor performance in two company markets, Mexico and South Korea. Just like China and everywhere in Yum!, we are aggressively going after sales layers -- in particular, KFC, our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International, is making major progress on Crushers, our proprietary line of frozen beverages. We entered the year with just 100 test units having Crushers and we will exit 2009 with at least 2,000 units. We expect to expand to 5,000 units by the end of the year. At that point, our new highly incremental beverage sales layer will be in over 60% of Yum! Restaurants International\u2019s KFC units. ", "KFC also continues to develop other new incremental sales layers. We already have individual markets successfully executing non-fried chicken, breakfast, and seafood products. We are committed to making each of these initiatives global over time. ", "Pizza Hut is pursuing the same strategy as China to broaden and enhance our casual dining menu in Yum! Restaurants International markets. We have seen the benefit of this initiative in several countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Central America. We are definitely in the process of elevating our positioning to become a true mainstream casual dining brand around the world. ", "Yum! Restaurants International has a great base business and we are bullish about our new unit opportunities in developing economies like India, Russia, Brazil, and Vietnam. I am heading off in a couple of weeks to India where KFC is starting to take off and Taco Bell is getting ready to open the first unit. We will tell you more about India and these countries at our annual investor conference in December. ", "But today, I would like to simply highlight South Africa, a country I recently visited. In this country, KFC has a significant brand leadership position with a 4-to-1 lead versus western competition. It is an all-franchise business with over 550 units. Our unit economics are similar to China and the brand is arguably the strongest consumer brand in the country. ", "South Africa is a great example of how much our company has changed over the past 12 years. South Africa wasn\u2019t even on our radar screen when we made roughly $4 million when we started this company. This year, we expect to make over $40 million and when I was there, I saw new units in downturn Johannesburg, suburban areas, townships, and rural areas and it is so inspiring to see these brand new, beautiful KFCs and the jobs that we are creating in this developing country. ", "We are also building franchise relationships to expand beyond South Africa to countries like Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania. It\u2019s easy for us to envision that we will one day make more profits in countries across Africa than we do in KFC in the United States. ", "In summary, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. We have strong unit economics. We have substantial runway for growth in the emerging markets and I would like to take a moment to thank our strong franchise partners for the investment they continue to make and for partnering with us to build such a fantastic global business we can all be proud of. ", "Now before I move on to our U.S. business, I would also like to send my heartfelt support to our teams in Southeast Asia as they have faced significant natural disasters over the past week in Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Samoa. Our thoughts are with all the families that have been impacted by these tragic events. Only a few of our restaurants were impacted and we are working with our franchise partners to get them reopened as quickly as possible. ", "Next on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency, and returns. Our U.S. business achieved strong operating profit growth of 18% with substantial improvement in restaurant margins and significant G&A savings. This has more than offset a 6% same-store sales decline. ", "The U.S. team\u2019s focus on proactive restructuring and productivity, along with lower commodity costs, fueled this profit growth. Now Taco Bell and KFC same-store sales were down two points, roughly in line with the industry. Pizza Hut had a tough quarter with same-store sales down 13%. ", "Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the United States, continues to have the leading value position. We will continue to play to that strength with more exciting news on the why pay more menu with items like Blackjack Taco at $0.89. We believe the brand\u2019s sales are soft because everyone is now focusing on the value game and customers are obviously cutting back across the board. Nevertheless, we are confident our brand proposition has never been stronger and we are improving our operation majors -- everything from speed of service to order accuracy. We will kick off 2010 with our first national advertising of our Fresco line of products, nine great tasting products with nine grams of fat or less. Believe me, we are going to have some fun with the marketing that we are going to be doing and we will definitely break through the clutter. ", "In addition, our pipeline of new products for 2010 is full. Longer term, we are most excited about breakfast, which is off to a great start with our current test. ", "At KFC, Kentucky Grilled Chicken has been an un-qualified success. It started the process of transforming the brand by overcoming KFC\u2019s biggest barrier to frequency, people looking for more balanced choices. While our same-store sales were down 2% this quarter, we made major progress on building awareness in trial. We have driven awareness to 75% of quick service restaurant users and 60 million people have tried the product. We also continue to get rave reviews from customers who have enjoyed the product, so continuing to drive trial is our top job as we entice people to join what we call the Grilled Nation. We have brought back the $3.99 two-piece meal, arguably the best value in the category for a complete meal. ", "In summary, Kentucky Grilled Chicken was a major step in the right direction. The investment we have made in Kentucky Grilled Chicken will help us be much more competitive in 2010 and beyond. We needed to broaden the appeal of this brand and we have done it. ", "Pizza Hut in the United States is obviously struggling with a same-store sales decline of 13%. As you know, higher ticket premium products are under pressure in all categories. Pizza Hut is clearly premium priced in its category and is definitely paying the price for it. However, we believe the Pizza Hut brand is too good a brand to be performing this poorly. We need to offer better value and get more credit for our high quality offerings. We intend to get more price competitive at the local level. We will also continue to transform the brand from just pizza to pizza, pasta, and chicken. As a matter of fact, we just launched our first national advertising for our Wing Street brand of flavored wings and we\u2019ll grow this segment over time. ", "Going forward, we are confident in our strategy. The reality is that we have a lot of wood to chop as we establish our pizza value and make pasta and chicken incremental occasions. This is a big challenge. We are not happy with where we are at at Pizza Hut but we have a great team and we think they are up to making progress. ", "So let me wrap up the Yum! Brand\u2019s performance. This is a very difficult economic climate, so generating sales growth has been tough and may stay that way for a while. But in total, the profitability of our business is rock solid, as you\u2019ve seen from our year-to-date results. In fact, if someone would have told me at the beginning of the year that our company would end up with 12% EPS growth, open over 1,400 international new units, improve our margins around the world, drive profit growth in each of our divisions, make strategic progress developing new sales layers, and increase our dividend 11%, I would have said count me in, book it. Well, that\u2019s exactly what is happening in 2009. This performance gives us solid footing going forward and builds on our track record of at least 10% earnings per share growth that we have enjoyed for the last seven years. ", "Now let me hand it over to Rick to give you more details. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David and good morning, everyone. I am going to comment on three areas -- first, our third quarter results and balance of year expectations by business segment; second, our full-year outlook and our overall Yum! business; and third, an early perspective on 2010. ", "As we review our business segments, let\u2019s start with China. China division operating profit grew 32% and system sales grew 11%. This sales growth was fueled by new restaurant development as Mainland China same-store sales were flat. We saw growth in the central and western provinces offset by weakness in export impacted coastal provinces with a difference in sales comparisons of about five points. ", "Restaurant margin was over 23% in the third quarter, or 2.3 points above last year. This was driven by about $20 million in commodity deflation. As a reminder, we experienced high chicken commodity inflation in the third quarter of 2007. At that time, we took a price increase which only offset a portion of the cost increase because we expected prices to come back down. While it took longer than originally expected for these costs to decline, we are very pleased that China margins have returned to 2007 levels. ", "Now on to YRI -- system sales growth was 4% prior to for-ex translation, driven by new unit development. In 2009, we have seen strong same-store sales in most of the developing markets. This was generally true in the third quarter when as an example, KFC India was up over 20%. However, overall YRI same-store sales growth was flat due to a general softening of sales across most regions. ", "We were disappointed with flat operating profit growth excluding for-ex in YRI during the third quarter. We experienced weakness in the company-owned markets of Mexico and South Korea. In addition, third quarter profits were affected by the timing of division overhead expenses. ", "During the fourth quarter of \u201909, we expect similar sales but improved profits at YRI. YRI has not yet experienced the benefit of commodity decreases. We expect to see some benefit in the fourth quarter as some of our longer term contracts get renewed. In addition, we expect to benefit from timing issues on facility actions and overhead expenses. ", "While for-ex translation continues to negatively impact YRI\u2019s reporting results and growth rate in the third quarter, we actually expect little or no impact from for-ex in the fourth quarter. ", "Now to the United States, where our same-store sales performance was lower than expectations and declined by 6%. Taco Bell and KFC both saw declines of 2% and Pizza Hut declined 13%. Despite a decline in U.S. sales, we saw third quarter restaurant margin increase by over three full points. Commodity deflation was the primary driver with a $16 million reduction in the third quarter versus last year. Beyond that, each of our brands has been aggressively deriving productivity initiatives in the stores. This includes going after the basic blocking and tackling, like more efficiently opening our restaurants I the morning with reduced labor and energy consumption. ", "I would like to thank the operation teams for their cost focus and these savings do add up. ", "As previously communicated, U.S. profitability in 2009 will benefit from the restructuring completed in late 2008 and early 2009. There were $16 million in G&A savings for the third quarter, which was on top of $38 million of savings in the first half of the year. We remain on track to deliver at least $60 million for the full year. ", "We are quite proud of the efforts of our U.S. teams to achieve restaurant margin improvement and G&A reductions which led to Q3 operating profit growth of 18%. ", "With that said, we expect weak fourth quarter profits in the U.S. The sales trends have not gotten better and we anticipate less benefit from pricing and commodities than we experienced in the third quarter. These items all put downward pressure on our margins and we don\u2019t anticipate the improvements we have seen in the past four quarters to continue. ", "We will get a benefit from G&A cost reductions in the U.S. but the remaining benefit will be less than in the third quarter, so we now expect the fourth quarter to be the low point of the year for our U.S. business. ", "Prior to closing the books on the U.S., I would like to mention that our re-franchising program has continued to move forward. Although tight credit markets continue to slow transactions, we have refranchised over 350 restaurants as of today and remain on pace to achieve our full-year target of 500 units.       ", "To summarize the third quarter for Yum!, we had outstanding profit growth in China and the U.S. The EPS growth excluding special items of 21%, benefited from new unit development in China, G&A savings in the U.S., and lower commodity costs in both China and the U.S. businesses. This helped offset approximately $0.02 per share of negative for-ex translation impact for the quarter. In this tough environment, we were quite pleased with our third quarter results. ", "Now let me give you a few thoughts of our full-year results. Overall, 2009 has been a tough year to forecast and that theme continues. Nevertheless, our strong year-to-date profit performance has allowed us to increase our full-year guidance. Let me put our year-to-date results in perspective -- year-to-date, our operating profit growth before special items is 8%. This includes a for-ex downside of $53 million. Without this for-ex downside, our year-to-date operating profit is 13%, a result we are very proud of. ", "While we are benefiting from commodity upsides in 2009, let\u2019s remember that these are off of record increases in 2008. In the U.S. in 2008, we experienced about [$120 million] of commodity inflation. We expect about $20 million of deflation in 2009. ", "These two years combined provide average inflation of about $50 million per year, while a typical year of 2.5% inflation would result in about $30 million of inflation. ", "We increased our EPS guidance for the year to $2.14, or 12% growth, based on the strong year-to-date profit performance, along with a lower-than-expected full-year tax rate. We expect 2009 will mark our eighth straight year of double-digit EPS growth. ", "When we look back upon our track record, each year has been unique. In any one year, we meet or exceed expectations in many areas of the business and we usually face opportunities and challenges that we did not expect. However, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we consistently benefit from a resilient global business model led by strong management teams around the world. ", "Our leaders feel a high degree of accountability to deliver both annual financial performance and the long-term business value and that\u2019s exactly what is happening in 2009. ", "Finally, a few initial comments about 2010 -- by many people\u2019s estimation, 2010 will be another challenging year for the consumer. Whether that proves true or not, we are certainly planning our business as that will be the case. However, Yum! has a number of strengths that give us confidence that we will be able to extend our track record of strong financial growth. ", "Let me talk about a few of these advantages. First, as a company we deliver a significant [inaudible] growth from high growth new unit development in China and YRI. This has proven true for many years and 2010 should not be an exception. Our 2009 development of at least 1,400 new units outside the U.S. will provide a full-year benefit to profits in 2010. In addition, our development pipeline for the next year looks similar to what it looked like at this time last year. ", "Second, we just have a great business in China. China is a long way from the U.S. and I know that many people have not been able to see it with their own eyes and therefore may doubt the strength of this business. ", "There are some who may also doubt our ability to continue to grow it. However, let me summarize a few characteristics of our China business that are unique. First we have a huge presence advantage. KFC is the only western QSR brand in the vast majority of the 600 cities in which we have restaurants. Second, our competitive position continues to improve in key growing parts of the country. In 2009, we will add 140 KFC units in the central and western regions of China. More than half of our new unit KFC development will be in tier 3 through tier 6 cities. ", "In the central and west regions and in smaller tier cities, our lead versus competition is even greater. In these parts of the country, our cell phone distribution system, our large seasoned development team, and our strong regional operations leadership provide significant and ongoing strategic advantages. ", "Third, our economics in China are excellent -- as we have previously discussed, we have strong margins and great new unit economics. ", "Fourth, while I don\u2019t know when the China economy will improve, my guess is that it will strengthen before the rest of the world. ", "In our YRI business, you can look at the fact that earnings from our franchise business provide a very predictable profit stream and have a strong history of growth. When you put China and YRI together, we have a unique powerful global growth model. We believe we are very well-positioned to drive growth in 2010 and beyond. ", "In the U.S., we have a cash machine that has been strong and steady. We are also looking to improve sales performance at each of our brands. At the same time, we will continue to manage costs tightly. For 2010, we have already taken actions on our G&A structure. The cost savings we have already identified are enough to offset the roughly $20 million negative impact from refranchising as we move from a restaurant margin to a royalty. ", "We may have difficulty lapping the 2009 tax rate. However, we don\u2019t expect as much headwind from foreign currency translation in 2010. While it was difficult to forecast, we would actually see a benefit in 2010 if today\u2019s spot rates continue. ", "We are in the early stages of building our plans for 2010 to deliver 10% EPS growth. We will share these plans with you during our December 9th analyst meeting in New York. ", "To wrap up, we expect to deliver another successful year in 2009. We are well-positioned in 2010 when once again we expect to generate consistent financial performance, impressive global growth, strong free cash flow, and substantial returns to shareholders. ", "Back to you, David. ", "David C. Novak", "Okay, well, let\u2019s just turn it over for questions from the group. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Ashley, let\u2019s open up the queue for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with J.P. Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "David, I was hoping that you could comment on just your view of the YRI business -- you know, in general. I mean, the conversation that we\u2019ve had many times over the years is a stubbornly low and quite frankly declining store margin in that business and what would increasingly be suggesting that there probably aren\u2019t very many stores or certainly very many markets where Yum! as a corporation has earned the right to own, to use a phrase of your own. So if you can kind of put in the context expectations 2010, 2011 -- one, significant improvement in YRI company store margins, or secondly if you are considering a major plan of refranchising to basically get those stores to franchisees and presumably at this point might even look like a neutral to earnings or even accretive to earnings transaction.           ", "David C. Novak", "Well, I think first of all when we think our Yum! Restaurants International business is an absolute powerful engine for us going forward. I mean, the big driver that we have is a business here that is almost owned and operated 90% by franchisees, they are opening up close to 90% of -- this year it will be about 900 new units that we open, and that\u2019s the big driver of our overall profitability. ", "Longer term, we are very excited about the fact that we are pursuing the Yum! strategy of developing major new sales layers, so we expect to get even more profitability and more cash flow for our franchisees out of these units as we go forward with the launch of the breakfast, of the beverage program, Crushers. We are testing breakfast, we think that will be a long-term opportunity for us because there isn\u2019t a whole lot of competition other than McDonald\u2019s outside the United States in terms of western brands. ", "So we think the new units and the sales story over the long-term is really tremendous for us and also we have a tremendous lead in the emerging markets. ", "In terms of the ability to look at our portfolio in terms of what we should own or franchise, we constantly do that. We look at that every year and I can only tell you that we do have an earn the right to own mentality and we do have some markets that could potentially be refranchised and we are looking at that. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "And how much of a near-term priority is that for you, either improved company store margins -- I mean, what to me would suggest hundreds [inaudible] or sell them to franchisees. I mean, is that something that could happen in the next 12 months? I mean, how front-burner of an issue is it for you?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, why don\u2019t  I talk a little bit about margins, John, and I\u2019ll try to answer the first -- that question as well. To your point, we are not very happy with our margins at YRI this year and it was led by Korea, Mexico as we sort of said in our release and in our speeches. ", "I do want to emphasize that YRI has not gotten the benefit from commodities that we have seen in China and the U.S. so -- and that\u2019s due to long-term contracts. We signed long-term contracts really before commodities went down at YRI in quite a few places and those are starting to roll off now so we do expect some commodity deflation in the fourth quarter which will help margins then and hopefully into next year. ", "So right now in terms of YRI, I would also like to emphasize while we care a lot about the margins and we are focused on that, that\u2019s not the main driver of profitability at YRI. We are mostly a franchise dominated business and where we care most about our equity is when we are starting up in these markets that we think have huge potential for us. So for example, we have equity in France right now and while we have decent margins in France, they are not as high as you expect them to be given those high sales levels because we are still not at scale yet. But we expect to get there. India we are starting to have equity there as well and we think we have huge potential to grow those businesses. ", "So YRI primarily, we believe equity is more of a tool to get us started into high growth countries than a profit driver in itself. As we look at our portfolio, this is probably not the greatest time to make moves on it but it is something we will consistently look at, as David mentioned. ", "John Ivankoe - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you very much. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, John. Next question please, Ashley. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Just a clarification on the 2009 guidance -- it looks like a pretty pessimistic view on operating income for Q4. Is that all related to weakness in the U.S. or is there something else going on? And perhaps you can reconcile a little bit better your expectations for Q4 versus the year-to-date performance that you have seen?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think if you look at it versus year-to-date, and obviously we -- I will preface this again by saying it\u2019s a difficult environment to forecast but we probably expect similar type of results in China for the full year as we had seen year-to-date. On the YRI side, we said we probably expect to see slightly better profitability in the fourth quarter than we\u2019ve seen year-to-date, and the U.S. we expect to see probably significantly weaker profitability in the fourth quarter than what we have seen year-to-date, and that\u2019s driven by really the sales trend. If you look at the sales trends, we sort of said they haven\u2019t gotten better and in the third quarter, you saw that those were fairly weak across the board for us. ", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and if I can just ask a follow-up -- given the view related to Q4 based on the sales trends, what type of sales trends might you need to deliver that 10% income growth in 2010?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We haven\u2019t really put that all together yet. My guess it will be in about the 2% range but we have a lot of work to do before I can give you a better handle on that. One thing I would also like to mention regarding the fourth quarter is we benefited in the first three quarters by share repurchases, which added a couple of points to our EPS growth, and we expect that to actually work against us in the fourth quarter of 2009. Again, the other piece to make this challenging is we believe there will be some sort of correlation between sales growth and commodities. What we don\u2019t know yet is exactly what that will look like as we get into 2010 but my suspicion is that if we have higher sales growth, you will probably see firming up of commodities and if sales growth is weak, then we will probably continue to benefit from commodities. ", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Ashley, next question please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "One question and I guess one follow-up -- the question is on China. I was hoping you can maybe dive a little bit more into what you are seeing from a sales perspective. It seems as though consumer confidence there has stabilized and maybe ticked back up and the savings rate, which had been rising, is maybe stabilizing a bit. What are you guys seeing, how did it track throughout the quarter? And I guess maybe you can just reconcile that with your fourth quarter expectation which Rick, I think you just said you think would be pretty similar to what you have seen year-to-date from a profitability standpoint but that would be I guess better than the established guidance of about one point in restaurant margins, so am I thinking about that right? Are you thinking that the year will now be much better from a restaurant margin perspective than what you guys had originally outlined?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well again, a couple of things on China -- we are not going to update all of our segments for the full year by line item but regarding sales, we haven\u2019t seen any -- there weren\u2019t any major significant trends versus the quarter that provide insight. We really are going to repeat to what we said pretty much on the last call and that is that we saw the China consumer getting weak with the -- sort of the global financial crisis in around November, December last year. We haven\u2019t seen a lot since then, in either direction. We\u2019ve seen forecasts go up and down but we have sort of seen no real major change in the consumer and we think our results are more a reflection of what we were lapping, so we still see a fairly relatively weak consumer to what it was before November of last year. ", "Having said that, there are some signs that the China economy is getting better and as I sort of said in my comments, I believe it will get better before the rest of the world and we don\u2019t know exactly when the consumer will follow that trend and start to spend more but we think we are well-positioned for when they do. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "And my follow-up is in the U.S. and on the sales side of things -- I think David, either you or Rick put out a number that category sales, QSR sales for the category were down 2% and two of your brands were kind of in line with that. Maybe you could just talk about how that is different from category sales trends in the prior quarter and maybe -- you\u2019re in kind of a unique position to maybe talk about what\u2019s working in QSR today because your brands kind of serve various constituents and are positioned pretty differently. So can you just talk a little bit about -- we hear value all the time. What is working out there today and given that your brands haven\u2019t really seen any improvement to date despite your expectation that a Wing Street launch at Pizza Hut, I would expect you are going to expect that it\u2019s going to drive incremental same-store sales and you are going back in a bigger way to grilled chicken, which you guys have said is at KFC is a big driver. You know, why is it that you don\u2019t think that you are going to get a little bit of an up-tick as we move through the rest of this year?", "David C. Novak", "First of all, I think we have to deal with the macro situation that everybody is competing in right now. I don\u2019t think -- I\u2019ve never seen a softer U.S. consumer than what we are seeing today in my career. You\u2019ve got unemployment almost 10%, all-in it\u2019s about 17%. Surveys say 35% of consumers think they could lose their job in the next 12 months. Consumer confidence is weak. You know, people are saying that they are going to be cooking more at home. It\u2019s the first time where I\u2019ve actually seen    research show that people are actually cooking more at home than what they say they intend to do. ", "So I think this is a very, very challenging macro environment that everybody is dealing with. ", "Now what works, okay, first of all I think value is something that works in this category and I think what happens right now in the category though is everybody is doing value, so it\u2019s really hard to differentiate yourself. ", "The thing that has worked most this year in the category I think has been Kentucky Grilled Chicken and because it was most -- it was the most innovative new product that\u2019s been introduced in the category and during the introductory period, we saw a tremendous turnaround in KFC. ", "But I think in this category, if you historically look at what works, it\u2019s innovation, it\u2019s significant product innovation and it\u2019s also -- you have to have the strong value proposition and you have to operate your brands well, and I think that\u2019s been true in the past and I think it\u2019s even more true at -- during this period. ", "But the consumer is really under pressure, so even though you might be doing a good job in these areas, it may not be paying off for you like it has historically. So I think as we go forward, we are going to focus on making sure we are value competitive. Frankly we haven\u2019t been value competitive at Pizza Hut and I think that we are paying the price for it and we are also going to really push for much more innovation as we go ahead, and more significant innovation. ", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Steven. Ashley, next question please. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Just one on China -- if you could talk a bit about the new store productivity that you are seeing in that market. You know, we\u2019ve seen a bit of a delta between the system sales growth in Mainland China and the unit growth for a while now and I\u2019m just -- I wonder if that\u2019s related to going into some of the smaller cities or if you are just seeing a little bit slower opening volumes, given the environment out there and how that sort of colors your outlook for next year. Do you expect to open the same number of absolute units or keep the growth rate at the same pace? Thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Regarding first of all the difference between sales of new units versus existing units, in broad terms existing units are about $1.4 million of average unit sales. New units -- and this has been for a while, are more in around the $1.1 million range. That hasn\u2019t changed a heck of a lot. That\u2019s based on two things -- one is within existing cities, we obviously start with the best location so when you are adding the next wave of restaurants, they are going to have lower sales. And secondly, to your point as we go to smaller cities, we generally start at lower sales levels. I want to remind folks that at those lower sales levels, we also have lower cost structure and therefore our margins and returns are similar to the major cities. So we feel pretty good about our new unit economics and we expect that differential to continue going forward. ", "Regarding number of units, we haven\u2019t yet put or seen the detailed plans for 2010 but my best guess is you will see what has occurred over the last several years and that will be that the growth rate may marginally go down and the absolute number go up. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jason. Next question please, Ashley. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Jeff Omohundro with Wells Fargo.", "Jeff Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thank you. Just looking for a little more color on the KFC comp in Q3. From the standpoint of the grilled chicken rollout, just some details perhaps on the grilled chicken sustaining mix -- is it in line with your expectations and should we expect further line extensions around grilled chicken in the near future? Thanks. ", "David C. Novak", "You know, our mix on Kentucky Grilled Chicken continues to be very strong, well over 30%. And we\u2019ve got a full line of Kentucky Grilled items that we are developing in the pipeline. We believe the Kentucky Grilled Chicken was a major step forward in giving us the ability to do two things -- broaden the appeal of the brand and also increase frequency and one of the things that we are seeing with 60 million people trying the product and people are coming back into KFC again and I think that this brand really needed a major shot in the arm and that\u2019s what this product has provided for us. ", "What we have to do going forward is make sure we win in this segment, own the grilled chicken segment, which we definitely intend to do, with not only different forms but also different flavors. So the team is all over this and I am just glad that we have made the investment in the ovens and our franchise system seems to be committed to winning in this segment because it\u2019s critical to our success going forward.

", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Just actually one follow-up on a comment earlier and then a question -- the follow-up is just related to the G&A cost savings. I think you mentioned in your -- well, I know in your press release you kind of said you were close to $55 million year-to-date and the target is 60. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on 2010. I thought you mentioned something about you had discovered 20 already -- just wondering if that\u2019s primarily U.S. and whether you see similar such initiatives perhaps at either YRI or China to perhaps see more significant G&A savings in 2010. ", "And then separately just on YRI, I know you mentioned Mexico and South Korea weakness -- I\u2019m just wondering whether you can give a little bit more color perhaps in terms of percentage contribution, what the recent trends have been, and/or what your response is going to be to offset some of that weakness. Thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, let me handle the G&A piece first before we get into YRI -- year-to-date, our G&A has been over $50 million. We said it will be over 60 for the full year so the one thing that is different is we do have certain G&A expenses that are a bit back-loaded this year and that\u2019s why you are not seeing as big an increase in the fourth quarter as you saw in the third quarter. But it\u2019s basically -- reflects actions we\u2019ve already taken. ", "For 2010 on the U.S. side, we will continue to see some savings as we just continue the refranchising, you know, as you reduce restaurants that automatically reduces some of your G&A expenses. Beyond that, we\u2019ve also proactively looked at ways to manage costs in 2010, including for example reducing some of our meetings, et cetera. ", "So that\u2019s how we were able to get the combination of refranchising and project spending, those types of initiatives is how we are able to get a further reduction of at least $20 million, which would offset the refranchising piece of it.                 ", "Regarding YRI and China, what we would like to do is get a little -- YRI and China, we\u2019d like to get on the G&A side, we\u2019d like to get some leverage on G&A. If you look at China historically, our G&A has pretty much grown in line with our revenues or system sales and we are starting to get a little bit of progress there and would like to get more in 2010. Similarly in YRI, it\u2019s market by market. We have very high growth markets [which we] have to invest in and then we obviously have less developed markets. Again, our goal in 2010, given the environment, is to try to get some leverage on the G&A line. We don\u2019t want to get our costs out ahead of the business in this type of environment but we are going to continue to invest in growth initiatives, so we try to balance that effectively. ", "Regarding YRI, again on the margin side of it, Mexico and Korea, they are pretty small markets for us. If you look at it right now, we\u2019re not making a lot of money in those markets today so it\u2019s a small part of the total YRI profitability. So they don\u2019t have much impact on total profits -- as I said, that\u2019s more driven by our franchise growth businesses but they do have significant impacts on our margin pieces of it.

", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. A couple of questions as well -- could you comment on the visibility for food costs across the three businesses? Do you think you have several quarters now of favorable food costs?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think it\u2019s hard to say what the environment is going to be like going forward. Certainly in the fourth quarter, we will have some reductions -- not as high as we had in the third quarter because we saw some of the decreases starting in the fourth quarter last year. ", "Right now, our initial forecasts are we are seeing some modest decreases in the first quarter of next year in the U.S. That\u2019s about as far out as we have visibility right now. That will depend on probably cheese and beef are the swing factors on the commodity side for what will occur into the first part of 2010. ", "Beyond the first quarter, I think as I said before, it will depend on the environment. I think if demand stays weak then we will get more upside and if demand size has strengthened, you may see it come back up but we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility beyond the first quarter. ", "Right now, it costs you more than it typically does to lock in costs so the spot costs right now, if those were to continue would get us benefits throughout the first half of 2010 but obviously we can't adequately predict that. ", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Rick, is that true in China as well as the U.S.?", "Richard T. Carucci", "In China we do have visibility into the -- probably about that same timeframe and similar. We would expect -- actually in China we expect a similar commodity cost reduction in the fourth quarter as we saw in the third quarter and again, haven\u2019t seen detailed projections yet in 2010 but I would suspect we are going to see decreases at least in the first quarter. ", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then a question on China from a sales perspective, you know, you\u2019ve said for a couple of calls now that you saw the consumer pull back and then just basically stabilize. As we lap that initial pull-back, is it reasonable to expect to see better sales results year over year in China?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think that\u2019s a very plausible scenario. Again, as we said, this environment is very difficult to predict, Joe but we are well-positioned there and as I said, my personal belief is that the China market will bounce back before the rest but I don\u2019t know when that will be. ", "David C. Novak", "Joe, I think when you look at our average unit volumes in China, we were at $1.4 million. We got a McDonald\u2019s like franchise in China. There\u2019s no reason why we can't do over $2 million average unit volumes in China some day. And as the economy comes back, the way we are leveraging every day part, the upside we have with the multiple proteins, breakfast down the road, home delivery, you know, as this economy comes back we think that we will be able to grow same-store sales at a moderate level and do what we know is the number one driver of our long-term profitability is open up a lot of units. I mean, this year the reason why I am so happy about China, it\u2019s nice to have our unit growth go up 16% even with flat comps. I\u2019ll take that in a bad year and I think as we go into next year, we are going in with stronger capability than we\u2019ve ever had before and we continue to do a couple of other things that I think are pretty exciting. I think we are very excited about East Dawning and we are very excited about Pizza Hut home service. You know, these are down the road emerging categories that will come along with the Chinese customer.      ", "So I think we are -- this is sort of a year where we have been able to baton down the hatches pretty well, exceeding most people\u2019s profitability targets coming into the year. ", "Joe Buckley - Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a last question on the U.S. business -- the margins in the quarter, I understand the food cost but you got improvements on the labor line and the restaurant expense line, you know, with down comps, that\u2019s unusual. From your comments, you sound like you don\u2019t expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. Was there something unusual in the third quarter or do you think perhaps you understaffed a bit in the third quarter and you have to beef that up going forward?", "Richard T. Carucci", "The biggest impact is the impact on pricing. Again, remember what\u2019s happened in 2008, Joe, we had commodity inflation throughout the year and we were always chasing -- what I\u2019ll call chasing that commodity inflation so we kept taking price increases throughout the year. The last set of those price increases really occurred in the third quarter. So what\u2019s happening toward the end of the third quarter, so we were getting benefits in Q3 of 2009 where our pricing was higher than previous year levels at the same time we had the commodity  piece that we talked about. ", "So the biggest impact going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter is we are not -- we are getting a little bit less benefit from commodities but we are also not getting the benefit that we got from pricing. ", "On some of the other lines, there\u2019s not as much big change from quarter to quarter although there are some timing things that may make it a little rougher in the fourth quarter.

", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well again, I just want to make sure I clarify what we said, is we talked about overall third quarter results, we split it by concepts.

Carucci", "I honestly don\u2019t know the answer on the mix on the Why Pay More? When we looked at it traditionally, it hasn\u2019t changed a lot but I [don\u2019t have anything] recent on that and if commodity -- if demand stays soft and commodities stay where they are, I would expect no pricing in the near-term.

Can you talk about what you think is going to inflect between the fourth quarter and 2010 to drive the sequential up-tick in the business trends? Is it sales or is it margins despite the big commodity benefit or is it G&A cuts or how should we think about what the key drivers of that would be and where the inflection would be coming from? Thank you. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think that overall, again as you look at our model, it\u2019s very dependent on China and YRI and we continue to see the strong unit development there, et cetera. We haven\u2019t detail modeled out our 2010 -- enough detail to share with you but my suspicion is clearly that China and YRI are going to be big drivers of that growth as they have been in the past. ", "So a lot of our growth there, as we said before, is development oriented. A lot of that stuff is already in the ground. On the U.S. side, we sort of talked about the costs approach that we are taking, so we are trying to be prepared for a potentially tough consumer environment, at least in the first half of 2010. ", "The margin side of it is a piece that is just very hard to gauge at this point because you don\u2019t know the dynamics between the demand and the commodity piece of it, so in terms of the fourth quarter, what we are seeing is we benefited from very low cheese costs so far this year, especially in the sort of second quarter, third quarter. We see those ticking up a little bit in the fourth quarter -- again, hard to predict that going into the year but that\u2019s why -- one of the reasons why you are seeing less commodity benefits in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. ", "David C. Novak", "I think one of the things that Rick talked about in his comments is that we\u2019ve had in our history we\u2019ve always had challenges but this will be the eighth straight year that we will exceed our at least 10% target and I think it just comes back to the fact that we do have a portfolio and it\u2019s a global portfolio and we can compete in a real growth market, so I think we have a track record for getting to the goal line and we fully expect to be able to do it in 2010.

I mean, there is no question that we think we have the best brand in the category and we think we ought to be doing a lot better job. Our analysis of the situation is our single biggest problem is that we need to improve the value perception of our base pizza line. We are the premium pizza in the category at a time when obviously people are looking more for price than ever before and I think we are definitely paying a price for that.           ", "Our strategy to include both pasta and chicken into the mix, we couldn\u2019t be more convinced of. Right now pasta is about 10% of our mix and it\u2019s in 30% of our transactions, so we have a big business to move forward on. We\u2019re just in the midst now of advertising, building awareness of our line of wings. So we think what we have to do is do a lot better job of communicating, leveraging our quality, our variety, and the scale of the fact that we have 7,000 points of distribution out there. So we think we should be doing a lot better job.

Two questions -- first on the U.S. business, and in particular on Pizza Hut, and I guess maybe more broadly for the three U.S. brands, can you discuss your customer satisfaction scores? I know Champs was a big topic a few years back and supposedly the customer satisfaction scores may have slipped at Pizza Hut. I was wondering what your Champs scores show for the three brands and if there has been any slippage given that Pizza Hut is underperforming, Taco Bell, KFC are in line but I would think with such advertising, you should be outperforming there. If you can comment on the satisfaction side of the business, please. ", "David C. Novak", "Taco Bell, our consumer attribute measures are strong, are stronger than year-ago. Our ops measures are up pretty much across the board, Champs scores are up -- really proud of the great performance of the Taco Bell team and in addition to that, our margins have obviously improved, so I give the Taco Bell brand high marks. And as you know, Mitch, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a more charismatic brand in the United States than Taco Bell. Taco Bell users love the brand, it\u2019s talked about brand. You go to the cocktail parties and everybody tells you how much their kids love Taco Bell and our research basically confirms that as well. ", "Pizza Hut, our ops measures are slightly better than what they were last year. No big major improvements, so can\u2019t point to that being a big plus or a negative when you look at the performance. KFC is making significant strides cleaning up its system. We need to get much cleaner stores and we need to do a better job of speed of service. Our Champ scores are not statistically different than what they were a year ago. ", "So what we have done at KFC is we\u2019ve invested in the field. We\u2019ve put more resources up against our franchise system to make sure that we raise our standards and I think Roger Eaton and the team there are doing the best job we\u2019ve done in a long time to put more heat on not only our company stores but the entire system to step up on the operating front.

We don\u2019t think there is anything we can't do with them over the long-term and we think we\u2019ve got the power brands and the categories that we are in and we just have to do a better job taking advantage of the fact that I think our biggest asset is we have 35,000 under-utilized assets and that\u2019s why we are so aggressively pursuing new sales layers from breakfast to beverages and to proteins. You know, we really think that we have significant upside. Realize in the U.S. a lot of proof is in the pudding there but I really feel good about the fact that Pizza Hut does have pasta and chicken now going forward.

That\u2019s in the U.S. So when we look at our business, we are really focused on from a long-term perspective the international business that I\u2019ve talked about so much, China which obviously is big opportunity, and also Taco Bell. And when you look at KFC outside the United States, the only competitor we have is McDonald\u2019s, so why can't we do breakfast? I mean, look at all the concepts here in the U.S. I mean, who is closer to the egg than Kentucky Fried Chicken or KFC?

There\u2019s no reason in the world why we can't have breakfast, there\u2019s no reason in the world why we can't have a bigger beverage program and we are working on these kinds of things.

I guess I\u2019m just looking back on is it easy -- it\u2019s not an easy road to move over a brand reputation and to develop those lines when maybe there could be -- I used the word opportunity just because I figured that this is an opportunity where you could take on some brands that are primarily breakfast or primarily beverage rather than trying to change impressions, as it\u2019s tough to do with a very successfully well-developed brand of the KFC, Taco Bell, or Pizza Hut, as you\u2019ve experienced. I was just curious if there was something that you could add to it. ", "David C.

If something comes up, we\u2019ll obviously take a look at it. We always will reserve that right but -- and I agree with you, it is tougher to change the perceptions of KFC.

And the one on units is really this quarter we saw a dramatic pick-up in unit closures. In fact, the closures actually outpaced the openings by a decent amount. Can you give us some color on those franchisee closures and maybe how we should think about that going forward? I understand it might have been one large franchisee that contributed to that.

Thanks. ", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well to your point, the closures were actually driven by one market [in Spain] where we closed the Pizza Hut business there, so that was -- our contract came to an end and we agreed to go separate ways so that\u2019s really what drove the closures at YRI -- nothing systemic going on there. If anything, our net numbers have been improving over time except for that one event. ", "Regarding the sales at YRI, we sort of gave you the -- in the release the split by geographies. I would say nothing major to report there. In general, what we have seen recently is we have seen our transactions -- in the first part of the year, we had more ticket growth and again, people were taking pricing, et cetera, based on the inflation that they had seen in 2008. More recently, we have seen less impact from that so the numbers of flat are fairly close to what our transaction result is in the third quarter. We expect that probably to occur in the fourth quarter as well. We don\u2019t have visibility really beyond that point in time. ", "Keith Seigner - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please, Ashley. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time, sir. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Jerzyk. ", "David C. Novak", "Okay. Well, thank you very much for being on the call. Just let me wrap it up very briefly, our global portfolio of brands and business remain strong. We are very pleased with our third quarter results, including the 15% operating profit growth, excluding the special items despite the tough economy environment we\u2019ve talked about. China and Yum! Restaurants International continue to drive industry-leading new unit development and they constantly fuel our growth year to year and we are pleased we raised our full-year EPS growth forecast to 12% and we expect 2009 to be our eighth consecutive year of meeting or exceeding our annual target of 10% growth. ", "The fundamental opportunities for our global portfolio remain solidly in place. I think if we\u2019ve done one thing today, hopefully we\u2019ve convinced you how much we believe in what we already have on hand. We think that we will continue to grow our global business, increase the sales in our existing business, drive significant free cash flow like we have in the past, and continue to be the industry leader in return on invested capital. ", "So we love our business, tough year, but pretty good results. ", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Ashley. ", "Operator", "And this concludes today\u2019s Yum!

Please go ahead sir.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Kristen. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today on our call. The call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, also at www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.", "I would also like to advise this conference call includes forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s expectations based on currently available data. However, actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties.

Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak", "Okay, thanks Tim and good morning everybody. Given the tough macro environment, I'm especially pleased to announce that 2009 was another strong year of performance as we continue our quest to make Yum! Brands the defining global company that feeds the world.", "We reported 13% EPS growth marking the eighth straight year that we exceeded our annual target of at least 10% and achieved at least 13%. As I look back on the year, I'm really proud of what we accomplished in 2009. In a very tough year, we opened over 1400 new restaurants outside the United States, while making major progress on our incremental sales layers in each of our businesses.", "We improved our worldwide restaurant margins by 1.7 percentage points and operating profit grew by 9% prior to foreign currency translation. Importantly, we maintained our return on invested capital of 20% and continued to be an industry leader. In China, we grew about profits by a whopping 25% in 2009 on top of 28% in 2008. That is over 50% growth in two years.", "The good news is that we achieved these impressive results even though our same-store sales were slightly negative as the consumers have lagged the recent economic trends. We added a record 509 new units and now have nearly 3500 restaurants. KFC added 428 new locations, and made progress adding home delivery and building breakfast. Pizza Hut casual dining added 55 new locations, and is generating positive same-store sales results by adding a wide variety of appetizers, beverages, entrees and desserts.", "We also made progress with our two newest brands, Pizza Hut home service and East Dawning. Overall, 2009 was another great year of growth for our China business. Next Yum! Restaurants International continues to produce solid results with 5% system sales and profit growth, excluding foreign currency translation.", "Driven by our franchisee development machine, we opened nearly 900 new units in over 75 countries. Our strong network of around 1000 franchisees opened over 90% of these new units. Importantly, we made major progress creating new growth vehicles by investing in France, India and Russia, and beginning to develop Taco Bell into a truly global brand.", "Yum! Restaurants International made significant progress on sales players as well. KFC aggressively expanded our Crushers line of frozen beverages to over 1500 units in over 25 countries, up from around hundred units in seven countries at the beginning of the year. Pizza Hut is following China's successful strategy of offering more casual dining variety.", "In the United States, Taco Bell delivered solid margin and profit growth, which was offset by weak performance in KFC and Pizza Hut. We continue to invest in and expand our sales layers even though the benefit of these efforts was not yet visible in our same-store sales performance. Taco Bell has fortified its value positioning and has a full arsenal of news ready for 2010. I'm very optimistic; we will have another good year at Taco Bell.", "Pizza Hut has recently addressed its biggest problem, value, with the successfully tested $10, Any Way You Want It everyday promotion launched earlier this year. KFC made an important long-term investment by adding Kentucky Grilled Chicken, providing a balance option and eliminating the DeVito [ph]. All in all, the US business generated significant margin improvement in a challenged sales environment that led to weaker than expected 2009 profit growth of 1%.", "And importantly, each US brand goes into 2010 better prepared to beat year ago. For those of you who missed our annual investor update meeting, we showcased our three largest sources of profit, China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell US. These three businesses together generate 85% of our worldwide profits, and will be the key drivers of our future growth.", "I would like to thank all of those -- all of you who attended for the positive feedback from that meeting, but I would like to address two of the biggest questions we have been asked since then. First is Yum!\u2019s weak same-store sales performance in mainland China and early indicator that something is wrong with the business of that Yum! is growing too fast.", "We believe the answer to the question is definitely no. First, let us look at 2009 and put the facts into perspective. We added over 500 new restaurants, we held our transactions flat for the year, and we have near record restaurant level margins of 20%. Yes, same-store sales did decline 1%. Considering that, like I said earlier, we still grew our profits 25% on top of 28% growth in 2008.", "All in what most would call an off year for the Chinese consumer. Now as problems go, I will take it. For a little more perspective, let me step back to 2005, a year where we saw our same-store sales decline 3%. That year we opened 379 new restaurants and made $211 million. Now remember some people question our pace of development and the state of our business as a result of our negative same-store sales. Since 2005, we have added over 1800 restaurants and have tripled our profits to over $600 million.", "We now have 1.4 million average unit volumes at KFC with margins of over 20% and $1.2 million average unit volumes at Pizza Hut with margins of 19%. Our foundation for growth has never been stronger. Today, just like in 2005, China is and is predicted to be the fastest growing major economy in the world. In fact, it is expected to grow its middle-class from around 300 million today to 500 million to 2020.", "Like I said in the past, we will no doubt have some bumpy years. Unquestionably, we will have some ups and downs in China, but I wouldn't trade our position in China with any consumer company. That is enough history. Suffice to say we still believe China holds great potential, and we're clearly in the early innings of building our business in this massive and growing economy.", "Having said this, we constantly and I mean constantly monitor our returns and are committed to never building ahead of our people capability and unit economics. Our goal is to build a quality long-term business, and that is exactly what we're going to do.", "Next, while investors seem to understand our long-term growth strategy around our three largest businesses, China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell US; they are asking what are we doing to manage the short-term downside risk from our Pizza Hut and KFC US brands. This is more than a fair question because we made the conscious decision to not even cover Pizza Hut and KFC US at the December analyst meeting as they represent only 15% of our Yum! worldwide profit. Instead, we intentionally choose to highlight the 85% of our profits generated in China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell US.", "And particularly, we wanted to drive home the fact that Taco Bell is our big US growth engine, accounting for over 60% of our US profits and is a net grower of new units with lots of potential. That said, I want you to know that we are absolutely passionate about addressing the challenges of both Pizza Hut and KFC and turning around those businesses.", "At Pizza Hut, our long-term strategy is to transform the brand from pizza to pizza, pasta, and wings. However, our biggest short-term issue is the need to shore up and grow our pizza sales. Here, the consumer has told us frankly that we are simply too expensive. Basically they are saying, we love your pizza. We are America's favorite pizza, but I can\u2019t afford you.", "Well, going into 2010, the vast majority of our system has responded by making carryout pricing more competitive, and we have rolled out or successfully tested $10 Any Way You Want It promotion. We are pleased to say we have already seen a dramatic improvement in sales and traffic. More importantly, our system has seen the power of being value competitive, and we will continue to focus on everyday value throughout the year.", "We also have more successfully tested value initiatives in our pipeline along with premium pizza innovation that will command premium pricing. Simultaneously, we successfully tested and will be rolling out new ways to drive incremental occasions with pasta and wings. Pizza Hut is also focused on improving the speed of service and executing its heart of the hut [ph] program designed to improve hospitality. With these strategies and programs under way, we are confident that Pizza Hut will have a much better year in 2010.", "Now KFC, there is no question we have our work cut out for us. However, we have an absolutely great leadership team addressing issues our customers have been asking us to do for a long time. First, our customers have been telling us that we need to offer more balanced choices and our answer here is Kentucky Grilled Chicken. This product receives rave reviews and represents around one quarter of our chicken on the bone business. And the fact is, we hate to think of where we would be without it. In 2010, we will have more new product news and will be able to serve consumers Kentucky Grilled Chicken and our world famous original recipe chicken. We longer have the fried DeVito, because we now are the only brand to offer real chicken on the bone choice.", "Second, our KFC customers have told us we need to give them more value. So in 2009, for the first time in our history, we launched a nationwide value menu. We also brought the value message to over Kentucky Grilled Chicken launch with our $3.99 two piece meals. Offering everyday value will continue to play a critical role in moving this brand forward in 2010.", "Third, our customers have asked us to improve our operations, particularly about product availability and speed of service. So we have actively pursued raising our game by aggressively pushing for higher standards by investing in more franchise field support, increasing operational audits, and raking and stacking and publishing performance in our system, a tool used by all great operating companies.", "So in 2010, KFC is better prepared to offer the consumer more choice, better value and better service. But like I said we have more to do. Our goal is to stay focused on building the business back the right way, and we are confident you will see steady progress. But I want to be clear, we have not yet turned the corner, and we expect KFC sales will be tough in the first half.", "Now from a financial standpoint, remember we are in the midst of a multi-year program to reduce our company ownership to around 5% from 21% ownership at Pizza Hut and 18% at KFC at the end of 2007. This will give us an even more significant and more predictable stream of franchise revenue. And simply by reducing the G&A from company operations, we expect to generate at least as much profit with no capital expenditure by putting these restaurants in the hands of our good franchise operators.", "When you look at all our efforts, we are confident our US business is heading towards more reliable and a more predictable earnings and cash flow. So in 2010, here is what we expect our divisions to deliver. China will grow profits by 15%, Yum! Restaurants International will grow profits by 10%, the US business will grow profits by 5%. These are all reasonable targets and not a stretch from our perspective.", "Now remember, international new unit development of about 1400 new units from China and Yum! Restaurants International drive six percentage points of our EPS growth. We expect the balance of our growth to come from our base business through overall global same-store sales growth of 2%, productivity initiatives and G&A leverage, along with an expected benefit from foreign currency translation. When you add it up, we intend to extend our track record to 9 consecutive years of meeting or exceeding our target of at least 10% EPS growth.", "Now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Rick Carucci", "Thank you David and good morning everyone. In this section of our call, I'm going to comment on our key themes from our 2009 results, as well as our outlook for 2010.", "Yum! had another successful year in 2009. We grew earnings per share by 13% and for the first time achieved over $1 billion of net income. I would like to provide some context for our 2009 results around the following four themes, continued strong international new unit development, weaker than usual sales, strong productivity gains, and continued investment in growth initiatives.", "So, I will start with the first one, strong international development. We had a record year of development in China and another strong fear of YRI franchise led development. Our 2009 results again demonstrated that international new unit development is a significant and proven driver of Yum! profit growth.", "Second, weaker than usual sales. Our sales results were below our target as a globally weak consumer environment led to lower ticket averages. We had an especially weak second half of the year in 2009. There were some pockets of strength, our UK business, YRI developing markets such as India and Pizza Hut casual dining in China to name a few.", "Third, let us talk about productivity. Hats off to our teams in China and Taco Bell in the US, who drove substantial margin improvement in 2009. Both China and the US saw dramatic commodity inflation in 2008, followed by deflation in 2009. For the China division, the 1.8 point increase in restaurant margin during 2009 more than offset the margin decrease in 2008, despite net commodity inflation of $17 million over the past two years.", "In the US, total net commodity inflation over the past two years has been about $90 million. During this time, we improved our margins from 13.3% in 2007 to 13.9% in 2009. We also dramatically reduced over US G&A cost structure generating a $65 million benefit in 2009, which exceeded our $60 million target.", "Fourth, we continued investment and growth initiatives. During 2009, we continue to invest in future growth through emerging concerts, developing countries and incremental sales layers. One example was our investment in breakfast. We tested breakfast in KFC in the UK as well as in Taco Bell in the US. In China, we expanded the number of units to serve breakfast and increased our breakfast hours.", "In our New York meeting, we highlighted the dramatic growth of our KFC France and KFC India businesses. We ended the year with new unit growth of 33% in France and 60% in India. We are nearing the 100 unit mark in these two countries, the point of which we have been able to scale our businesses in other markets. We grew in other developing countries as well. Almost 60% of our YRI new units were in developing countries in 2009. When you combine these results with our continued expansion in China, we were able to expand our global lead in growing and developing economies.", "Next, I would like to give you an update on new franchising. We continue to manage our business with earn the right to own philosophy. When we don't see high growth or high returns we often refranchise units and hand them over to strong local operators. Refranchising brings greater stability to our earnings, reduces our capital and ultimately improves our returns.", "In 2009, we sold our KFC business in Taiwan to the Jardine Restaurant Group, one of our key franchise partners in Southeast Asia. In the US, we continue to make steady progress towards our goal of reducing US company ownership to 10%. In 2009, we sold 541 units, exceeding our goal of 500, despite the challenges of a tight credit market. We made substantial progress at Pizza Hut, where we sold 427 units and reduced company ownership to 11%.", "In 2010, we expect to refranchise approximately 500 units in the US, mainly Pizza Huts and KFCs. In summary, we are proud of our teams for delivering in this environment. We have a demonstrated robust business model that delivered 13% EPS growth, despite $45 million of foreign currency headwind. We raised our dividend by 11%. We improved our competitive position by investing in our future with new units, stronger brands and new sales layers.", "Now let us look ahead. In 2010, we do not expect a strong economic turnaround and have built our plans accordingly. We are confident that we will deliver our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Here is why. First, let us remember that international new unit development will remain a key driver of our growth. We expect to once again add 1400 new units outside the US in 2010 and as David mentioned, we expect international new units built in 2009 and 2010 to deliver about six points of EPS growth in 2010.", "Second, although it is especially difficult to predict sales right now, we do believe we are better prepared for a tough consumer environment than we were last year. First of all, we have another year of sales layer experience under our belt. For example, at YRI we now have the Crushers beverage line in over 1500 stores in 25 countries. In China, KFC now offers delivery in 95 cities, and has added protein variety with shrimp and beef as permanent menu items.", "At Taco Bell in the US, we fortified our value position and continual product news around our Why Pay More value platform. We also have a strong pipeline of new products such as soft corn shell Cantina Tacos. Across all our Yum! businesses we are focused on providing a stronger balance of innovation and value. Overall, we expect our first quarter sales to be below our normal growth rates, and expect stronger growth in the back half of 2010. And yes, part of the reason for that is we lapped weaker results from the last half of 2009.", "Finally, we expect to see a tailwind from foreign currency translations at least through the first half of 2010. For Yum! our strength is coming from our three largest businesses, China, YRI and Taco Bell in the US. We believe that these businesses represent a powerful growth combination. In China, we have higher return and rapid new unit development with excellent economics. At YRI, we have a mostly franchised business model with a strong track record for success that is poised to drive further growth around the globe.", "At Taco Bell in the US, we have a contemporary brand that is well positioned for sales layer growth. As David mentioned, we will continue down this steady path of refranchising at KFC and Pizza Hut. Once we complete our refranchising, we are confident that these brands combined will deliver at least as much profit as they did in 2009. Together, they will continue to deliver strong and steady cash flow for our shareholders.", "In summary, I am very proud of our financial results in 2009. I'm excited about our future as we fully expect to continue to generate consistent financial performance, global growth, strong free cash flow, and a substantial return to shareholders in 2010 and beyond. David?", "David Novak", "Okay, thanks Rick. I hope you can tell that we are very excited about putting 2009 to bed with 13% earnings per share growth, eighth straight year where we have exceeded our target of at least 10%, and we are really delighted to be on with 2010 and looking forward to the year. So, with that what I like to do now is open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question is from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Thanks very much. My question David, the Pizza Hut US business we know is just becoming a very small part of the overall profit stream, and you did give us some insight as to why you think it is weak. But I just like to ask you a different angle on it, do you think that the product proliferation has had any damaging impact, and just as I think about the rest of the world, where you are pushing a lot of different types of products, perhaps considered non-core products through the KFC stores and Pizza Hut, can you assess the risks perhaps of the product proliferation strategy outside the US. Thank you.", "David Novak", "Just for clarity Mitch, when you say product proliferation, do you mean adding like pasta and chicken?", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Yes, pasta and chicken in the US and then as we look outside the US, you know KFC does a lot more than chicken. And there is breakfast and beef, and at Pizza Hut in many markets just going way beyond kind of the core casual dining that we have seen in the US Pizza Hut business. Just the product proliferation in general, which seems to be having a damaging impact in the US, and if you can assess maybe if there is any risk of that big picture outside the US?", "David Novak", "Okay. First of all, I really think that the addition of the pasta and the wings has actually strengthened our US business. You know two years ago, we launched pasta, and we had very strong sales with the pasta launch. As we went into 2009, we all know we faced a much tougher economic environment, and what pasta really served for us in 2008 was almost like the launch of a major new pizza. And what we had difficulty doing in 2009 was overlapping the success of pasta, primarily because what the research tells us is that we just weren\u2019t being value competitive.", "So our pizza sales declined and that typically happens in the Friday, Saturday, Sunday period of the week. And it was so clear, wide and clear the reason why it declined is not because we were focused on pasta, because we had a mix of both pasta and pizza advertising. It was because we were uncompetitive. Consumers told us very clearly that we\u2019ve got the pizza they want to eat, but we were too premium priced and that we had to get more value competitive to win.", "So I think that as we go into 2010 the fact that we have learnt as a system, and I think our entire system has learnt this, franchise, company together, we have learnt it. If you try to provide great competitive value, we can win, and what we are focused on doing is making sure that we provide that great competitive value on a pizza basis. And what we want to do is win the weak indication with pizza. However, we also have an effect that is basically not being utilized during the week, and that is where we think we have the opportunity to drive incremental occasions with wings and pasta with Pizza Hut.", "So we think our strategy is right on the money. Last year we did testing on how to deliver better value. We also did testing on both pasta and wings on how to make it more incremental for us and use our assets throughout the week, and you will see that as we go into 2010. You know, what we are really trying to do at Pizza Hut is change the game. Our business has basically been relatively flat from a sales perspective over the last decade.", "You know, our unit economics has been strong, but we really haven't grown the business, and what we think we can do by being more value competitive on pizza, we can be more competitive, drive more pizza sales, and we can let them also leveraged that asset throughout the week with pasta and wings. So we really think we have made substantial progress at Pizza Hut, and what we have now, I think is a much better balance and understanding of how to drive pizza, which is more on the value front, and you also see pizza innovation from us, which is what we're famous for, and which we think we can get more premium pricing on. And then we can in addition to driving pizza we can leverage our new items the pasta and wings to get incremental occasion during the week.", "The big thing in food services is can you stretch your brand and can you have credibility to go into new segments. Without question, Pizza Hut can clearly go into pasta, and wings is a basic add-on in almost every pizza chain in the United States, because it just goes with pizza. So there are things that people see totally synched up to the pizza occasion. And we think that what we're trying to do with our businesses, we think our biggest asset is that we have got 35,000 assets that are underutilized, okay. And it is because we primarily just have been focusing on one thing and one day part.", "And our biggest opportunity is to take these brands and leverage our assets throughout the week and give consumers more meaningful variety. And there is no doubt in our mind that we are on the right track. You know, Pizza Hut in China for example added significant with 30% more menu items to really compete in casual dining, and we saw a significant turnaround not only in terms of our same-store sales, but also in terms of our margins improved as well.", "So, we got it -- if you are going to be casual dining, which by the way Pizza Hut is the number one casual dining chain in the world, and particularly outside the United States it is the number one casual dining chain, you are going to compete on casual dining, you have to provide variety. And our customers, they want to have pizza, they want to have pasta, they want to have chicken, they want to have salads. If you come in to sit down, they want to be able to have some coffee and beverages, and they want to have desserts, and we have got that asset sitting there, with back at the house it certainly has a room to provide them, and we want to be the number one casual dining chain.", "And you are not going to be that by just selling pizza. So Mitch, we could not be more convinced that we are hunting in the right territory, and we're moving in the right direction on Pizza Hut and one of our big advantages with KFC is that we can't stretch the brand. In the United States, we are primarily known as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Outside the United States, we're known as KFC.", "Just like McDonald's, McDonald's might have started out as McDonald's hamburgers, but outside the United States and inside the United States they are McDonald's today. And they have been able to stretch that brand into eight different product categories, leveraging their assets throughout the day. That is our strategy. We think we can stretch KFC. It is easier to do it outside the United States, because we don't stand so much for Kentucky Fried Chicken. In fact, our KFC business was built more with portable sandwiches, a much bigger business with much less focus on chicken on the bone.", "And there is nothing that is closer to the egg than KFC, okay. So if anybody ought to be able to do a breakfast, it ought to be KFC. And that is basically an opportunity that we think we can tap into, and by the way our most successful business in the world is KFC in China. And KFC in China has taken the approach that we can do chicken, we can do beef, we can do fish, we can do breakfast, we can do beverages. That is the same approach that McDonald's has taken.", "And I think the fact that we have been preemptive and proactive in doing that in China has been a big competitive advantage for us. It is why we got $1.4 million average unit volumes in China. It is why we are sitting here saying we are like McDonald's is in the United States in China. It is why we think we can have so many restaurants in China one day, because right here, because McDonald's has leveraged this asset, they have got 14,000 restaurants in the United States. That's only with 300 million people.", "So 2020, it is going to be 500 million in the middle-class in China. We're going to have an asset that is going to be leveraged. We are going to have higher sales. McDonald's has over $2 million average unit volumes in the United States. You know, we have got plenty of runway for same-store sales with KFC. We are only at 1.4 million. Breakfast is only 5% of our mix right now.", "I mean, so -- but the big thing that we are doing is we are leveraging the power of our brands, we are leveraging the power that we have these assets, and we're putting these building blocks in place. And yes, it is hard to see that right now in terms of the same-store sales growth that we are getting, but let us face it. This economy has not exactly been booming, but our strategy for the long term is so right on. It is unbelievable.", "So we are very excited about where we're at. I'm sorry I'm going on on this, but you know, this is why I'm talking to our people about every single day. I mean this is like we got opportunity, we got to go out. I would be worried if we have all these categories, and we have already done all these things, and we already have breakfast, and we already had late night. You know, we're not even open in some markets late. Okay.", "So we got a big opportunity, and we're all over it, and we are going to -- we can perform even in tough economies, like we just had last year and deliver, but the main thing is we are working on a long-term strategy here to leverage these assets, leverage our brands, use our assets throughout the day, get those sales up, improve our unit economics and just keep growing.", "Rick Carucci", "Thanks Mitch. Next question.", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Thank you very much.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you about Rick, your comment on the weak first-quarter same store sales, do you expect negative same stores in all regions or is that a blended comment. Maybe you can provide a little color on what you were expecting by region and then can you talk a little bit about China specifically. McDonald's talked about their results being positive in December for the first time in many months. You know, their comparisons are different, their situation is different, but can you talk about if you have seen any encouraging signs in that market recently?", "Rick Carucci", "Thanks John. First, I would say that there are some challenges in reading the real trends right now because of whether, not just in the US but offshore as well. Also regarding China and YRI Asia, we're probably not going to get a great read on that John until March, once the Chinese New Year impact clears. Remember the Chinese New Year was in January in 2009, but it is in mid-February this year.", "Our general approach is that we don't provide comments in the middle of a quarter on sales trends, unless there is a very significant change in results. The recent focus on value at Pizza Hut in the US at $10 pizza offer has had a dramatic, positive impact to transaction and sales trends thus far in 2010. Overall in the US based on that Pizza Hut performance as well as our overall confidence on the Taco Bell initiatives, with respect to our first-quarter same-store sales to be below our normal levels, but significantly better than what you saw in the fourth quarter of 2009. That is pretty much what we're going to comment about trends at this point John.", "Tim Jerzyk", "John, this is Tim Jerzyk, one other thing that you should be aware of. Rick talked about the Chinese New Year. It will affect YRI in that the timing of it -- while it won't impact China's results, it is same quarter this year, quarter one as it was last year, but YRI because of our reporting differences, it will negatively impact quarter one, but benefit quarter two. That will affect your thoughts as well.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Did trends in December get better than the quarter overall in China.", "David Novak", "Again, we only comment when we see dramatic changes within a quarter. What we have said at the analyst meeting is generally still our position until we say otherwise, and that is that we saw the China consumer really slow down towards the end of 2008 at that point, and since then we haven\u2019t really seen much of a change yet.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks John. Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Keith Seigner with Credit Suisse.", "Keith Seigner - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. I'm going to ask a little bit more specific question, the domestic franchise and license expenses has been climbing pretty meaningfully over the last two years and very significantly in this most recent quarter. And there is not a whole lot in that line-item, I mean so what I was wondering is if you could talk a little bit more about what might be the cause of the increase there. Is it franchise market funding, is it uncollectible royalties, is it increases in things like audits for the KFC system. If you could help us gain some understanding about what is going on in that line-item that will be great.", "David Novak", "Well, regarding the increase in this quarter that was driven by increases in our bad debt reserve for KFC, primarily in Long John Silver in the US. And the way we account for that Keith in our current policy, we think we're pretty prudent. We reserve the entire receivable if a franchisee is more than 60 days behind schedule.", "Now for KFC, 80% of our franchisees are on time, but we have seen the percentage of people under pressure go up during 2009. We are prepared for even a modest increase in that level in 2010, and also for -- potentially some more closures in 2010. Having said that, I'm quite confident that anything along those lines would not have anything any material impact on Yum!\u2019s overall performance in the year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steven Kron with Goldman Sachs.", "Steven Kron - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks. Hi guys. Maybe one follow-up question in China, can you just maybe talk a little bit about some regional commentary like you typically provide, are the export driven regions as bad relative to the other part of the country, and maybe you can put quite a bit of color around that. And then secondly, within the US, looking at Taco Bell down 5% same-store sales in the quarter, seemingly underperforming the category as a whole, you know Taco Bell is known for its value, I was just wondering if you could maybe comment as to what you saw out of that brand throughout the quarter, and maybe talk a little bit about the early read on the Drive-Thru Diet at this point and how that has gone, and then lastly with cash building a little bit on the balance sheet, didn't repurchase any stock again this quarter, can you talk a little bit about use of cash going forward?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yeah, let me answer. This is Tim Jerzyk. Let me answer the last question first. On the cash, there was a little bit of buildup at the end of the year. Some of that was just offshore cash in terms of timing and bringing it back, and we do anticipate fully anticipate utilizing the 300 million share repurchase authorization we got from the board during 2010.", "David Novak", "Okay, all right. Regarding China I will just give a little perspective. When you look at China for the year, we had basically flat transactions with all the economic challenges that we had. The same-store sales were up 3% in the low export markets, while high export markets were basically down about 5%. So what we're doing basically is we're focusing on developing in low export markets in the central and the western parts of the country.", "You know, I think that there is some increased competition in Chinese QSR and catering service particularly in the tier one cities. However, remember Yum! is in 650 cities, and we really in the vast majority of those systems cities, we are the only restaurant there or quick service restaurant there. So, we don't know exactly when the Chinese consumer will come all the way back, but when they do come back, we're better positioned for any kind of rebound than any other competitor due to our footprint in China. So that is basically all I can give you on that. As it relates to Taco Bell, you know we are very pumped up about what is going on in Taco Bell, you know, our value image has definitely been strengthened.", "In January, we had $0.89 value message out there in tandem with our fresco advertising. The consumer today recognizes that no one gives you more value. And that perception is stronger today than it has ever been, which bodes well in this climate. What we did with fresco is we took the offense on nutrition, because we think it is important for the long term to make sure that we communicate the fact that we have got balanced options out there for our customer. We did that through the launch of the Drive-Thru Diet, which was featured and talked about on the TODAY show just a couple of days ago, where we got a good mention on that.", "Our fresco transactions will be in our (inaudible), and we think that it will be a sizeable move for us over time. I think when you look at Taco Bell, the reason why we're confident is that we do have this value image. Right now we are continuing our $0.89 products, which give you a ton of food for $0.89. It is delicious, okay. And we have got the best pipeline coming up that we\u2019ve had in a long time. And longer term, our breakfast program continues to be promising. We plan to expand it to more test markets this year. We are hopeful for a national launch of breakfast in 2011. And we\u2019ve extremely good margins.", "Our margins are very healthy, which allows us to grow new units. At net new unit development last year, we think we have the potential to go from over 5200 units to Burger King levels of 7500 units over time, and as we you know, add breakfast, continue to develop new beverages, you know, we think that that's going to strengthen our unit economics over time as well to facilitate that. And our goal is to you know, we're already the second most profitable brand in the US and our goal to leverage our assets like McDonald's has done ultimately 24 hours a day.", "You know, I think in last year you know, we -- and the fourth quarter was no exception. You know, there is -- you had a very tight tough economy, you had everybody offering all kinds of value. We are very pleased that when you look at the consumer research today, we improved our value proposition in that environment and we know that our brand is charismatic. We know we've got tremendous upside and stretch. So we are very optimistic that we can have a good year, another very good year at Taco Bell.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Steven. Next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Great. Thank you very much. Just two questions, one as it relates to the G&A savings opportunity. You mentioned you hit the $65 million in '09. Just wondering whether you have kind of a set target, whether it be US, China, or international, I should say YRI in terms of incremental savings that you think you can leverage in 2010. And then separately you mentioned kind of in the release of the Long John Silver name and A&W, I guess multi-branding is not really the strategy we are going to pursue going forward. Wondering whether there is a potential to sell those brands or whether we'll see those brands continue to operate here as it relates to generating incremental cash for the business. And just as an aside to that might some of the excess cash that we're talking about see further debt paid down in 2010 or is it priority share repurchase at this point. Thanks.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, let me -- I'll answer that last part first Jeff on excess cash. We're very focused on -- this year we'll be focused on share buyback. We did some things last year to reduce. You will see our balance sheet long-term debt was reduced by about $300 million. We really have no debt payable that we can, you know, basically can access with surplus cash this year. Our next maturity is April of 2011, and we are focused on successfully getting past maturity and refinancing probably part of that. So we'll -- like I said earlier, we're going to, we expect to fully utilize the $300 million share purchase authorization that we have from the board, and that's how we'll be using the cash.", "David Novak", "Regarding Long John Silver A&W, you know, our multi-branding strategy is tactical, because what we are focused on is our sales layer strategy that I've talked about. Our goal with Long John Silver and A&W is to make those brands stronger and to build them working with our franchisees.", "Rick Carucci", "Regarding the question on the G&A Jeffrey, this is Rick. In 2009, we took the big bite on G&A and that was beyond just sort of this store level stuff and payroll perks, et cetera that would be associated with refranchising. In 2010, we expect some G&A savings, but more of the direct stuff that's related to refranchising. So area coaches, payroll people that type of approach. What we said is we believe that amount will be around $20 million and will offset any profit trade down from the rest of the refranchising program. So we think that net the refranchising will be roughly mutual to profits in 2010 because of a G&A reduction in the area of about $20 million.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Internationally?", "Rick Carucci", "Internationally, what we just sort of said for 2010, and we're still -- that plan is that, again we're still growing a lot of business around the world, but we hope to get is some G&A leverage. So the G&A grows at a lower rate than our revenues in 2010. So we're taking a little bit more prudent approach, but we are continuing to invest in growth markets like India and China.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please, Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Hi guys. My question is on investment. You obviously let returns dictate your investment from year to year, and you've obviously been refranchising and investing heavily in China, but I wonder if there is something that you can do to be even more aggressive in repositioning your investment. For instance, could you do something more dramatic about lightening up your company\u2019s store investments in the US and YRI equity markets. Does that make sense to perhaps think more aggressively take one time charges perhaps even to truly remove the earnings risk from KFC US and equity exposure in the YRI division, where the margins are frustratingly not getting better quickly. And then conversely, maybe it makes sense to even step up investment in China through what could prove to be a trough period as, you know, the old Yum! did in the past with China. Thanks.", "David Novak", "Well David, we try to look at you know, each market locally. We look it obviously on a broad basis, but, you know, if you go at the last piece of it, we tell China go as fast as you can, as prudently as you can. So David that they never want to get ahead of our unit economics, our people capability, and then I think the team has done a really good job of that. You know, the way we could look at capital, and you probably know that but for some of the others is that, we don't have a fixed number in the year, right. So when we have a plan for China, if China can build more units, we don't turn them off. We could keep going.", "Similarly, if somebody else is not getting the returns that they need to get on new units, we will shut them off if they don't get the sort of spend their plan. So we try to be very disciplined on those decisions. Similarly, on the refranchising and in, you know, you saw an example of that where we you know, sold the Taiwan business this year. We'll always look at those opportunities and we'll continue to do that on a go forward basis. We've put a lot of attention about making sure we're investing in places that could get high growth and high returns and, you know, similarly you know, paring things back when we don't, and, you know, I think the US refranchising, I've been pretty pleased with the pace. I know that some people question, you know, can you get it done. I sort of -- I hope they keep questioning whether we could get  it done and up until the day it's done, and I think we're doing that at a good pace.", "We're selecting the right franchisees and the right operators. That's very important to us, because obviously we got to be running these brands for a long time, and we need the right operators there. At the same time, we're getting the deals done. So I think we're getting that balance pretty well and we're going to continue down that path.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Thanks guys.", "David Novak", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks David. Kristen, next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup", "Great. Yes. Just with respect to China, just wondering how maybe price sensitive you've noticed the Chinese customer versus the US consumer and would you consider offering more promotions to drive traffic, and also on the competition front there, what are you seeing from global restaurant chains within China. Are they sort of becoming more promotional or you know, what types of changes have you been seeing lately?", "David Novak", "Well, I think you know, first of all we are already value competitive in China. We offer good value. Our consumer ratings say that we offer good value. So we don't see any acceleration of our value proposition in China. In terms of what are we seeing from global China competition, there isn't a lot of global China competition. The only real global competitor we have there is McDonald's of any significance. We are seeing some increase in just local chain development, Chinese in particular, in major cities like Shanghai and Beijing, but that's basically what we're seeing on the competitive front. What was the other question part of that?", "Was that, where those the two?", "Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup", "Yes, that pretty much hit it. That was great. Thanks.", "David Novak", "Thanks, okay.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mark Kalinowski with Janney Capital.", "Mark Kalinowski - Janney Capital", "Hi, I'm hearing from some of my industry contacts that relations between Yum! and KFC's domestic franchisees are getting a little bit tensed. Maybe you could comment on that situation and what might be driving that. Thank you.", "David Novak", "Okay. I agree, well.", "Rick Carucci", "Hi, listen. You know, we have a phenomenal group of franchisees that are very committed to growing the business and we have great leader, Roger Eaton, who is working with the franchisees to get us through a really, really tough time right now and I think one of the things that we've been doing at KFC is we've been addressing three issues that the KFC system has really avoided too long. You know, attacking the fried DeVito by offering customers the choice of Kentucky Grilled Chicken, attacking our value problem, which is driven primarily by too high a local pricing, which our franchisees control, but we do have a national value menu for the first time in our history.", "We also had very good pricing on Kentucky Grilled Chicken last year with our two piece meal at $3.99. And then the third thing that we've been working on that's been you know, something that we've needed to put more focus on, and Roger Eaton and the team in addition to launching Kentucky Grilled, in addition to attacking value have been providing -- is to provide more reliable service. So we've increased our investment in operations by having more franchise coverage. We've increased our store level operational audits, Mark.", "We really started racking and stacking performance of our operators. And, you know, once we get good performance, we raise the standard. You know, so we're constantly you know, raising the bar on our performance. These are very tough issues. You know, not everybody, many of our more progressive franchisees have, but not everybody wanted to launch a grilled product, okay. Not everybody wanted to do a value menu, but we did one. Not everyone wanted to do $3.99 for the two piece meal, but we did it. These were tough things, and certainly not everybody enjoys seeing their operating performance racked and stacked and published, and not everybody enjoys that store audit, where you go in and you know that you can improve things.", "Now, our best franchisees, they are cheering us on, okay. They are saying go get them, you know, go get it, let's build the system together. They are cheering us on, but these are tough issues that Roger Eaton and the team are working with our best franchisees to address. They're not popular, okay, with some of our franchisees but I think the bulk of our franchisees know that it is important and it's necessary, but this -- running the KFC system is not for the fainthearted.", "The marketing control is owned by the franchisees. It takes tough-minded leadership to make meaningful progress and our leadership, which by the way is some of the best leaders we have anywhere in the world, and people I admire, as much as I admire anybody in our company, they know that winning in business is not about winning a popularity contest. What we are trying to do is win the hearts and minds of our customers, and I'm confident that we have the know-how, and more importantly the perseverance to get this done.", "We want to be so proud of KFC in the United States. We want to be so proud. We want KFC in the United States to be like it is in Australia, in the UK, and we've even had significant progress in Japan, which is a very, very immature and tough market. We want to have our chest, you know, pumping at KFC, and I think the things that we're working on Mark are, they are very tough issues to work through with any franchise system, but it's the way how you turn a business around for the good, and I couldn't be more proud of the KFC team and the franchisees that are supporting us in this effort.", "Mark Kalinowski - Janney Capital", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Mark. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Thomas Forte with Telsey Advisory Group.", "Thomas Forte - Telsey Advisory Group", "Great. Thank you very much. Two quick questions, one, can you tell us the state of the financing market for the other parties engaging in these refranchising transactions, their ability to get funding, and then second if you could give us some thoughts on 2010 margin, particularly what you're expecting in commodities for the US and China, and maybe on a first half and second half basis for 2010. Thank you.", "David Novak", "Well, on the financing for refranchising, I think it's noticeable that each of the last two years, we've exceeded our targets, and I think as someone mentioned earlier, right up until the last minute people have been questioning whether we are going to make it or not. So deals are being done. I think the important thing from what we've seen is that there is financing available for franchisees in our brands, in particular that have good track records. They have been in the business for a period of time, they have good relationships with their lenders, good relationships with their banks, and they have good balance sheets and that's where the deals are getting done.", "We're also bringing in new franchisees where they obviously -- to us they've gone through the process and we believe that they are going to be really great operators and they also have the financing capabilities. So, while it is a tough environment and it makes it more challenging, the team is you know very much on top of this, and as you can see each year, they are getting it done even in very tough environment. So there is still financing out there, but it is tougher.", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, regarding commodities, pretty hard to predict in this environment. What we sort of said in December is pretty much flat for the year. Where we have visibility to is probably the first half of the year, especially the first quarter. We do expect commodities to be down in the first quarter year-over-year, and then our assumption is they will go up a bit in the back half. Hard to predict how margins will play out because obviously you have the interplay between the sales and commodity side. So obviously we are very focused on that as we were in 2009 and will, you know, report those numbers as we see them.", "Thomas Forte - Telsey Advisory Group", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Rachel Rothman with Wedbush.", "Mike - Wedbush", "Great, thanks. It is actually Mike [ph] signing in for Rachel. Can you just talk about the impact of axing out Thailand, and Taiwan on the (inaudible), specifically as what it does to the '09 margins, and how much up op income in revenue dollars come out of the China numbers. And then on YRI, which came out slightly lower than guidance that you gave in early December, yes given that there were roughly 3 weeks less at time and China and US are roughly in line. Could you talk about what happened there in mid to late December that led to the surprise, and I guess whether does continue in January. Thanks.", "Tim Jerzyk", "This is Tim Jerzyk. Let me answer that first part. On the China division, the alignment piece where you have KFC, Taiwan and Thailand moving to YRI during the first quarter. We'll provide you restated numbers as we go, and we can give you some ideas. It's not that significant in terms of the revenues and profit margins. I would -- suffice to say margins will be a little bit higher when you take those two businesses out, but we'll give you the restatements as the year goes on.", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, regarding YRI, I think what we saw in 2009 was we had very strong sales in the first part of the year, and then gradually weakening with the global economy. And so I don't look at it as a huge change in trends that occurred in the last month that this just been a general softening. Again hard to predict what's going to happen in 2010 when you know, the global economy is going to strengthen, but, you know, don't see any huge changes in trends at this point.", "David Novak", "Biggest thing -- the biggest change in trend over the year, actually if you look at it for YRI in particular was check average decline during the year, and Rick mentioned this earlier in his comments that it was -- a lot of it was pricing rolling off and that was certainly reflected in the YRI sales earlier in the year. There was still pricing. By the end of the year that was pretty much gone, and then also trade down by the consumer. So with a fair amount of check average impact to that, to YRI's growth as the year went on.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, thank you. I just had a question to go back to the US business, you mentioned that your margins obviously are up versus where they were a couple of years ago, despite the fact that we've had some you know, on average negative comps over the past two years, and then I know there was some commodity inflation, but in fact it does look like your food and paper as a percentage has come down. So I guess I'm trying to get at is for your company operating margins, can you bucket out what piece of this is maybe just operational improvements versus mix, you know, more Taco Bells if that's higher margin versus what kind of benefits you get from refranchising. So to the extent that you refranchise some of the lower margin restaurants, has that been helping too?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, I can tell you -- Sara, this is Tim. The refranchising piece on margins for the year was 40 basis points, four tenths of a point. The rest of it was the impact of commodities, net of pricing and then productivity initiatives.", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, and that's the challenge. Obviously, the pricing and the commodities pieces occurred at different points in time. So what happened in 2008 is we had rapid commodity inflation in the US. So, I think the number was $119 million for the full year and it kept going up as the year progressed. So we were sort of chasing our call pricing in the US in 2008, and then we were getting rollover benefits in 2009. But we were pretty much done with most of our pricing actions by the fourth quarter of 2008. So we got very little benefit. We got benefits from pricing up until through the third quarter of 2009, then very little benefit in the fourth quarter. Regarding mix, we are getting some favorable mix on margins, first of all globally as China becomes a bigger part of the mix, and then in the US as Taco Bell is becoming a bigger part of the mix as Tim talked about.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "Thanks.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Sara. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan", "Great. Hi, thanks. You've already touched on the YRI part of this question, but I was hoping that you know, with your ability to really look into the China market, you know, to really explain the deceleration that we saw in 2009, and obviously ending the year on a low note at down 3. You mean, the thought was you know, we would be lapping the economic slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2008, and especially you know, the meaningful slowdown that you saw until December. So if you could just make some you know, more specific comments in terms of maybe on a macro basis, you know, what you think drove you know, a slowdown you know, in sales throughout the year, and I know in the past you've talked about things like consumer confidence and savings rate and what have you, but what do you think the best economic indicators are for us to look at to try to really say, okay well, you know, this is improving then Yum!\u2019s business should be improving as well.", "Rick Carucci", "I'll go first and Tim could add to it John. I think it's not just one measure. You know, when we look at it and we're not economists, but when we look at measures, we tend to look at a portfolio. So we're looking at consumer confidence. We look at the export markets and we look at sort of the GNP [ph] as some guidelines, and in terms of 2009 I will just repeat, even though, you know, same-store sales you know, bounced around a little bit, we just sort of felt the consumer was pretty level the whole time. It was bad and they never you know, you had months whether it looks bad or worse, et cetera, but I would just sort of categorize at least from our perspective, John, as the consumer was pretty much you know, down a bit all year in 2009. I don't think we are going to get a good read as we sort of said earlier until after the Chinese New Year, and that's because Chinese New Year overall is always a very event driven and is a little bit like Christmas in the US.", "You have some time where people will spend in holidays and then not spend a non-holiday period. So when we get into our second quarter, which is sort of starting in March in China that's when we\u2019ll really bad on bad economic numbers. Again the economy in China started weakening really around the December time frame, but if you look at some of the measures around consumer confidence et cetera, they really, you know, bottomed out really in the first quarter of 2009. So it will be interesting for us to see what happens when we sort of lap with the bad economy, and we get the noise out of the Chinese New Year. So we'll be looking at, how do those measures progress, especially as we get past February.", "Tim Jerzyk", "I think the only thing I would add to this is that what do we have in China in 2009, $1.4 million average unit volumes, 20% margins at KFC, $1.2 million average unit volumes, 19% margins at Pizza Hut. You know, that's pretty good base to build from. You know, that says you have a really, really healthy business, and that you know, we're well positioned. I think the other thing I would say is, do we think we are capacity constrained at KFC and Pizza Hut, absolutely not. We have stores that do twice that volume, those average unit volumes.", "So, you know, we can have $2 million average unit volumes at KFC over time. We can have $2 million average unit volumes at Pizza Hut over time as we become even more dominant in casual dining. So to me, what do you have -- what do you have with KFC and Pizza Hut in China. I think we have two consumer brands everybody wishes they had with unbelievable sales, and unbelievable unit economics, and you know, I think we have a tremendous return that allows us to continue to grow with lots of confidence. And that's the real name in the game for us is to take advantage of the new unit and the development opportunity and grow KFC into well over 10,000 units and grow Pizza Hut as well. So you know, I think that's how we look at the business. We couldn't be happier with where we're at in China, and I think a lot of investors feel the same way.", "David Novak", "I know one measure that gets a lot of attention is the GDP, and what happens to that growth rate and when is your business level around that. Again, I would say there are some analogies between what has happened in China GDP and in the US. A lot of their GDP growth is based on their government stimulus, a lot of it was incentives for people to buy specific goods and people went and did that, and I sort of say similar to the US, but they didn't buy as much stuff that wasn't being offered an incentive.", "So, you know, if you look at the listed economic growth in the fourth quarter in the US, the number greater than 5%. It didn't feel like a 5% from a consumer standpoint, and I think you have the same thing right now happening in China. So we're going to look at broader measures and obviously we were a pretty good bellwether, because we are everywhere in China. So I think we may see it before you see it in all the measures combined anyway.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Hey, John. One other thing. I think you know, David talked about our business on the economic side, the other thing is when you look at the Chinese economy, fundamentally it's one of the strongest in the world. So it is just a matter of when it's going to come back. We feel pretty confident that it will. The amazing thing is as Rick said is that we follow the consumer confidence index. That's one we think is a pretty decent indicator. The amazing part about that is in the fourth quarter of this year was still down versus last year. If you look at fourth-quarter \u201809 versus fourth-quarter \u201808, year-over-year consumer confidence was down. It's starting to show year-over-year improvement, it looks like it. So that's a good sign.", "You know, the export growth, or exports turned from pretty negative most of the year to positive solely in December, and there's lot of people saying that that's going to continue, which will definitely be good. And then also, we actually did see some improvement as the -- David gave you earlier the break in some of the segments of the market. That divergence between central and west and export markets actually narrowed as the year progressed. So there is plenty of signs pointing in the right direction. So it's going to be a matter of time. And also you know, the Chinese consumer has always been a big saver. We all know that. They probably are a little bit more cautious, but like I said all the signs are pointing in the right direction.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan", "Great. Got it. Good color. Thanks guys.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Thank you. Just couple of questions, you talked a little bit about pricing in the US and pricing in YRI, and it sounds like you are, you have no price now in, you know, most of -- most instance. Could you address China also where you're in pricing year-over-year, and then secondly on the KFC US, you said you know, 80% of your franchisees are paying on time, is 20% being late an unusually large number. How does that relate historically? And then lastly the CapEx number for the year came in much lower than we were thinking, about $100 million lower. Does that get pushed into 2010 or you know, what sort of the story with the CapEx?", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, Joe. Let me answer that. On China pricing it is zero, current run rate on pricing and then on the CapEx piece there is going to be no carryover impact to our forecast we provided you for 2010. It was just underspending across a lot of different categories. So it wasn't anything actually in particular, but it was all spread across the actively growing parts of our business, which was YRI in China. So which is the little bit here and there but it will not be something, it wasn't necessarily timing that will be additive to 2010.", "David Novak", "Yes, and regarding the percentage that are late that number is usually, you know, below 10%. So 20% is higher than usual.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Joe. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steve West with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Steve West - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Real quick on the -- when we talk about getting Taco Bell back on track in Drive-Thru Diet, and then what we've seen with the KFC Grilled Chicken, maybe not performing as well as expected early, maybe it is just stabilizing. How would you see kind of the difference between the two and maybe what we should expect as we go forward on getting Taco Bell back on track and even getting KFC back on track here?", "David Novak", "Well, I think you know, Taco Bell like I told you we're very pumped up about what's going on there, and we feel good about the pipeline and, you know, I think that we are going to -- we'll see I think a solid year, okay. I think at KFC, our first half is going to be tough, you know, because we'll be overlapping Kentucky Grilled Chicken, which was easily the most successful new product that was launched in the category last year. So -- but we expect to see steady progress at KFC and, you know, we expect each of our businesses to make more money next year -- this year than they made last year.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "You know, thanks guys. I'll try to keep it quick. Just wondering if you could talk about the percent of cash flow that you generate out the US Pizza Hut and KFC businesses. You mentioned the profits, I just wanted to see if the cash flow mix is similar as well, and also are you having any collection issues at Pizza Hut, you know, given that weak sales we've seen there? And then third, just in terms of the refranchising, particularly KFC, which has been a little slow, do you expect to sell those restaurants to existing franchisees or are you looking for third parties to come and get involved with that system, thanks.", "David Novak", "On the by brand cash flow, it's pretty comparable to profit. The only thing that would be different is there is -- obviously there is higher capital expenditures at Taco Bell. So if you're looking at more of a free cash flow measure, do you have that impact, because we're growing those units and there is some company investment, but otherwise you would pretty well track what the profit is.", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, on the -- your question on the Pizza Hut system is franchisees are in good shape there. They had the commodity benefits in 2009, so they were, you know, making good profits even though they had soft sales. We also have larger franchisees in the Pizza Hut system that are generally well capitalized. So a couple of 1Z, 2Z types of issues but for the most part very solid on the Pizza Hut side, and in general the large franchisees we haven't seen problems.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning. Question for Rick on the tie between the earnings growth outlook for 2010 and the comps plan that you provided. I think at the analyst day you seemed to suggest that you might be able to hit the 10% EPS growth without a 2% comp. You know, so the question is, you know, is that still the case. Do you think you have some room on the cost side if comps fall short, and then secondly what level of comp decline would you start to get nervous about your ability to get to that 10% earnings growth?", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, there is obviously no firm answer I could give on that. I think there is probably no difference from where we were in December from my perspective, and again I think that the assumption that I've been working under is that, if you have a weaker economy than people's expectation is you probably have a bit of a natural hedge on your commodity costs. Then obviously things go the other way then you know, we'll have the upside on the sales piece of it.", "So I think modest increases, decreases I don't expect to change. Anything significant of course you'd have to worry about. I don't have sort of a firm number in my head. I do think that, as we sort of said given the fourth quarter, you know, we're not going through the year with momentum. So clearly, we are really cheering for you know, the economy to pick up and our sales to pick up. And I think we're not starting with momentum, but I feel like David I feel good about our plans for the year.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Very helpful, and if I could squeeze one more in, you mentioned same-store sales expectation is that the growth would be back weighted. How are you thinking about the profitability or the operating income growth, is that also going to be back weighted or the cost being favorable in the first half, would you expect to be more balanced?", "Rick Carucci", "I would say probably what you just said would be my best guess, back end weighted, but not as much as the sales, because we expect the commodities to be favorable in the first quarter.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Great, it is helpful. Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Kristen, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Jeff Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. I'm just wondering if you could give us an update on the signature beverage, new beverage initiatives associated with KFC Crushers, and what your outlook is this year and how important role they might play as you build sales layers, thanks.", "David Novak", "Well, we are in the midst of, you know, expanding the Crusher line across KFC international. So, you know, we are adding to the line different products. This is a product or basically a sub brand that we will continue to add news to as we go over time. And so we're very enthusiastic about it.", "Jeff Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Jeff. Next question please Kristen.", "Operator", "Your final question is from the line of Jeff Farmer with Jefferies & Company.", "Jeff Farmer - Jefferies & Company", "Great. Thank you and good morning. I'm just hoping to get a better understanding of your tax rate. I think you guided to roughly 26% at the Analyst Day for 2010, but just looking at the model, looks like it hasn't been that high since '04. So what factors would actually lead to a higher tax rate for you guys in 2010?", "David Novak", "Well, again we gave sort of -- a rate of 26% is really what we expect to average over the next three years. They could fluctuate from year-over-year and from quarter-to-quarter as it has in the past. We benefited a lot from planning, reconciling audits with the IRS, et cetera, and we still expect to see benefits from those and it's just not quite as large over the next three years as we had over the last two.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Okay. Let me wrap this up. First of all, thanks all of you on the call. You know, as we continue to execute against our global opportunities, our business model will increasingly be driven by China, Yum! Restaurants International and Taco Bell in the US. The restructuring of Pizza Hut and KFC in the US continues and this will ultimately improve our returns as well as the stability and predictability of our cash flow in the US business. We are very focused very, very focused on addressing the strategic challenges of both those brands that we expect will ultimately provide upside from a problem perspective, from our position that we have today.", "Overall, we believe that the execution of our strategies will lead us to a business model that will enable us to continue our track record of consistent performance and achieving at least 10% EPS growth each year. For 2010, we believe that all of our businesses are better off and better prepared to drive sales as the global consumer comes out of what you might characterize as a hunker down mode. Importantly, keep in mind that more than half of our EPS growth will be driven by new units built last year and units to be open in the next several months.", "In china, our business is well positioned for continued growth with its substantial infrastructure advantages, the strong brand positions I've talked about, the new unit investment returns that are as good as ever. So we are in the right place at the right time with the right brands.", "Yum! Restaurants International continues to drive solid growth each year and build its future run rate for growth based on the strength of its broad geography, being in over 110 countries. We've got an extensive franchise growth machine and a leading position in emerging markets around the world, and in particular we are very excited about what's going on in India and France as we highlighted at the annual conference.", "Finally, in the United States we are making progress towards positioning Taco Bell as a significant growth engine driven by both an increase in our average unit volumes, as well as the new unit growth that we expect to drive over time. With all this in mind, we continue to expect EPS growth of at least 10% for 2010, which would mark the ninth consecutive year we would meet our annual target of 10% growth, and we are confident we will continue to build the value of our company not only in 2010, but well beyond.", "It's a great business, and we love running it and building it and thanks for being on the call. I look forward now to talking to our employees around the world. We always have a talk to David call right after this, and I can't wait to tell them about what's going on and convey the excitement that we have for 2010.

My name is Janice and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2010 first quarter earnings conference call. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer session. (Operator instructions)", "At this time, I would like to turn today's conference over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you.", "Mr. Jerzyk, you may begin your conference.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Janice; and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.", "I would also like to advise that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that reflect management\u2019s expectations based on currently available data.

May 18, we will host YRI Investor Day in Dallas; followed by Pizza Hut Investor Day on May 19, also in Dallas. Space is limited, so please notify us if you plan to attend these great events. Also, on Tuesday, July 13, our second quarter earnings will be released and a conference call will follow \u2013 will be held the next morning on July 14.", "On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO, and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. Now I will turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak", "Okay, thanks, Tim; and good morning, everyone. I am pleased that based on our strong first quarter performance, we are well on our way to achieving our ninth straight year of achieving our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth. Our first quarter worldwide operating profit grew by 17% and EPS increased 23% before special items. We are particularly pleased with our business in China, which reported robust profit growth of 37%, driven by both strong unit development and same-store sales growth.", "In the United States, we were also pleased to see the significant sales improvement from the low point of the fourth quarter, particularly at Pizza Hut. However, U.S. profits were down 9% and same-store sales declined 1%.", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we increased system sales by 1% and profits by 2% prior to foreign currency translation, primarily due to new unit development. While clearly we have more work to do, overall, we were pleased with this start to 2010.", "Now, let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions.", "First, let us talk about China, where we continue to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. We are particularly pleased with the performance in our China business. Same-store sales grew by 4%, and units expanded 14%, while restaurant margins were at a record level of nearly 27%. All combined to generate robust profit growth of 37%. This is particularly impressive, when you consider that we were lapping 30% profit growth in the first quarter of last year. New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We opened up 96 new units this quarter, and our China new unit returns continue to be the best in our business. In terms of scale, we surpassed 3500 units, strengthening our leading position in the world's largest growth market.", "KFC is our largest brand in China, with nearly 3000 units in over 650 cities, with superior averaging of volumes of $1.4 million per year. We are continuing to grow our business and leverage our assets. A key KFC initiative is delivery, which is now available in over 110 cities and nearly 1000 units. This is proving to be a developing sales layer for us, now representing over 3% of sales. KFC Breakfast is another way we are leveraging our assets, as we now have national distribution. KFC Breakfast represents nearly 7% of transactions, and continues to steadily grow. Importantly, KFC continues to build its leading image in China across key brand majors.", "Pizza Hut Casual Dining continues to be the leading western casual dining concept in China, with 467 units in 122 cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double digit same-store sales growth. We offer a broad variety of entrees, including beef, chicken, and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages, and desserts. Amazingly, we are actually updating 25% of our menu every six months with new products to keep the concept fresh and relevant. We are having solid success building a true casual dining concept, with everyday affordable value.", "We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands, Pizza Hut's Home Service in the home delivery category, now has over 100 units in 11 cities and East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand continues to progress as we drive for scalable economics.", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere outside of China. New unit development, which like China, is a key driver of growth for this business, and continued with 109 openings this quarter in more than 40 countries. Approximately 90% of this growth came from our strong network of around 1,000 franchisees. We expect to deliver our goal of adding about 900 new units for the full year. Our first quarter same-store sales declined 1%, after adjusting for timing of Chinese New Year's. Overall, we drove 2% operating profit growth, excluding foreign currency translation for the quarter.", "KFC is focusing its attention on driving value around the world to build sales momentum in what remains a somewhat challenging consumer environment. We are expanding our value menu to more markets, using proven strategies that have been very successful in markets like South Africa and the United Kingdom.", "Additionally, we continue to build our new incremental sales layers. Our Crushes line of frozen beverages continues to expand and is now available in over 2000 units in over 25 countries. Our KFC Breakfast initiative, we call it KFC A.M., also continues to grow with nearly 400 units in four markets.", "Pizza Hut continues to make progress, elevating its brand offering and strengthening its position as the leading western casual dining concept, with everyday affordable prices. While we have weaker transaction trends due to Pizza Hut's higher average guest check, we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our expanded menu, including a wider variety of appetizers, beverages, entrees, and desserts.", "Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India, and Russia, delivered 14% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. KFC France opened its 100th unit and is moving towards having the scale to ultimately have national television advertising. We expect this will drive further brand awareness, particularly in the provincial cities. In Russia, we continue to drive sales growth in KFC Rostik's units, and now have over 150 units in 22 cities. Our business in India continues to perform well, with solid same-store sales growth and new unit expansions. We now have 74 KFCs in 13 cities, and 159 Pizza Huts in 33 cities. KFC is now leveraging television advertising to build brand awareness and promote new products in India.", "Taco Bell International continues to expand, with our first unit in Bangalore, India in that country's largest mall, Mantri Mall. You might have read in the Wall Street Journal that our initial sales at this store has been extremely strong, and transactions have actually exceeded 1000 per day. The results from other recent openings in Spain, Dubai, Cyprus, and Panama, have also been very encouraging, with our stores comfortably exceeding sales targets. Looking ahead, we are on track to open two new Taco Bell units in London in the second quarter and expect to open new markets like Korea, Kuwait, Peru, and Columbia later this year.", "Next, onto our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency, and returns. As we noted in our earnings release, performance in our U.S. business for the first quarter was relatively weak, with same-store sales down 1%, and operating profit down 9%. But we were pleased with the significant improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009.", "Pizza Hut led the way with 5% same-store sales growth, driven by the success of the $10.00 Any Way You Want It promotion. There is no doubt America loves Pizza Hut pizzas, so this has addressed our number one problem, we were simply too expensive, and now, we are working on ways to sustain this value. Going forward, we are also striving to transform Pizza Hut from just pizza to pizza, pasta, and wings. Tuscani Tuesdays offers consumers Pizza Hut's pastas at a great value of $10.00 and Wing Wednesdays offers consumers Pizza Hut's award-winning chicken wings also at great value. Pizza Hut has clearly turned the corner on sales trends.", "At Taco Bell, we were disappointed with the 2% decline in same-store sales, but encouraged by the fact that our transactions were positive for the quarter. We had experienced some trade down with less drink and combo incidents. Taco Bell's pipeline of products is strong for the balance of the year, focusing on value to the consumer in a market clearly focused on everyday low prices.", "KFC's performance improved sequentially, but we still have our work cut out for us. We are focused on three key areas as we turn the brand around, balanced options featuring Kentucky Grilled Chicken; portable product innovation like the new Double Down Sandwich made from two boneless fillets, grilled or fried; and improved operations.", "Overall, our U.S. performance has improved from the low point of the fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue, especially as we move into the second half of the year, both in terms of our top line sales, and profit performance.", "One other note. I am sure that you also noticed from our release that we took a non-cash charge that basically reflects the beginning of refranchising KFC to 5% ownership. That is also our goal for Pizza Hut, where we have already begun the journey, and are well on our way.", "So let me wrap up the first quarter. Overall, by saying we are off to a strong start in 2010. While the global operating environment remains challenging, we are especially pleased with the strong performance in our China business, and the improving trends we are seeing in our U.S. business, which we expect to continue to build as the year progresses. We are confident we are well on our way to delivering another year of at least 10% earnings per share growth, which would be our ninth year in a row of meeting or exceeding this target.", "Now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Rick Carucci", "Thank you, David; and good morning. In this section of our call, I am going to comment on three areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for the business during the balance of 2010, and our strategy in emerging markets.", "As David mentioned, we are very excited about our first quarter results. I am sure any CFO will tell you that they would much prefer a strong start than having to play catch-up. As we review a few of our highlights, let us start with China.", "We had a very strong Chinese New Year holiday. This led to first quarter system sales growth of 15%, including same-store sales growth of 4%. Sales were solid across the country, including the high export regions. While we are not yet ready to say that the Chinese consumer has fully recovered, we are starting to see signs that the consumer environment is improving. As an example, consumer confidence in China has increased year-over-year the last three months. A big driver of sales continues to be our development results in China. New unit economics remains strong and we expect that we will continue to expand broadly across China. Our profit growth of 37% was also driven by record first quarter margins, as we benefited significantly from chicken cost deflation versus prior year, and lower-than-trend wage inflation.", "Now on to Yum! Restaurants International. Overall, our sales results were relatively weak in our large developed markets like Japan and Canada, as well as equity business like Australia and Mexico. These markets dampened the overall sales results for YRI in the quarter. The good news is that YRI still benefited from broad-based new unit development of 3% in the first quarter. However, this led to only 2% profit growth prior to currency translation. We did benefit from a $14 million Forex item in the first quarter, which resulted in YRI reported profit growth of 13%.", "Next, in the U.S., we continued to battle high unemployment and an industry focused on value. However, our U.S. business realized significantly better sales performance than we saw in the fourth quarter. On the whole, our U.S. restaurant margin declined 90 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to the decline in same-store sales. Commodity deflation of $5 million was offset by a modest impact from sales mix shift. For example, Taco Bell experienced a higher mix on the Why Pay More menu and had lower drink incidents. While trying to improve our value offerings, we also managed our business with tight cost management. In the U.S., we reduced our G&A by $6 million. When you pull it all together, we are pleased with where we stand after the first quarter.", "Now, let me share with you some of our thoughts for the remainder of 2010. We expect our second quarter sales dynamics to be similar to the first quarter for our divisions. We expect moderate same-store sales growth in China in the second quarter. For the U.S., in the second half of the year, we expect positive sales growth. The key reason is that our comparisons versus prior year gets significantly easier. Remember, we are lapping a second half where U.S. sales were down 7% in 2009. We do not expect China's exceptional margin performance in the first quarter to continue. We expect some commodity inflation in the back half of the year, and we also forecast greater impact from wage inflation. Wage inflation was lower than normal in 2009 and is significantly picking up again in 2010. For the full year, we expect moderate year-over-year margin improvement over last year's 21% margins in Mainland China.", "Our after-tax results in the second quarter will be challenged, as we roll over a 16.4% effective tax rate before special items from the second quarter of 2009. Special items are very difficult to predict and can be quite lumpy. However, this year it appears that we have more downsides than upsides. During the first quarter, we took a special items charge that included a $56 million expense from U.S. refranchising. This includes gains from the sale of 46 restaurants sold in the first quarter. This also reflects that we floated for sale a significant number of KFC U.S. company units. Our accounting policy is to recognize a non-cash write-off for potential losses from refranchising when units are offered for sale.", "In the second quarter, we will also lap a $68 million one-time non-cash gain in 2009 related to increasing our ownership in the KFC Shanghai joint venture. Overall, as David said, we are confident we are on track to meeting our objective of at least 10% earnings per share growth.", "As we have shared with you before, one of Yum's unique strength is our presence in emerging markets. Today, I would like to give you a few more insights into this significant growth opportunity. Emerging markets, as defined by World Bank's guidelines, generally includes countries whose gross national income per capita is less than $12,000. This group includes countries like China, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Russia, Vietnam, and Brazil, all of which have near or over 100 Yum! restaurants. The good news is that collectively, these emerging markets are growing their economies at a fast rate. With a booming middle class population in emerging markets, we strongly believe there is a long run rate for restaurant growth in those countries. As you may recall, I have talked about our penetration of three units per million people internationally, versus the 60 units per million we have in the U.S. Further, in the top 10 emerging markets, we currently have 1.5 units per million people. This demonstrates that we are clearly on the ground floor of this huge growth opportunity.", "Today, we have nearly 10,000 units in the emerging markets, or roughly 55% of our total YRI and China units. We are the largest restaurant company in emerging markets, and we are growing at a faster rate than our major QSR competition. With a five year period ending in 2009, we added about 4,000 net new units in these markets, a 12% compound annual growth rate. This compares to a 1% compound annual growth rate in the balance of our international operations.", "As another benchmark, we currently have almost two times the number of emerging market units as McDonald's, and we have added more net units than McDonald's at a 3 to 1 rate during the past five years. And here is another important point. Most of our competitors aren't even trying to open restaurants in many of these emerging markets. Our experience is that it usually takes about 10 years to get to 100 units in a new country. This is the point at which you could begin to scale a concept as you have a proven consumer proposition, a more efficient supply chain, and access to mass media such as television. Overall, for emerging markets, Yum! enjoys the combination of an existing lead in penetration, a higher growth rate, and the knowledge of the lead times it would take others to have a meaningful presence in these markets. This provides Yum! with an opportunity to increase our competitive advantage that will likely last for a very long time. In the upcoming calls and investor meetings, we plan to provide more color commentary around our growth opportunities in emerging markets.", "In summary, given our plans and our first quarter results, we believe Yum! is well positioned to once again deliver solid financial performance in 2010. At the same time, we are equally excited about the foundation we are building in emerging markets to drive strong performance for many years to come.", "Back to you, David.", "David Novak", "All right. Thank you very much, Rick, and let us open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Jeff Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. I just had two questions on the domestic business. First, on the Pizza Hut value effort, I want to give a little more color on the \u2013 in fact, I am checking mix of the $10.00 promo. And given the response, do you think you will extend the LTO beyond the original plan, how are you thinking about sustaining value there going forward? And I have one more question, thanks.", "Rick Carucci", "Okay, well, Jeff, as you know, you know, we posted strong sales in the first quarter of 5% and the promotion has been very successful and the reason is it has addressed our biggest problem, which is value. You know, I think that what we have seen is that our comparable margins have held steady, as we have had the sales lift and we have had strong flow through, which has offset a lot of the price discounting that we typically have had this with this promotion, obviously. And the good news for us is that the brand metrics have really held solid, so the brand is in fact improving in terms of its consumer perspective. So, what we are doing right now is we are looking and working very hard with our franchisees on ways to sustain our everyday value proposition. And the franchisees are very committed to this, but it does seem that the turnaround in the business and the power of making our brand more affordable and accessible to the vast majority of customers.", "David Novak", "And Jeff, just regarding your question on check, check was down about, you know, close to about 10%, but the transactions increased at a much faster rate than that.", "Jeff Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. And my other question was on Taco Bell. Just how are you assessing the consumer response to the Pacific Shrimp Taco? I am asking this because of the new protein efforts there and should we expect to see more efforts along those lines? Thanks.", "Rick Carucci", "You know, I think that the product response to the product has been \u2013 or the consumer response to the product has been very good. People like the product itself, and we actually had some product supply issues because the shrimp tacos basically flew off the shelves. So, I think it is the first time we ever had a fish product during Lent, which made a lot of sense, so I think that you will see that on a targeted in and out basis, as we go forward.", "Jeff Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks.", "Rick Carucci", "Okay.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jeff. Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning, it's David Tarantino. Congratulations on a great start to the year. My question is on China. I was wondering if you could give more granularity on your thoughts on what is happening in the consumer environment. You mentioned you are not ready to call a recovery in the Chinese consumer yet. Your results were pretty strong in the quarter. So, my question is, what is giving you pause on calling for that recovery?", "David Novak", "Yes, when we look at China, we look at a bunch of different measures from an economic standpoint. One of the things I highlighted in my speech is one of the things we look at is consumer confidence and that has gone up the last three months, which is good, but it is still below what it would have been, I would call it about a year or a year-and-a-half ago. So, you know, we still have ways for it to go. We are starting to see exports rise as well. Governments, local governments are confident enough to start to increase wages again at a pretty high rate, which puts us on the margin side, but it is an indication that the people are starting to feel more bullish about the economy. You still have the push towards the central and west that we have talked about before and those economies are still doing a bit better than the coastal economies and we will continue to move some of our development in that direction. You know, I would say it\u2019s better than it was, but not, you know, not what it was, let us say before things started going south.", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, very helpful. And one follow-up question on that is, are you seeing anything since the close of your first quarter that would suggest that type of low to mid-single digit comp would not be sustainable for the rest of the year?", "Rick Carucci", "Well, what we sort of said is for the second quarter, we expect similar types of numbers, and we call something out of it is a significant difference, but we haven't seen a significant change since the first quarter.", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Great, thank you.", "David Novak", "Remember, last time, we called out Pizza Hut, but we don't call out a couple of points up or down.", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, David. Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer \u2013 UBS", "Hi, guys, sorry for the background noise, kind of on the road here. I wanted to ask you a question about the U.S. business. You know, just a little general question, I mean, obviously, the cost for that first quarter was down significantly. You are not going to get any favors from food costs from this point forward as much. You know, it might be the trend in sales that makes you feel better, but you know obviously the starting point in terms of trend rate on profit was not exactly a great one. How do you feel, you know, what is the feeling about this U.S. business profit wise for the year? Obviously, you are not up to giving guidance, but any comments would be helpful.", "Rick Carucci", "You know, just to put some of the sales and profits and commodities and inflation in perspective, we, you know, remember what I said, put it in my speech is, our overlaps get significantly easier the second half of the year. So we are not necessarily assuming a great economic recovery for our sales to get better. We started lapping -7% in the second half of 2009. So we are still running the business as if things are going to be pretty tight with the consumer and you know, things are better than they were for us obviously in the third quarter or fourth quarter last year. But, you know, we have still have ways \u2013 you know, we still have a ways to go before we are going to say there is an economic recovery in the U.S.", "On the commodity side, we had a little bit of commodity deflation in the first quarter. Our current guess is that it will be about flat for the full year. So we don't see a huge difference there. So we will continue to try to do what we do in these types of times, as when we have value initiatives, we try to have some great product initiatives, because obviously you need to have innovation as well, and then we will manage to cross three types and we are looking at both productivity initiatives at all of our brands and I think the team has done a pretty good job of managing those costs. In terms of the profits in the first quarter, our overall sales were down 1%, our company sales were down 2%, so that is probably why the profits, if you put that in perspective is really why we were down 9%. So given the -2% in company, that is pretty much where we would expect to be, given that sales level.", "David Novak", "And I think, David, in the end, as we look at how it all adds up, we are still comfortable with saying that we can grow our profits 5% in the U.S.", "David Palmer \u2013 UBS", "Thanks. And congrats on the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Great, thanks. Yes, and good quarter, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the pizza category in the U.S.? Who do you think you are taking share from and how sustainable do you think that is going to be over the next few quarters?", "David Novak", "Well, I think what we have done is we have made ourselves much more competitive on the pricing front, and that is we are seeing our gains coming. Usually when we grow like we are growing right now, it comes from the overall category, and the mom and pops.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "And do you think over the next few quarters, this could be sustainable, or do you think you have seen some marketing and more exposure by consumers to good promotions, maybe that fizzles out or do you think that is going to be a sustainable \u2013?", "David Novak", "I think the category has always been enormously competitive and always, especially on the pricing front, and I think that the fact that we are being more competitive on the pricing front today and the fact that the system is committed to that, means that we should have more sustainability in our overall brand over time.", "Greg Badishkanian \u2013 Citigroup", "Great, thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Jefferies and Company.", "Jeff Farmer \u2013 Jefferies and Company", "Great, thank you. Good morning. You guys have been running without menu pricing in China for at least six months according to my model. What is the opportunity in coming quarters, especially if you expect to see some inflation in the back half of 2010?", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, we are obviously looking at that now, we are trying to balance. You know, again, as we sort of said before, the Chinese consumer is still soft. We had, obviously, a very favorable first quarter, because as we mentioned, the labor was unusually low, costs were unusually low. So we will have to look at that, but you know, the good news is we have got some very positive profits going into that timeframe, but we are studying what we want to do now for the back half of the year, but we are not going to do anything at least for the next several months.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next question, please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes, thanks guys. Just wondered if you could update us on the KFC business in the U.S. You know, last quarter, you talked about some of the franchisees were behind in making royalty payments. You guys had a fairly sizable charge there. You didn't see one of those this quarter. If there is some improvement you are seeing there, and then talk about the likelihood that you get a big transaction done or multiple transactions done on the refranchising side as well as the success of the new products you just launched, thanks.", "Rick Carucci", "Well, on the bad debts side, we are going to keep our eye on that it, it actually did a little better in the first quarter. So our receivables are better and hopefully, we get into a higher seasonals time as the year gets over. So keeping our eye on that, but probably a bit better than we were in the fourth quarter. Regarding refranchising, just to put that into context again for people who may not be as familiar, you know, we were on a three year refranchising program that really started in the beginning of 2008, and our goal was to go from over 20% of our U.S. restaurants for company owned to about 10%, which as David said, about 5% at the KFC and Pizza Hut level.", "In the first two years of that, we finished Long John Silver refranchising. As David said, we are well on our way on Pizza Hut, and we think we will be close to finishing that within the original three year timeframe, which would have ended in 2010, and then what we said in December is that we are behind on KFC. We started late on KFC, and therefore, we think the total program will take a bit longer than we originally thought.", "So KFC, we really just started in earnest this quarter, in terms of loading deals. So, we will have to see how, we have a lot of work to do on that stuff, we are just hearing some potential buyers, so we have a long way to go on that side. So we are going after it, so we now think it is the right time to market. We think the brand is performing better than it was a while back and you know, we are excited about some of the product initiatives that we have done and that we are going to do going forward.", "David Novak", "Just from an overall business perspective, you know, KFC continues to be our biggest challenge in the second quarter, we will likely be negative as we overlap last year's successful Kentucky Grilled Chicken launch. However, we have got some really good programs, including the launch of the Double Down Sandwich, which we just introduced and we have a Pink Bucket promotion coming up, where we donate $0.50 of every bucket sold to fight breast cancer, which we feel very good about as well. As we move forward, we are really focused on more innovation around portable products and high end offerings. So we are going to leverage both our grilled and fried and boneless offerings, as we go forward. So for the full year, you know, we expect to see improvements in sales and definitely more profitability as we go forward.", "The other thing we are very focused on and passionate about and Roger Eaton is leading the charge on this at KFC is that we are improving operations and because we see that definitely as our single biggest opportunity to drive sustainable same-store sales growth. So, you know, there is a lot of work going on right now. We put our best leaders that we have around the company. We have brought in a lot of talent at KFC, we are totally passionate toward turning around the U.S. business and I am really proud of the efforts that are going on, but there is a lot of wood to chop, so to speak.", "Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks for the color, guys.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jason. Next question, please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks. Two questions. My first one is on YRI. Can you just walk through a couple of the key markets there and why you think your sales has remained somewhat soft, for example the Australian market, maybe a little commentary on the UK as well, please?", "Rick Carucci", "Well, I think you know YRI in Australia has had a real strong run, great track record of consistency, and you know frankly, I think we have fallen a little bit behind on the pipeline in the innovation that we had typically had coming out of Australia. And so, we expect that business to perform better and it should. The brand is very strong there and we have tremendous opportunity to keep growing as well. In the UK, we are very pleased with the progress that we have made with KFC. KFC had an outstanding year last year in the United Kingdom, you know, where we were up double digits in sales and profits. And you know, the KFC business is beginning to build some momentum there. Pizza Hut, you know, is our big challenge there. We are in the midst of really trying to transform and turn that brand around, become a stronger casual, affordable casual dining entry or competitor, and I think we are really more in the early days of really making a substantial change there. The team is on it, but we have got more work to do.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And just as it relates to the inflation that you are expecting commodities in China, and wages, can you maybe quantify what kind of increases you would expect in the back half and even this quarter with a 4% comp increase, it looks like you would de-lever things like payroll and occupancy. So what kind of comp do you need this year in China in order to offset those increases and those fixed costs?", "Rick Carucci", "Well, in terms of the wages again, just background again, as we had some good labor initiatives from the productivity side in China in 2009, and then in the second half of 2009 in particular, the government really, this is mostly local governments, really didn't take out minimum wages. They had very small increases in minimum wages. So in the first half of this year, we are benefiting from that and like I said, we are going to get ahead with this probably harder than normal in the second half of the year. So we increased versus prior year in the first quarter 2.5 margin points and what we set for the full year is we will have a moderate increase. So in terms of sales, we don't have an exact sales number is what you need, but probably modest same-store sales growth in order to deliver that kind of margin improvement for the full year.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Are we just going up at double rates right now or do you expect them to this year? What is the order of magnitude of wage increase do you think?", "Rick Carucci", "Well, I think what is happening is we benefited, as I said, in the first part of the year, we had lower than normal. So normally, the wages in China, if you go over about a four year period, they are in the 8% to 10% level. We actually had rates lower than that in the first half of this year, and expected to be higher than that in the balance of the year. That is probably an average of about 10% or so for the full year.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, John. Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, thank you, it is Sara Senatore. Just actually a couple of sort of disparate follow-ups here. First, on pizza, I think you said that you thought that the share gains were coming from independents maybe, I mean all the publicly traded, you know, pizza guys, or other guys reported actually big improvements in costs. So, I guess, you know, at some point, those share gains have to level off. So I was just wondering, you know, is there any other place that you can get the market growth from, I think actually one of your competitors said that the market has been in decline for something like 10 years, and now it is actually turning positive. So I am just trying to figure out, again if there is, you know, the sort of sustainability. So that is the one follow up, and then I have another on China.", "Rick Carucci", "I think one of the big things we have in marketing as you guys all know, there is nothing like the power of having the leading brand with the leading image. And when your are value competitive, your odds of success are much better. So you know, this has always been a slug it out, very competitive share gain and category. What we are trying to do is have a two-fold strategy. One is to be much more competitive in the pizza world, which we have done. And you know, the real challenge we have now is to drive sustainable everyday value as we go into the future and the team is working very hard on how to stay competitive on the value front, because we have seen the real power of it.", "But the other thing we are trying to do is that we have tremendous opportunity to leverage our assets with the variety that we have invested in the last couple of years. For us, that means establishing the pasta occasion and the wing occasion as separate and distinct occasions for Pizza Hut and marketing them primarily during the week, so that we leverage the assets that we have. So, our strategy is to fight it out for share in the pizza category, leverage our leadership and now competitive value, and then, leverage the asset that is definitely under-utilized at Pizza Hut through the variety that we have created, the pasta and the wings, by really going after the earlier week occasion.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks. And then just on China, I just want an update on the new unit volume versus existing insofar there obviously you did 4% comps, 14% unit growth and your total systemized sales growth was less than the sum of that. So are we still looking at sort of a $200,000 difference in new unit volumes and can you talk about what the ramp is generally for units as they come online, just you know, apples-to-apples is a new unit less, lower volume than what it may be in year two or three?", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, I mean, generally, we have been at this strength for a few years now, which is our average unit volumes are about 1.4 million and new units come in probably about 1 million, 1.1 million. Right? So we are at about a 300,000 gap versus a new unit, and that strength has been going on for a while, and part of that as we go into smaller cities, where we have a little bit more inflows as we are developing into existing cities, and that is the reason why there are lower sales levels. We sort of said before as you get to the smaller cities, the good news is, even with those lower sales, our margins are similar, because our cost structures are lower there. In terms of ramp-up, it is hard, because we have so many new units are coming in on top of each other, but our sales rates are generally a bit higher in the smaller cities as we open. So they will tend to grow at a higher rate in the first, let us say, four or five, years than the general cities would.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Sara. Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Great, thank you. A couple of questions as well. One, just on the U.S. business, you haven't talked much about Taco Bell. I think you said you were somewhat disappointed with the down 2% comp. Just wondering whether you could talk a little bit more about, I think you said this was a new trend of people skewing more towards the Why Pay More and perhaps less drink incidents. Just wondering whether you could talk about that specific to Taco Bell and whether, you know, what the impact has been from the competitive discounting kind of jumping into Taco Bell's kind of more discounted push, just trying to size up the Taco Bell business, and then I had a follow-up question.", "Rick Carucci", "Okay. Well, first of all, we will always be disappointed with any kind of negative same-store sales growth. So, you know, clearly we were down 2% in the first quarter. As you know, the overall industry trends have been negative since June of 2009, and you know, we do have the strongest value position in the category. What we saw in the first quarter was that our transactions were positive, but we did have a lower average guest check, less drinks and combo meals. And you know, we also have, most of our media spend was on the value, the $0.89 beefy five-layer burrito, and so we did have the Why Pay More usage increase to about 20% of our mix versus the 15% of the mix. So this is like \u2013 this is, you know, what we were able to obviously maintain. Perhaps, we haven't seen the research yet, even fortify the value position that we know is going to be really essential as we go forward. And we were able to do it in a competitive category, where you are basically, you point out the issue, more and more people are at the low end.", "What we really are pleased about is that we had positive transactions. So more people are coming to Taco Bell this year than last year, and so we can build off of that strength. Our biggest challenge is to get same-store sales growing again at Taco Bell. You know, we are obviously happy that the transaction has picked up, but you know, it is much easier to build your sales off of positive transactions. So we believe, as we look at our programs and our initiatives, that our value and our innovation is strong enough for us to get modest same-store sales growth for the balance of the year. And as we pointed out at the Analyst Meeting that we had in New York, we are also extremely enthusiastic about the results we are getting from our more longer term initiatives, breakfast, home meal replacement, beverages, these big sales layers, we have a lot of big ideas in test that we are feeling better and better about as we go forward.", "So, we are very optimistic about the future of this brand. You know, we think we can get modest same-store sales growth for the balance of the year, but let us slug it out. I mean, it is definitely a slug-it-out category right now. What we are most excited about is just the long-term prospects of Taco Bell, where we begin to add some of these sales layers that we are talking about that we think can actually help us become a net new unit developer of Taco Bell. So brands, moving along, competing well in a very tough category with all kinds of upside.", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, and just a separate question as it relates to China, the positive 4% comp, I know last quarter you were hesitant to really call much in the way of trends in China because of the whole New Year shift. And with that now behind us, I think you feel that the New Year shift was pretty strong. Are you able to size up how much of that 4% came from New Year's and kind of otherwise assess the underlying trend or you really can\u2019t even take a stab at it until we do another couple of months?", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, it is really hard to, and that is why we sort of said before, and I still believe that we will have a better handle as we get through this quarter other than Chinese New Year. We had a very strong holiday, and so that was a good sign, but we haven't seen, we just need a longer period of time before we can judge beyond that.", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jeff. Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, thanks. I wanted to revisit YRI and the sales performance over the last couple of quarters, and I guess, you know, we don't have a lot of data points, but you look at results like, you know, out of Dominoes, out of McDonald's, even out of Starbucks for example, and their international results are much better, from a same-store sales perspective, even if they are developing units in certain markets. So I mean, can you just kind of go back, you know, to YRI and talk about, you know, I think you mentioned kind of getting back on the new product pipeline in Australia, but is there anything that is really going to change from a management perspective in terms of, you know, core competencies like product development, advertising, operations, maybe even remodels? I mean is there is something that you think really needs to be redone in that marketplace is kind of the first part. And then secondly, you know, looking at the company's store margins in YRI, they continue to be under pressure, and you know, last year, it was evidently because commodity prices were contracted at the same time, but we are not really seeing relief in margins overall there, so if you can just comment on focus on company store margins in the YRI division as well, thanks.", "David Novak", "All right, John. You know, there is no question that YRI is off to a slow start with comps down 2% and we have got work to do to regain our sales. So you point out the issue and definitely we are on the case. We are focusing on value, primarily in developed markets, given the tough environment. What we are doing is, we are taking a lot of the know how that we have on permanent value menus from the success of markets like in South Africa, which is we have a streetwise menu and we are expanding that successfully into the UK, where it now has like 14% of the mix and a significant amount of incremental sales.", "We are also revisiting our core signature items with new insights on products that are very unique in the marketplace, our Twister and our Singer sandwiches for example. And we have also put together an initiative where we are launching regional successes from the past into new markets, like the Wrap Star sandwich, Fillers, and Hot Rods, these are promotions that have done well in other markets that we will be moving into new markets. So we are trying to roll out and expand the proven winners into more geographies. We also are continuing to roll out new incremental sales layers. So Crushers, which is our line of frozen beverages is now in 2000 units and we are shooting to have it at 4000 units by the end of the year. So we expect that to give us a bit of a lift. And we are hopeful that we will see a better half, a better second half in 2010. You know, our first half lap was plus 4% of sales and the second half is minus 1%. So we are hopeful that with the initiatives we have got going, we will be able to see better performance in YRI. So you know, we are definitely on the case. I think the team, our management is working on the right things, and you know, we are going to make progress.", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, regarding your question on the margins, John, that is pretty much driven by where we had sales weakness and strength. Your point is not really driven by commodities. Commodities don't have the shifts in YRI that we have had in the U.S. or China over the last few years. So as we said before, they are relatively flat. So, a couple of our businesses, like Pizza Hut UK, as David said, in his speech and comments, they have been under-performing and that hurt our overall YRI margins. And Pizza Hut in the UK is, you know higher transaction businesses and the economy is a little soft. Our experience is they usually suffer a little bit more. So the margins have pretty much followed the sales in this case, so Australia is an equity business, as David said, it isn't performing as well as normal and you saw that in the release. So that has also hurt on the margin side. So Australia, and Pizza Hut UK are two of the countries that brought the margin down in the first quarter.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan", "And in terms of that value menu, I mean, how significant will that be across YRI in 2010, I mean, what is the timing of some of that? The value menu?", "Rick Carucci", "It is hard to quantify, because, you know, John, we have been doing value for a while. So quite a few countries already have sort of a value menu. So what they are trying to do is to bring those learnings to other markets, it is done sequentially, so it is not like we have a launch of value July 1. A lot of countries have already had it; we are introducing it in more countries as we speak. So there is not an event that we could really quantify easily.", "John Ivankoe \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, John. Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Banc of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joe Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thank you. Two questions as well. In China, was there any natural advantage to the New Year falling in February as opposed to January, or is it immaterial which month it falls in?", "David Novak", "It doesn't really matter that much. It is just more a function of, you know, we have lap in terms of outside of China YRI, because sometimes it falls in the quarter, out of the quarter. But we really haven't seen anything dramatic in shifts between January and February.", "Joe Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And the plus 4% in mainland China, were transactions up more than that, was check actually down, or would check be flattish and transactions up around 4%?", "Rick Carucci", "I don't have the exact numbers, but it is similar.", "Joe Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Rick Carucci", "Transactions would have been similar to sales.", "Joe Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And lastly, there was some story I was reading about some Internet coupon deal that kind of went awry in China. Is that anything to be concerned about, or is that kind of a minor PR bump in the road?", "David Novak", "We made a couponing error and caused some concern to some customers. We apologized for doing that. It is a short term issue.", "Joe Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, two questions on healthcare. Any sense of the cost for Yum!, and then any pushback from franchisees in terms of buying units, you know, with the prospect of higher healthcare costs out of the not-so-distant future?", "David Novak", "Joe, this year, we anticipate a small impact of about $6 million for the loss of tax reductions for retiree medical benefits. The major impact of this legislation will hit in 2014 and, you know, with our anticipated ownership change, we are going to 5% ownership with Pizza Hut and KFC. By 2014, we think it is going to cost Yum! about $20 million to $30 million based on the existing work force structure that we anticipate. So, as you know, there is lots of legislative details to be ironed out in the next couple of years. The real challenge is that this is going to be about $10,000 to $15,000 per store cost to our franchisees, beginning in 2014. And we are going to work with them to mitigate the cost. So, we have got plenty of time I think to deal with the issue, but it certainly is an issue and you know, I think all this is well understood by any franchisee who would be purchasing stores.", "Joe Buckley \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Joe, next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Thanks. I want to ask a question about Taco Bell. We have walked through the top line initiatives and earlier in the call, you talked about how some of the domestic margin impacts came from the deleverage at Taco Bell. I wanted to ask you if you could give a little bit more detail on the status and opportunity behind the four wall cost save initiative at Taco Bell that Greg Creed laid out at the December Analyst Day. So any details on the status and opportunity there would be appreciated. Thanks.", "David Novak", "Keith, they have actively implemented all those things. So you are seeing that, saw that part of the results of that last year and you are seeing the continuing benefit now.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then, one other question. The charge for the KFC units that are looking to be refranchised, was this for all of the units, like all 600 that you hope to refranchise, was this just a portion? And if it is just a portion, roughly how many was discharged in relation to how many units?", "David Novak", "We have just sort of said it is a significant portion. So it is the lion's share of what we think we are going to be doing.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Keith. Next question please, Janice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thanks very much, and just another question on China. Just trying to get a sense, with comps up 4% in the first quarter, that was versus an up 2%. And you are saying similar trends, yet the comparison is a whole lot easier I believe that was down 4% in the second quarter last year. If you go back two years, I think the comparisons were similar. So can you maybe just drill down a little bit deeper into why you think the trends would not accelerate? It sounds like you are being conservative, but is there anything that happened in the first quarter on the positive side that maybe doesn't flow through into the second quarter?", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, Mitch, I mean, we have tried to look at this like you have in different ways. One year or two year, three years actually is sometimes the best way to look at it. And so, I wouldn't overstate the prior year trend. Just remember, last year was sort of an unusual year for China in terms of how people reacted to the economy, more violently than usual. I think as we look at this year, we just sort of, you know, in total, we told you what we believe as we expect moderate growth off of those numbers that you saw in the same quarter last year.", "Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Fair enough. And a separate question. I was \u2013 in the segment data, corporate expenses I believe came in at around $30 million in the first quarter. It was versus $46 million last year. So that definitely added a couple of cents to earnings. On the corporate expense side, is this $30 million per quarter run rate, is this, should we expect that going forward or was it unusually low in the first quarter and it will renormalize?", "Rick Carucci", "Yes, it was unusually low. We had an unusually large upside in the first quarter. What we said in December for the full year in the U.S., I will talk to U.S. as well as the Yum! piece of it. On the U.S. side, we saw about a $6 million reduction in G&A. What we said at the beginning of the year, is we expect the impact from refranchising to be in the $20 million range and we thought that we would be able to offset that money through G&A savings, right? So the $6 million in the U.S. and sort of the $13 million in unallocated, we are pretty much at that point now. We will probably get a little bit more upsides the rest of the year, but not nearly as large as what it was the first quarter.", "Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Okay, thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Mitch. Janice, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Steve West with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Matt Van Vliet \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, hi, guys, this is Matt Van Vliet for Steve this morning. Just a question on Pizza Hut and I guess the thought going forward on the next round of promotions, is the $10.00 price point something that is important to keep, whether you limit offerings or just kind of change the messaging there and keep that $10.00 price point or do you feel the sort of variability of getting whatever you want on a pizza is more important than you might raise the price there, maybe just thoughts on that and the potential to really bundle the pasta and the wings and the pizza together, it seems like most of the messaging out there is one or the other and I know you have talked about generating separate occasions for each of those, but maybe just your thoughts on the bundling as well. Thanks.", "David Novak", "Well, I think that most important thing is relative value. You know, obviously, the $10.00 pizza Any Way You Want It is in the strong relative value, and we are working on ways to keep that alive. This is a very competitive category, so the last thing I would do is tell everybody what we are going to be doing. But I think obviously relative value is the real key here. We are more into creating separate occasions than necessarily bundling. If bundling happens with pasta and chicken, fine, but we think the bigger idea is to try to create separate occasions. I hope that was helpful.", "Matt Van Vliet \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Good, all right. Thank you.", "David Novak", "All right. Let me wrap things up briefly. You know, just some closing comments here. We continue to execute against our global growth opportunities, both in China as well as Yum! Restaurants International, with our leading industry new unit expansion. Our focus is global, which is particularly strong in emerging markets like China and India. KFC is a leading western brand in many emerging markets and the fastest growing western brand and we are very pleased to be so well positioned in the fastest growing economies of the world, with expanding middle class populations as Rick pointed out earlier.", "In the United States, we are making progress, competing in a tough macro environment. We are encouraged by recent sales trends at each of our brands, but know that we have plenty of opportunity to drive value and innovation as we improve operations. We are continuing to make solid progress against our goal of reducing U.S. company ownership to 10% or less, targeting ownership of 5% of both Pizza Hut and KFC.", "In closing, 2010 is off to a good start. We had a good quarter and we expect to deliver our target of at least 10% EPS per share. So thank you all for participating in the call. We appreciate the good questions.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions.]", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tim Jerzyk, senior vice president of investor relations. ", "", "Tim Jerzyk", "Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website at www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.", "I would also like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements.

December 8 we will host our annual investor and analyst conference in New York. Registration is required and you will be receiving more information on the conference soon. Wednesday, February 2, 2011 fourth quarter earnings will be released.", "On our call today you will hear from David Novak, chairman and CEO; and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak", "Thank you very much Tim, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that tomorrow, October 7, is our company's Founder's Day and marks our 13th anniversary since we were spun off from PepsiCo. I especially want to thank all of our shareholders who have been with us since day one.", "From the beginning, our formula for success has been people capability first. Satisfied customers and profitability follow. I'm proud of our \"how we win together\" ownership culture and the results that we've generated. In 13 years we've seen our stock price increase 600%, and I'm happy to say every one of our annual stock option grants are in the money for our team members.", "Our people know the three keys to driving shareholder value, and believe me, we are focused on them - new unit development, same-store sales growth, and return on invested capital. We continue to believe we have the best new unit opportunity in China, India, Russia, and other emerging markets. We also have unparalleled opportunity to grow same-store sales with our 37,000 restaurants, by developing day parts and making our brands even more relevant. Meanwhile, our returns should continue to be the best in retail.", "I often say the best thing about business is the unfinished business, and clearly we're in the early innings of our growth and quest to become the defining global company that feeds the world.", "Now on to our results. I'm pleased to report we are raising our full-year EPS growth forecast to 14% from 12%, which will make 2010 the ninth consecutive year we meet or exceed our annual target of at least 10%. We take satisfaction that our year to date operating profit has increased 15%, excluding special items and the impact of foreign currency translation and is driving our strong EPS growth this year. ", "Our third quarter operating profit growth of 14%, excluding special items, was fueled by new unit development in China and Yum! Restaurants International. We are particularly pleased with our China business, which reported robust profit growth of 23%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. ", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we grew operating profit 16%, prior to foreign currency translation benefit. In the U.S. we saw modest same-store sales growth in what remains a tough environment. While our U.S. profit declined slightly for the quarter, we do expect growth for the full year.", "Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I'd like to thank all of you that attended our recent China conference in Shanghai and saw the leadership and tremendous operations teams we have in China. I'd like to thank Sam Su and our China team for hosting our guests at this great event.", "I'm obviously very proud of our China team's continued strong performance. Units expanded 12% and same-store sales grew 6% for the quarter. Our China division's operating profit has grown 29% year to date, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. ", "New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We've opened 245 new units through our first three quarters, and expect to open about 475 this year. Our China new unit returns remain a key focus for us, and continue to be the best in our business.", "Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let's start with KFC. With over 3,000 restaurants, KFC is the largest restaurant QSR concept in mainland China. While we're certainly viewed as the chicken experts, our menu also includes beef and seafood, as well as other products with broad appeal to Chinese consumers. ", "We are working on three key initiatives that will grow the business, leverage our assets, and build strong unit economics well into the future. First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. Our breakfast day part has seen double-digit sales growth this year, and now makes up about 10% of transactions. This sales layer is positioned well, as more Chinese consumers are eating breakfast outside their homes. ", "Next is delivery, which is now available in over 1400 units. The fast-growing delivery segment is primarily in higher-tier cities. Lastly, our 24-hour operations initiative is generating incremental sales and is now in about a third of our restaurants. These three big initiatives are leveraging our assets even more effectively and keeping our unit economics strong. ", "Pizza casual dining goes beyond pizza and continues to be the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with nearly 500 units in over 120 cities. Our new menu strategy continues to drive double-digit same-store growth. The menu is revamped twice a year and continues to offer a broad variety of entrees including beef, chicken, and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages, and desserts. We are having solid success building a true casual dining concept with everyday, affordable value. ", "We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut home service in the home delivery category, now has over 100 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to make progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the hot pot category, which is the largest casual-dining category in China.", "In summary, our China business is having a fantastic year. I couldn't be happier with the progress we're making in executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category. ", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International produced solid results in the quarter, with system sales growth of 5% and operating profit growth of 16%, prior to foreign currency translation benefits. Same-store sales increased 1% and restaurant margin improved 1.6 points. We continue to expect to have stronger sales performance in the fourth quarter. ", "We have opened 478 new restaurants this year, with our strong network of growth-oriented franchisees opening about 90% of these units. In fact, over 85% of the 14,000 traditional restaurants in this division are franchise units, which generate a steady, growing stream of franchise royalties. We expect to add about 900 new units for the full year, most of which are in emerging markets with growing middle class populations.", "It's the new unit development in these markets that sets Yum! apart and is positioning YRI for many successful years into the future. Rick will take you through more details on our emerging markets opportunity during his remarks.", "Yum! Restaurants International's new growth markets, France, India, and Russia, delivered 21% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation this quarter. We're very excited about the opportunities in these countries and look at these businesses as a future growth engine for Yum! Restaurants International. ", "Taco Bell International continues to expand. Our first Taco Bell in India opened this year, and there are currently two more scheduled to open in the fourth quarter. I look forward to my trip to both India and China in the next couple of weeks. ", "We opened our first Taco Bell in the U.K. in June, and another is scheduled to open in November. Overall, we've opened Taco Bells in seven new countries over the past two years, and expect to enter three additional countries by the end of the year. We're in very early stages, but could not be more delighted with how consumers are responding to the taste and value of our products. ", "KFC, our largest concept in Yum! Restaurants International, is currently focused on value and asset utilization. Value menus are in place in all our key markets, and we'll be expanding further this year. Our Krushers line of frozen beverages continues to expand, and we remain in the early stages of testing our KFC breakfast initiative, which we call KFC a.m. Clearly, McDonald's has had great success in developing these day parts, and we intend to do the same.", "Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. Importantly, we have a leading position and substantial runway for growth in emerging markets. Our strategy remains to drive an aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere. ", "Next, on to our U.S. business, where our focus is to improve our brands' positions, consistency, and returns. Combined, our U.S. brands grew same-store sales 1% in the quarter. Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S., grew same-store sales 3%. Taco Bell continues to leverage its position as one of the industry's value leaders in a market clearly focused on everyday value. ", "We also continued to make progress testing breakfast, home meal replacement options, and a new beverage platform. All these initiatives are designed to leverage our assets and build sustaining sales layers that enable accelerated growth. The Taco Bell team just had their annual franchise convention in Orlando, and our franchisees are pumped up about the future.", "Pizza Hut U.S. led the way again, with 8% same-store sales growth for the quarter, driven by the huge success of our $10 any pizza promotion. We recently changed our menu pricing that reduced the price of medium and large pizzas to $8 and $10 respectively for up to three toppings. Our specialty meat pizzas like Meat Lovers or Supreme, cost $2 more. This simplified menu strategy provides consistent value to consumers and is expected to further increase our margins.", "The best news for Pizza Hut is we now have everyday value and simplified pricing. We believe it is sustainable and a long-term strategy. We also continue to lead in innovation, with pizzas like the Big Italy. The combination of everyday value and new product innovation should position Pizza Hut for continued success, along with the arsenal we now have in pasta, with Tuscany Pastas, and wings, which we feature on Tuesday and Wednesday to leverage our asset.", "Now, on to KFC in the U.S. As expected, same-store sales continued to be soft, and declined 8% for the quarter, driven in part by reduced media spending. As we expect media comparisons to improve in the fourth quarter, we also expect better sales.", "Our focus remains on the following key areas: improved operations, value, balanced options featuring grilled products, portable product innovation, and asset upgrades. As you would expect, each of these major initiatives will take time to implement. There is no quick fix. We are absolutely committed to turning KFC around and we're seeing slow, but steady, progress. Overall, while our U.S. business profits are flat year to date, we do expect profit growth for the full year. ", "Let me wrap up the total Yum! story. Overall, we're having a great year and that gives us even more confidence in the power of our business model. This model relies on new unit development to drive about half of our EPS growth target of at least 10% annually. In 2011, we're well-positioned to hit our operating profit growth targets of 15% in China, 10% at YRI, and 5% from our U.S. business.", "The balance of our annual EPS growth comes from our base business through same-store sales, productivity initiatives, G&A leverage, and financial strategies. We have a track record that proves how powerful this growth model is. With the expected opening of 1400 international new units this year, and our strategies in the base business, we're in a good position for next year, and expect to make 2011 our 10th consecutive year we meet or exceed our target of at least 10% EPS growth.", "Now let me hand it over to Rick Carucci, our chief financial officer, and a great partner of mine.", "Rick Carucci", "Thank you David, and good morning everyone. In this section of our call I'm going to comment on four areas. I'll start with our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2010. Given the time of year, I will also cover some early thoughts on 2011, and finally I'll provide another chapter of information related to Yum's unique growth opportunity in emerging markets.", "In the third quarter, Yum's diverse global portfolio generated operating profit growth of 14% prior to foreign currency and special items. This was led by 23% growth in China and 16% growth in Yum! Restaurants International, while U.S. operating profit decreased by 2%. ", "As CFO, you're always happy to report double-digit operating profit growth. I'm particularly pleased that we are seeing this operating profit growth on top of 19% growth in the third quarter of last year. This is a very strong result, in what I would best characterize as a \"gray hair\" environment for CFOs over the past two years.", "In the third quarter we grew EPS 5%, excluding special items. The strong operating profit results were partially offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. Our tax rate prior to special items was 27.4% compared to an unusually low 19.9% rate in the third quarter last year. ", "There were also two newsworthy financial events for Yum! this quarter. In September, our board of directors announced a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend. Our quarterly cash payout will increase from $0.21 a share to $0.25 a share.", "Since its inception in 2004, we have increased the dividend each year and Yum's dividend per share is now five times higher than the 2004 level. In addition, over the past five years, our shareholder payout of dividends plus share repurchases puts us in the top 10% of S&P 500 companies.", "In the past, we've also talked about improving our balance sheet and smoothing our debt skyline. In August, we issued a ten-year, $350 million note. We plan to use those proceeds to pay down debt coming due in 2011. Our 3 7/8 coupon was the lowest rate we've ever attained. It was also the lowest ten year bond rate on record for any BBB minus rated corporate. It is great to see the recognition of our financial strength by fixed income investors. ", "Overall, we are quite pleased with the operational performance of our business, our financial strength, and our ability to drive shareholder value in the third quarter.", "We have now delivered three strong quarters in 2010, and thanks to robust profits from China and based on the strong year-to-date performance, we raised our full-year EPS target growth to 14%, excluding special items. ", "Let's try to put the balance of the year in perspective by business segment. First, in China we continued to benefit from the improvement of the Chinese consumer, where consumer confidence has now been positive year-over-year in the last nine months. This has helped generate year-to-date same-store sales results of 5% and we anticipate a similar sales performance for the fourth quarter.", "As we said before, we expect the cost environment to get more challenging in the fourth quarter. We expect about $15 million in labor inflation in the quarter, bringing the full-year level to $40 million. ", "On the commodities side, we've benefitted from year-to-date deflation of $35 million but we expect commodity inflation of about $15 million in the fourth quarter. While we don't expect pricing to have a significant impact on our 2010 results, we are confident that going forward, the strength of our brands will allow pricing to offset commodity and labor inflation. ", "What this all means is that our fourth-quarter margins may be about even, or go down slightly versus prior year. For the full year of 2010, we expect very strong absolute margins and an increase over the strong numbers posted last year.", "We are confident in our ability to continue our rapid new unit development in China and expect to reach our 2010 target of about 475 units. At the end of the third quarter, we've opened 245 restaurants, so our development pipeline is back-end loaded. Over the last three years, we've averaged over 200 units in the fourth quarter.", "When you add it up, this has been a particularly strong year for China. We expect to exceed our targets for the year, and now expect system sales growth of at least 15% and profit growth of at least 20%. ", "Yum! Restaurants International sales remained a bit sluggish in the third quarter, but sales comparisons continue to improve. Adjusting for the impact of the Chinese New Year, YRI same-store sales were down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2, and plus 1% in Q3. We expect same-store sales growth to continue to improve in the fourth quarter, as we overlap a 2% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2009. ", "Along with our franchise partners at YRI, we have developed 478 new units year to date and expect to build about 900 units for the full year. We have opened roughly 400 new units in the fourth quarter each of the last two years.", "In the U.S., we see the same pattern of same-store sales. Same-store sales in the U.S. were also down 1% in Q1, flat in Q2, and plus 1% in Q3. We also expect further improvement in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, especially when you consider the 8% same-store sales decline in the fourth quarter last year.", "As David mentioned, while our U.S. business profits are flat year to date, we do expect profit growth for the full year.", "Now let me give you an update on our refranchising. Our refranchising in the U.S. will likely fall short of our 500 unit target for the year. Unfortunately, a potential transaction recently fell through that would have put us in position to meet this target. ", "Keep in mind that we just started actively marketing most KFCs in the first quarter of this year. Remember, our overriding objective is to get the stores in the hands of the best operators. We do expect to nearly complete the refranchising of the Pizza Hut units by the end of this year, and we plan to complete our total U.S. refranchising program during 2011. ", "On the YRI front, we expect to close a refranchising transaction of our Mexico business in the fourth quarter. In Mexico we are refranchising 224 KFCs and 123 Pizza Hut company-owned restaurants, and the buyer will also become the master franchisor of our 155-unit Mexican franchise business. The good news is that the buyer is already a Yum! franchisee in Central America and is currently one of the very best franchisees in the world. ", "We anticipate a pre-tax refranchising loss of approximately $50 million that will be recorded in special items in the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "As a reminder, we also refranchised Taiwan at the beginning of this year. Therefore, while we continue to make equity investments in growth countries like India, Russia, and France, we will also refranchise businesses that do not meet our financial and strategic ownership criteria and are better operated by franchise partners.", "Overall, we are happy to raise our EPS growth forecast to 14%, excluding special items, and are very proud of the fact that 2010 will mark the ninth consecutive year we have delivered on our annual target of at least 10% growth.", "Now let's look ahead to 2011. We wanted to provide you an early view of some of the key items we see in 2011. As always, we will provide a more detailed outlook at the investor update in December. ", "First and foremost, I have confidence in our growth model. We expect 2011 to become the 10th straight year we achieve our target of at least 10% EPS growth. Similar to 2010, we expect over 80% of our profits to come from China, YRI, and U.S. Taco Bell. ", "As David mentioned, we are very fortunate that a key foundation of Yum's growth is new-unit development in China and YRI. The development of about 1,400 new units outside the U.S. gives us a head start on providing profit growth in 2011. In addition, our development pipeline looks similar next year.", "Now I'd like to briefly review some headwinds and tailwinds we believe we may face in 2011. First the headwinds. Based on what we are seeing today we expect some commodity inflation in 2011. In addition, with the growing number of speculators in this market, volatility is high right now. ", "As an example, we have seen spot corn prices in the U.S. go from $4.20 a bushel, up to $5.22 a bushel, and then down to $4.71 a bushel in just the last two months.", "Our China business has had a very strong year of profits in 2010. In addition to having an exceptionally strong year in margins to overlap, the 2010 results also will include a one-time benefit of about $15 million from our participation in the World Expo in Shanghai.", "Fortunately, we also expect a few tailwinds. We expect interest expense to be lower next year. That's on top of the reduction of at least $10 million in 2010. We also anticipate that we will see some benefit from currency translation in our China business. Please also note that our 2011 reporting calendar will include a 53rd week. ", "We will provide estimates of the magnitudes of these headwinds and tailwinds at our December meeting. We certainly expect 2011 to be another very strong year for Yum! ", "Now let's talk about emerging markets. As we've said on previous calls, Yum! has a unique growth opportunity and particular strength in emerging markets. We previously have outlined that we are currently the largest and fastest growing restaurant player in this arena. ", "We have also talked about the profit significance of this opportunity for Yum! and how we expect to generate about 60% of our profits from emerging markets in 2015. Last quarter, we provided Vietnam, Bangladesh, and Nigeria as examples of countries with high populations, where KFC has been a pioneer. Even as market leaders in those countries, we have a total of only about 100 restaurants, representing only 0.3 restaurants per million people. ", "Today, we'll provide a contrast by highlighting a few emerging markets where we have a longer history and are reaching significantly higher penetrations. We have been developing KFC and Pizza Hut in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia for decades. These emerging markets are growing over 7% a year. ", "In Indonesia there is a booming population of about 230 million people. We currently have 373 KFCs, 201 Pizza Huts, and 190 A&W restaurants. This has been a high growth business for us, as we have added 267 net units since the end of 2004. ", "In the Philippines, we have 200 KFCs and 150 Pizza Huts. We have added 92 net units over the past five years. With a population of over 90 million, this translates to about four restaurants to a million people. ", "Finally, our most substantial penetrations of these countries is in Malaysia. We have 475 KFCs and 217 Pizza Huts in Malaysia. We have achieved an estimated KFC market share of 45% of the branded fast food market and a Pizza Hut market share of 25% of the chain full-service market. With a population of almost 30 million, this represents 25 restaurants per million people, so clearly much higher penetrated. We have added 253 net units since the end of 2004.", "When you look at Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia, you see examples of leadership in emerging markets. We have simply excellent franchisees in all three countries. Together with our YRI Asia team, they are doing a great job of developing our brands.", "These countries demonstrate the power that emerging markets can have on our growth. In the past five years, these three countries alone have added a combined 712 net units. Just by themselves, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia have added about one point per year to YRI's new-unit growth rate.", "These countries also provide examples of what could be achieved in less-developed markets. Together, these three countries are home to about 350 million people and Yum! now has about five restaurants per million people. If India, for example, were to achieve this penetration rate, it would represent a 6,000-unit opportunity for Yum!", "Finally, while we have achieved a lot of growth in these countries, we are just as excited about our growth prospects in the years ahead. In summary, we are very comfortable with where we stand financially. We have three quarters of significant operating profit under our belt. We are pleased that we raised our 2010 guidance to 14% EPS growth excluding special items. ", "At the same time, we are focused on building a foundation for future growth through development in emerging markets. Our goal is to build a business that will drive performance for our shareholders for many years to come.", "Thank you, and back to you David.", "David Novak", "Okay, great. Let's take any questions that you guys have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe of JP Morgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan", "Two, I think, somewhat related questions. First, on the major YRI refranchising of Mexico and putting also that in the context of Taiwan, does that free you up organizationally to significantly increase unit development in high-return or high-potential markets that you have elsewhere in the world from a company perspective? And then secondly, could you discuss, if any, any constraints to increasing China unit growth in the out years as well?", "David Novak", "Why don't I start, John? First of all, I don't think it really impacts our growth in the rest of the world. We have teams focused on growth whether they're in company restaurants or franchise businesses. So we have franchise business units that are focused on helping our franchisees develop and we had a separate team in Taiwan that was running that market. So that was more of a strategic and financial decision and we remained focus on growth everywhere. ", "China, as I've said before, our growth there is really tied to continued growth of the economy. We have the teams in place. We don't feel there's any limitation based on either our development team or our operations capability. ", "And as the country grows, we expect it to continue in the areas that have helped us in the past, which is people moving from the country into the cities; greater infrastructure, which not only helps our distribution, but also gives us new trade zones in places like railroads, airports, etc.; and continued development in the central and west part of the country. ", "Because we have a national presence we feel we're able to take advantage of economic growth pretty much throughout the country. So it's really just tied to continued economic growth in China.", "John Ivankoe", "It would seem like some signals are pointing to the fact that China could certainly bear more new units in 2011 than it could have in 2009 or even 2010. Would that be fair to say?", "Rick Carucci", "We at this point, we're expecting a similar number of restaurants next year than this year. We may have a bit more, because Pizza Hut casual dining is starting to spread to more cities. So that's probably our biggest opportunity if I sort of look now at '11 versus '10. But over time, as economic growth in China continues, I still think there'll be a lot more people moving from the country into the city, and my personal guess is that the absolute number will go up over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian of Citi.", "Greg Badishkanian - Citi", "Hey guys, you did a really nice job on the pizza brand here in the U.S. Who do you think you're taking share from and would you expect that momentum to continue into the end of the next year or even into early next year?", "David Novak", "We're taking share primarily from regionals and the local mom and pops. I think that we're very optimistic about Pizza Hut's future because we've made some big long term moves that we believe are sustainable - everyday value, which solved our biggest issue, which was price, especially in this tough environment, and also the expansion and marketing of both our pasta and wings business on Tuesday and Wednesday to leverage the assets. So we're optimistic about the future of Pizza Hut.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Barash of Jeffries.", "Andrew Barash - Jeffries", "Just some clarification on the $15 million of commodity and labor inflation. Was that specific just to the China business, or is that global?", "Tim Jerzyk", "The $15 million in commodities was specific to China for Q4. So that set of numbers was China for Q4.", "Andrew Barash", "", "Okay. Do you have a global estimate for those two categories?", "Tim Jerzyk", "We don't. The U.S. is going to experience very minor inflation and YRI same thing - pretty much flat.", "Rick Carucci", "We probably expect a little bit of inflation in the U.S. as Tim said, primarily driven by beef in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Just a question on the China business and your inflation outlook perhaps beyond Q4. It looks like maybe 2011 could have some inflationary pressures. Just wondering if you could talk about your philosophy related to taking pricing actions and perhaps sort of the long-term view on the margin structure there if there's opportunity to increase margins or are you satisfied where they are today?", "Rick Carucci", "We obviously have huge margins this year that may be a couple points higher than what you could expect on an ongoing basis. But on an ongoing basis I still expect 20+ margins in China for the foreseeable future. ", "Over time we've always had labor inflation and again, labor inflation now has grown to about 13% or so of our cost structure in China, so 13% of sales. If you have a healthy increase on that number, that's still - let's put it at 10% - that would require about 1.3% pricing. ", "So we clearly think our brands have the ability to absorb that and any other increases you could or couldn't get in commodities. I personally think commodities are likely to fluctuate year to year as opposed to inflation, where our model has built in pretty steady increases over time. ", "The labor thing to me is sort of a dual-edged sword. It clearly - we have to price or get cost efficiencies to cover it, but at the same time we like the fact that people have more money in their pockets and we have more consumers who could buy our products.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner of Credit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just a question on YRI. I was a little bit surprised and very pleased, actually, with the margins, and I was wondering if you could talk about how you achieved that leverage with a 1% one-year and two-year comp. Maybe some more details around this? Was this refranchising? What else contributed to that leverage on that margin with a 1% comp?", "David Novak", "The two biggest leverages this quarter were first, on the margins - you hit it right, it was refranchising. So that had a significant impact on the margins this quarter. In terms of the other P&L leverage we got, we did have G&A leverage, and this quarter was a bit higher than most because we were overlapping a convention we had in the third quarter last year. But generally on an ongoing basis we usually expect to see around 6% type of system sales growth and then modest leverage in the rest of the cost structure to get to our 10% target.", "Keith Siegner", "And then one followup question. With this Mexico refranchising it's quite a few units. How do you anticipate this impacting, let's say, company restaurant margins for YRI going forward?", "David Novak", "It will improve the numbers. We'll give you more input on that at the December meeting but we think it will improve the margins and actually slightly help our profitability in 2011.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley of Bank of America.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Couple questions on China as well. The labor costs were up as you mentioned. Could you talk about the wage rate inflation you experienced through your system? And then could you talk about how sales fared in markets where wage rate inflation was higher rather than lower? Did you in fact see that sales lift from wage levels going up overall throughout the country?", "David Novak", "I have not looked at the second part of your question, Joe. So I haven't looked at the comparison between where rates are a little higher and sales growth. Because generally speaking the percentage increases over time have been fairly similar, but it's something we'll probably take a look at.", "Typically we usually see about 8% to 10% type of labor inflation. For this quarter and next quarter it was a bit higher than that. We'll probably see that again in the first half of next year. As we said it had the unusually high increase - sort of the mid-point this year.", "Joe Buckley", "And just one more. I think you mentioned $15 million in full-year benefits from the World Expo. So I guess there's another $5 million coming in the fourth quarter. Talk about how that comes in. Is there a revenue number associated with that $15 million of operating profits? Just to help us understand the margins a little bit better.", "Tim Jerzyk", "The benefit is basically just as if it's a company-owned store, and it actually is. So you see it in company sales and then company restaurant operating costs. So it's a benefit to restaurant margins, it's a benefit to profit. It's excluded from the 14 restaurants in the Expo, or were excluded from the unit count, because they're only temporary. And the same-store sales number that we gave you excludes the sales benefit.", "Joe Buckley", "And the operating profit margin on those 14 restaurants, would it be comparable to what you reported?", "Rick Carucci", "Probably higher.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Two questions. Just first, a follow up on China. I think you mentioned for the fourth quarter you would expect comps to kind of run similar to what you were running year to date, which I think was 5%. I know the [compares ease] a few hundred basis points. I didn't know if there were any unusuals. It seems like consumer confidence continues to improve. I would think you'd expect that comp trend to continue to improve from the 6% we saw here. ", "And then when you look out to 2011 is it reasonable to assume further comp recovery, or do you think the recovery stage is over and now perhaps it's more appropriate to assume more low single-digit comps as your penetration grows and you push more in the direction of maturity? And then I had a follow up question on cash.", "Rick Carucci", "First of all, regarding long term comps, we haven't looked into 2011 in a lot of detail yet. But typically speaking our model looks in the 3% to 5% range of same-store sales to make our model work. So that's sort of a typical type of number and obviously depending on the cost structure and the inflation environment. We've sort of covered this on some of the previous calls, looking at two-year, three-year, one-year comps, and looking at when the inflection points were with the earthquake and the softening of the economy at the end of 2009. We think the year to date number is as good a number as anything for the fourth quarter. One of the challenges on the consumer confidence side is even though it's better than a year ago it's sort of flattened out in terms of the improvement rate. So we're seeing year-over-year improvement but we're not seeing accelerated improvement in consumer confidence. So we're, with you, trying to read the tea leaves. So we just see it's a better economy, not yet booming.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Gotcha. And then just separately, Rick, on the cash usage side, I know the cash position continues to increase pretty meaningfully at more than double relative to last quarter. I know back then part of it was just due to repatriation timing. But it doesn't seem like there's a major debt due. I know there's $600 million in debt due in '11, for which you did this debt offering, but should we expect share buyback to increase meaningfully for the rest of this year and into '11? Just wondering how you determine the timing and perhaps the ultimate amount of repurchase with only it looks like $30 million in the third quarter, less than $300 million year to date. Just trying to size up the timing and how you determine the amount to repurchase. Thanks.", "Rick Carucci", "We expect that we'll probably have more share repurchases in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, and then we expect more share repurchases right now in 2011 than 2010. But we don't have real specific numbers. Again, we'll try to share some of that with you in December.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Back to the China comps for a moment. Do you have any better clarity or visibility on what you think the benefits of the 24 hours and the breakfast had on comps this quarter? And what are the updated thoughts on pricing strategy? Are you going to take pricing late this year, and it's going to impact next year? Or are you going to wait until next year to talk about pricing, or do pricing in China?", "Rick Carucci", "We think the benefits of some of the ops initiatives that we talked about - 24 hour, delivery, etc. - probably in the 1% to 2% range. I probably expect a similar kind of number next year, a little early to tell. Regarding pricing, don't expect much impact at all. As I said in my remarks, in the fourth quarter we'll probably have some modest pricing increase either late this year or early next year. Beyond that we'll have to wait and see what our inflation expectations are.", "John Glass", "And then as it relates to the refranchising strategy at YRI, what is it? At this point I think this transaction is roughly 20% of your company units, which is material. Do you expect there to be other large transactions like this in the next 18 to 24 months in other more mature YRI markets? Or was this really just a one-off and we shouldn't expect to see a real change in the percentage ownership from YRI going forward?", "David Novak", "What happens at YRI as you know, John, we are at the same time building units in developing markets, so places like India and also for us underdeveloped markets like France are also company. So we'll be adding on that side at the same time with the selective refranchising. We'll do some more selective refranchising, probably not the size - you shouldn't expect next year to see something of the size of Mexico though.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Rothman of Susquehanna.", "Rachel Rothman - Susquehanna", "I don't know if I missed this, but can you talk about maybe traffic trends in each of your key three regions? I think someone asked about pricing power, but just backward looking, how has traffic been diverging or following along with same-store sales?", "David Novak", "In China most of the increase has been transactions. So almost all of it. We have had very small levels of pricing this year. So it's pretty much all transaction-driven. Generally speaking if you looked at the U.S. you'd probably get a couple of points of pricing. So if you looked at our same-store sales numbers and took off a couple of points for Taco Bell and KFC you'd probably get close. Pizza Hut is a different story because there we've actually had a net pricing decline, so our transactions are significantly above our growth rate.", "Rachel Rothman", "", "And then YRI, has it been price or traffic?", "Tim Jerzyk", "YRI has mostly been traffic.", "Rachel Rothman", "", "And then if I could just follow up on China, could you talk about maybe same-store sales growth trends in the newer markets versus the developed markets?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Actually, the same-store sales growth this year has been very balanced across all tiers and all geographies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Not surprisingly, another question on China and then a separate one actually that's a little bigger picture. On China, you said you've taken very little price, but it was noticed that the inflation data out of China are positive and have gotten a little bit more positive. So I guess I'm trying to think about let's call it cross-price elasticity. So what some of your competitors might be doing, or what food at home might be doing? And does that give you a little bit more leeway in terms of if you don't take price you gain some of the traffic? Just trying to think about how your pricing compares in China to substitutes like either away from or at home. That's the first question.", "David Novak", "We had some, I'd say, unusual commodities in China over the last two years. I'm not sure if we would have mirrored the at home market. Chicken obviously did go up a lot - [the 1 point late '08]. So other commodities have grown at different rates. We don't have a lot of great information, at least I haven't seen, on cross-elasticity between the take homes and take away market in China. Clearly there it is going to be more sensitive on the economy because people there generally have lower incomes so usually when something's a higher percentage of your ticket you're going to have more impact in the restaurant business when the economy is weaker than you probably would in the grocery side. That would be my guess, but I don't have data that would back that up.", "Sara Senatore", "Okay, thank you. And then the broader-picture question, you talked a lot about emerging markets, and how you're the fastest grower there, the biggest presence. Can you just talk broadly about why that is in so far as you're certainly bigger than a lot of restaurant companies with whom you might compete, but there are other scaled restaurant companies. So is there something about your supply chain? Do you own more of your supply chain? Is it something about how you run your business? If you could just maybe talk about some of the advantages that sustain that faster pace?", "David Novak", "I think, you know, KFC is our biggest brand [outside the United States]. KFC has the big advantage of being a very popular protein, where we've brought tremendous unique image to a known quantity and we've been able to grow. We were blessed to have a number of very aggressive and top flight franchisees who've invested in the markets for years before other competition every even entered, and still is yet to enter. For example, in Vietnam. McDonald's isn't even in Vietnam. So I think that it's the protein of choice with the unique brand, combined with tremendous franchisees who have invested in the supply chain.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser of Buckingham Research.", "Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research", "My question's on food costs and of course we all know you're very much a franchised organization, but still these store level margins do have an impact on earnings per share. Just to try to get a sense with corn up now about 40% year-over-year, and maybe just looking at the U.S. business in particular, how does that flow through to your P&L if costs are at this rate today? Does it take three or six months for that to be felt through the P&L? Just trying to get a sense of the sensitivity to that and the timing as well.", "Rick Carucci", "You sort of have two pieces. There's some things that you know will go up a bit, so we'll sign some contracts on certain items soon for 2011, but part of the impact this year, Mitch, is that you're probably going to be less further out in hedging given the volatility. Because it gets more expensive to hedge in that kind of a situation. Plus, with speculators - and a lot of people don't want to hedge when speculators are in because the feeling is when they go out the prices will go back down. So probably just the reality is we probably have a little bit more uncertainty than usual, and right now if you looked at the numbers we'd probably expect in an area of about a 3% increase in the U.S. But a lot could happen between now and the start of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney of Hedgeye Risk Management.", "Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management", "I guess it's not unprecedented for dominant brands to lower prices to drive traffic, and I think again, you've obviously done it and different consumer categories have done it, and you've struggled with KFC for a number of years, tried a number of different new products. Is lowering prices not the right strategy? It's been successful for Pizza Hut recently. Why isn't just bringing the price points down for KFC the right strategy to get people back in the door?", "David Novak", "Howard, I actually think you have a pretty good comment there that I think the brand is very well aware of. Our value ratings are not as high as they should be in the category. KFC, because it's primarily a chicken on the bone dinner business, has pricing that's closer to casual dining than it does typical fast food. We have a number of things in test right now to enhance and improve our value, and the test marketing results where we've gone aggressive enough are definitely moving in the right direction. So we don't have anything to really announce on that but that's clearly an area of opportunity for us that you've identified, we've identified, the consumer's told us is an opportunity, and we're working hard on it.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "David Novak", "Well let me just wrap things up. We had a solid quarter, and have had a great year so far. We're pleased with the performance of our business units, specifically our strong performance in China. We're confident in delivering our raised target of 14% EPS growth. We continue to execute against our global growth opportunity, especially in emerging markets. There's no doubt we are well-positioned in the fastest growing economies of the world with rapidly expanding middle class populations. We're making progress in our U.S business. We're confident in delivering 14% EPS growth, making 2010 our ninth consecutive year we meet or exceed our target of at least 10%, and we're very confident about our continuing track record for 2011. Our significant and growing exposure to the explosive growth in China, the rest of Asia, and emerging markets, gives us an unprecedented short and long term opportunity.", "We look forward to sharing more on this in December, and seeing you at our annual investor conference.

I am especially pleased to announce that 2010 was one of our best years as a company. We reported 17% full year EPS growth, excluding special items marking the ninth straight year that we exceeded our annual target of at least 10%. In fact, 17% EPS growth is our best ever and what makes us even more impressive is that it was driven by a 15% increase in operating profit including gains across all three of our business divisions. ", "As I look back on the past year, I\u2019m really proud of what we accomplished. We opened nearly 1,400 new restaurants outside the US while making steady progress building incremental day parts and sales layers in each of our business. ", "We improved worldwide restaurant margins by 1.3 percentage points. And I am pleased that over the past two years we\u2019ve increased worldwide restaurant margins by threefold percentage points. Operating profit grew 15% prior to foreign currency translation and special items. And importantly, we maintained our return on invested capital of 20% plus and remain an industry leader. ", "Our strong cash flow generation combined with our disciplined approach with deploying capital allowed us to increase our dividend 19% to an annual rate of $1 per share. ", "We are particularly pleased with our China business which reported robust profit growth of 26% for the full year excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. At Yum Restaurant International YRI, we grew operating profits 11% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation in spite of positive but sluggish system sales growth. Our US business also grew operating profits, reporting a 3% increase for the year. ", "Before I take you through our key strategies of results for each division, let me start by thanking all of you who attended our investor and also grew operating margins reporting a 3% increase for the year.", "Before I take you through our key strategies and results for each division, let me start by thanking all of you who attended our investor and annual day in past December in New York. I look forward to that meting every year because it set the tone for the coming year, more importantly its gives us the opportunity to go public with our goals and commitments as well as showcase our management talent from around the world. In case any of you miss this meeting, you can find the presentations on our website at yum.com.", "Now onto our strategies, let me start with our China business, where our strategy is to build leading brands in every significant category. We grew profits by a whopping 26% in 2010 prior to our foreign currency translation. I am proud to report that in the last three years, our China business profit has more than doubled and we expected to become our first billion dollar profit business in the very near future. Our recipe for success is continued profitable new unit development and leveraging our existence assets with new day parts and sales layers to grow same-store sales. ", "In 2010, we once again opened over 500 restaurants in China including 262 in the fourth quarter. That is obviously an extremely impressive accomplishment. (Inaudible) and his world class are clearly delivering dynasty like performance for each of our brands. ", "Our KFC business has been absolutely rock solid. We now over 3,200 KFCs in China and continue to see cash paybacks in less than three years on new restaurants. KFC had 414 new locations in 2010 and made good progress leveraging its assets with 24 hour operations, delivery service and continued building, a solid breakfast business. Our growth in results were driven by increased traffic. We continue to be confident in the strength of the KFC brand in China. ", "Now on to Pizza Hut, Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China had a breakout year generating double-digit same-store sales growth in every quarter of 2010. We have more than 500 restaurants in over a 130 cities and we added 60 new locations in 2010. Additionally, operating profit grew 50% and Pizza Hut Casual Dining now generates well over $100 million in operating profit. Our strategy to revamp the menu every six months and continue to offer compelling value is truly paying dividends. Given our dramatic sales growth, the unit economics of the Pizza Hut Casual Dining concept in China are even more scalable setting us up for significant growth ahead. ", "We also continue to invest to behind development of our merging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service now has 120 units in 11 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast-food brand continued to make progress as we drive for scalable economics. Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the hot pot category, which is the largest casual dining category in China. ", "In summary, anyway if you look at it, our China business had a stellar year. More importantly, I couldn\u2019t be more bullish about our future growth opportunities. We know we have established category leading brands and we have a world class management team driving the business forward. We continue to believe we are in the early innings and on the ground floor of growth in China. ", "Next, Yum Restaurant International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive international expansion and build stronger brands everywhere. YRI delivered 11% full year operating profit growth and ended the year strong with 18% growth in the fourth quarter both prior to foreign currency translation. Driven by franchisee development, we opened 884 new units in over 75 countries including 548 in emerging markets. YRI now has 6,350 restaurants in emerging markets across 67 countries, a level that is unmatched by any competitor. This impressive unit growth is the most obvious sign of the health of our brands internationally. ", "Importantly, we made major progress creating new growth vehicles by investing in India, Russia and Africa as well as beginning to develop Taco Bell into a totally, truly global brand. 2010 was a milestone year for India, particularly with the KFC brand. We suppressed 100 units, had terrific sales growth and now have very good unit economics. This gives us the infrastructure and scales to fuel aggressive growth going forward.", "In Russia we made an acquisition that gave us full management control of the KFC Rostik brand, giving us a 150 restaurants in total. Now, I have to tell you, we are very excited to have over 100 KFCs in both Russia and India. Remember, it took us 10 years to get to a 100 units in China.", "In Africa we already have a dominant market position in South Africa with over 600 KFCs. As we shared in our New York meeting, we\u2019re now expanding throughout the continent. Our franchise partners are building restaurants in Nigeria and Ghana as well as East Africa and we\u2019re extremely happy with how well customers have taken to the KFC brand and how enthused our franchisees are about the opportunity ahead.", "We are also making progress developing Taco Bell. We have entered ten new countries in the past two years. We are building more and more confidence Taco Bell can become a truly global brand. YRI also made progress leveraging our existing assets and building incremental day parts and sales layers, we aggressively expanded our Crushers line of frozen beverages at KFC and we\u2019re going hard expanding non-fried throughout the world. We continue to make progress testing breakfast. ", "It\u2019s going to take, it\u2019s time to get these day parts and sales layers established, but this will ultimately give us the ability to drive our unit lines higher and ultimately our average unit economics as well. There is no reason why we can\u2019t be a multi-day part, multi-protein concept outside the United States, where our only major competitor is McDonald\u2019s, who has already shown us the way. That opportunity is ahead for us.", "We are also very focused on improving our operating model at Pizza Hut. Our biggest initiative to do this is what we call channel separation. We want our casual dining restaurants focused on dining customers and our delivery restaurants focused on delivery and carry out. We think having both under one roof, produces a high degree of complexity and we intend to be more streamline going forward. Now in spite of all our optimism at YRI, I want to point out that YRI sales in 2010 were sluggish, the team is addressing this with stronger be year-ago innovation and value.", "Finally, as we shift our resources to support high growth, high return businesses, we elected the refranchise our Taiwan and Mexico restaurants. These transactions as well as improvements in our company owned restaurants drove restaurant margins 80 basis points higher for the year.", "In the United States, our strategy is to dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. We grew same-store sales 1% for the year including 5% in the fourth quarter and increased restaurant margins for the year. We also made significant progress on the refranchising front as we sold over 400 restaurants to highly capable franchisees.", "Taco Bell finished the year on a high note with 4% same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter. Transactions grew each quarter of 2010 and were encouraged by the check momentum we saw in the second half of the year to complement our transaction growth. Like all QSR\u2019s in a top environment, sales were not as high as we would\u2019ve like and Taco Bell had to work very hard for these results. Taco Bell remains the category leader in value and as you know, we continue to provide healthy returns with high average unit volumes and strong margins.", "The system also continues to contemporize itself with increased remodel activity. We also made progress testing breakfast, a new beverage platform and home meal replacement. Short-term, we expect to see a return on investments with our new dinner Taco packs. Longer-term, we expect breakfast to become a growth engine. We are working on these initiatives because our goal is to leverage our asset.", "Now I want to address the recent loss we filed against Taco Bell. First, let me state that the claims made against Taco Bell seasoned beef are absolutely false. I\u2019ve heard the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers and press (inaudible) figures like 35% when the fact is Taco Bell seasoned beef recipe calls for 88% beef. Given these complaints we felt we had to defend strongly the brand and the quality of our seasoned beef. So we have used this opportunity to spread the world about our quality which is YR red, our advertising red thank you suing us. (Inaudible) did an excellent job setting the record straight and we\u2019re seriously reviewing our legal options against those who made false claims about our products.", "Now regardless how strong your brand is, there is no question, any incident regarding the quality of your food negatively impacts your image in sales. So clearly we are seeing a negative short-term impact. We believe we turned the tide with our aggressive response and we\u2019ll wait and see the ultimate impact. We of course also had the headwinds of the weather across the US for all our brands to deal with in the first quarter.", "Now, on the Pizza Hut. I\u2019m extremely proud of the Pizza team for completely repositioning and restructuring the business. Pizza went from the worst to first in value ratings in the category. This was done by launching the $10 any Pizza promotion and following that up with the system wide initiative to provide everyday affordable menu prices. Pizza grew same-store-sales 8% for the year and is clearly winning on providing everyday value. Our restructuring is virtually complete as over 90% of our system restaurants are owned by franchisees.", "At KFC, the business hasn\u2019t changed from the yet update I gave during our December analyst meeting. We have a big job ahead of us and it\u2019s going to take us time to execute our plans. As we move into 2011, we are going to focus the majority of our comments on the three growth drivers that make our company unique. Our leading brands in China, YRI\u2019s dominate position in emerging markets and Taco Bell\u2019s asset leverage in new unit opportunities. We believe with increased sales growth Taco Bell can go from its 5,000 units in the US to over 8,000.", "All of this initiative, all these growth opportunities will drive our franchise fees and generate tremendous cash flow, shareholder (inaudible) and shareholder value.", "So let me wrap this up. We had a great year in 2010 but we realized that 2010 is yesterday\u2019s newspaper. We are working hard to make sure 2011 is another successful year and make it our 10th consecutive year of meeting our annual target of at least 10% earnings per share growth.", "Now let me turn it over to Rick.", "Rick Carucci ", "Thank you David and good morning everyone. In this section of the call I\u2019m going to comment on two areas. First, I\u2019m going to give some context to our 2010 results and then I\u2019ll give a brief outlook for 2011. As David mentioned, Yum had a really strong year in 2010. What I want to do now still fact the annual overall and share with you how some of our key actions in 2010 change the position of our company going forward. The main topic I am going to cover is how we strengthened our competitive position in China, how we reinforced our lead in emerging markets and how the execution of our refranchising strategy has changed our financial model. Taken together, you\u2019ll see that we made progress during the year in revolving Yum\u2019s position as a high growth, high return company.", "In the earnings release in David\u2019s speech, you\u2019ve already read and heard about the pioneer we had in China in 2010. But beyond the numbers, the China team also strengthened our competitive advantage especially by furthering our presence throughout that country. At KFC, we opened 414 new restaurants in China including 203 in the fourth quarter. This compares to a 166 units opened during the year by McDonalds. Therefore KFC opened about 250 more units. Just as important from the competitor\u2019s standpoint is where we had these units. We entered 57 new cities, we are now in 713 different cities around China. In fact about half of the new units in 2010, we\u2019ve in Tier 3 through Tier 6 cities.", "KFC now more units in Tier 3 cities in smaller, that more the McDonald had in the whole county. As we pioneer in to new KFC cities and continue to develop existing Tier 3 to Tier 6 cities, we have been able to secure the best locations and hire great talents. This expansion also continues to be profitable. Please keep in mind that our combined margins in Tier 3 to Tier 6 cities are couple of percentage point higher than our national average. ", "We\u2019re also starting to make meaningful progress in developing Pizza Hut Casual Dining in some lower tier cities. We headed 22 units in restaurants in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities, finishing the year with a 137 restaurants in those cities. This is significant, because traditionally Casual Dining has been reserved only for Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities where incomes were higher. Based on the progress to Pizza, Pizza Hut made in 2010, we\u2019re hopeful that Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities can provide strong ongoing growth opportunities in the years ahead. ", "As David mentioned, Pizza Hut Casual Dining has brought itself way beyond Pizza including Beef, Pasta and Rice dishes along with appetizers, beverages and deserts. This broad appeal further insulates us from Casual Dining competition. Pizza casual dining is light years ahead of other Western casual dining concepts, in terms of units, people capability and the ability to grow nationally. ", "Moving behind China, let\u2019s look at other emerging countries. Through 2010, we highlighted our unique strength and growing presence in emerging markets. Places like Indonesia, Vietnam and Nigeria would open up our first KFC restaurant in 2010. We are so excited about our emerging markets because we have the largest presence and we are growing so rapidly, it is simply a huge opportunity. ", "I\u2019m not going rehash the information we covered in our emerging markets trend in the New York meeting. However, I will say that while each market is different, as a whole we believe we improved our position in 2010. We also reached a few key milestones. When we take the 507 units we added in China, combined with the 548 million, it\u2019s an emerging market at Yum Restaurants International. We both saw over 1000 new emerging market restaurants during 2010.", "In addition, during the fourth quarter of the year, Yum surpassed a 10,000 unit mark for emerging markets. While we have been aggressively pursuing growth in China and other emerging markets, we also believe it is important to be disciplined in determining where the own company restaurants.", "While we don\u2019t see the potential for high-growth or high returns, we often refranchise the units and hand them over to strong local operators. Refranchise being great stability to earnings, reduce capital investments and improves returns.", "During 2010, we substantially completed the ongoing refranchising of Pizza in the United States. Since we announced our US franchising initiative at the end of 2007, we sold over 1,600 units of franchisees. This refranchising has been a leading contributor to the one point increase in margins that have occurred in the US over the past three years.", "During 2010 YRI margins improved about 0.5% from the refranchising of the Taiwan business. We expect further improvements in 2011 to the refranchising of Mexico that was completed in the fourth quarter. When you combine this refranchising with the growth in India and other emerging markets, we believe that the YRI portfolio improved significantly during 2010.", "When you couple this significant refranchising with our heavy equity investment in China, our company owned portfolio has shifted dramatically in the last ten years. In 2000, 70% of our company owned units were in the US, while only 4% were in China. By the end of 2010 only 34% of our company owned units were in the US and 44% went China. This is a trade-off that we\u2019re happy to make as we continue to benefit from the high-growth and high return China business.", "This change has also increased our dependence on China. China is now the largest contributor of profits and has the most impact to Yum\u2019s overall growth. However, we are working hard to grow in other emerging and strategic markets. Our plans for businesses in India, Russia, France and Germany, we are also investing company capital to grow at a high rate.", "We believe that these markets combined with growth and other emerging markets and Taco Bell International, will eventually reduce our dependence on China. However, as you look at our portfolio shipped overtime and look into the future, we are very pleased with how our business model has evolved.", "As we continue strengthening our position in China, we are enforcing our lead in emerging markets and refranchising when appropriate. We continue to enhance future growth, provide strong returns and increase shareholder value. In order to sharpen our focus even further, we recently announced our intention to sell our entire Long John Silver and A&W Restaurant businesses. ", "Let\u2019s now look ahead to 2011. As a reminder in our ongoing battle, China, YRI and Taco Bell in the US account for about 85% of profits. In that model they are expected to generate operating profit growth rates of 15%, 10% and 6% respectively. This results in approximately 13% EPS growth.", "As we look into 2011, we see some headwinds and some tailwinds that could impact division in overall Yum performance. In terms of headwinds, commodity inflation will be a challenge across all divisions. We planned for 5% food and paper inflation in China, along with 4% in the US and 3% in YRI. Currently, many commodity costs remain at high levels and if there is non-improvement in the coming months, there could be cost pressures above these levels.", "In China we also expect high wage inflation with increases now expected to be in the mid-teens. There are also one-time items working against 2011 and 2012. A new business tax will have a negative impact of around $25 million. We\u2019ll also overlap the benefit we received in 2010 of our brand\u2019s participation in world expo which resulted in [$60] million of profit. These two onetime items have about 5% negative impact on China\u2019s 2011 profits.", "On the other side of the coin there\u2019ll be some beneficial tailwinds. International\u2019s new unit development remains a key driver of our growth. We expect to once again add 14,000 new units outside the US in 2011. The new units built in 2010 and 2011 just deliver about half of our EPS growth. Since the 2010 development was backend loaded, these units will have a larger impact than usual in 2011.", "We are forecasting a foreign exchange benefit including at least $20 million upside from the launch. We\u2019ll also see lower interest expense due to favorable data issuances over the past couple of years and as we retire the April 2011 bonds.", "Finally, the Mexico refranchising should have a positive impact operating profit of about $10 million. Our teams around the world will work hard at managing inflation combined with a recovering global economy. We\u2019ll need to be especially smart about how to provide great value to our consumers while also covering higher costs. Two examples of our approach have already taken place in 2011. At the start of the year at Taco Bell, we\u2019ve prominently featured a $0.99 why pay more item. Last year, we were featuring a $0.89 item. Second, we took a modest price increase in China just before the Chinese New Year. This increase will cover the majority but not all of our inflation expectations for the year. At the same time in China, we continued to provide value offerings.", "When you look at the whole picture and evaluate our headwinds and tailwinds, I am very confident that 2011 will be our 10th straight year of delivering at least 10% earnings per share growth. In addition, our strong balance sheet and powerful cash generation allows to return more than $1 billion shareholders in 2011 between our recently increased dividend and the $750 million of additional authorized share repurchases, we planned to put more cash in the hands of its rightful owner. ", "In summary, I am proud of this year\u2019s financial results and all that we have accomplished in 2010. We have record EPS growth, added shareholder value and continue to evolve our business model. I am equally excited about our future as we are well positioned to deliver result in 2011 and beyond. Back to you David. ", "David Novak", "Okay Rick. Thank you very much and it\u2019s time for us to take any questions that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert Baird. ", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Question on the China margin outlook, you\u2019ve mentioned that you took a price increase recently. Could you quantify the level of that price increase and, then talk about the outlook you have for margins relative to the pricing and terrific growth that you might be expecting for the year?", "David Novak", "Well, just to do dimensionalize the pricing, if we look at the expected inflation we talked about on cost-to-goods sold about 5% and look at mid-teen labor inflation, you need about 3.5 to 4% pricing to cover that inflation. In the round that we just, we covered about three quarters of that amount. In terms of margins for the quarter, just want to remind people versus last year, last year we had record margins of over 26% that were driven by commodity deflation, which we say, we are not sustainable. We only took the price increase in the middle of the quarter. As a reminder, Q1 in 2011 only includes two months, January and February, so we basically got only one month of that pricing benefits. So we expect margins to go down versus off at very high levels.", "David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Next Rick, maybe just a quick follow-up, is that a statement on Q1 or is that your outlook for the year and maybe if you could talk about for the year, what\u2019s needed in terms of traffic growth to hold on to margins given some of the unusual comparisons you have?", "David Novak", "Yes obviously, we know we are lapping very high margins in 2011. So I\u2019m not sure, we are not necessary expecting margins to go up in 2011, I think they could go down a little up as high 2010 level, so though we expect them to stay, about 20%. With the inflation piece, we typically say that we need about at least 4% same store sales growth to hit our profits targets. This year probably more than the inflation David, we\u2019re also lapping those onetime items, so that adds probably a couple of points, at least a couple of points, what we need to do to deliver our normal numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Jeff Omohundro with Wells Fargo.", "Jeff Omohundro \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Thanks. Another question on the China, you mentioned pricing as a mechanism to manage inflation. I wonder if you could talk about other initiatives to improve the efficiencies in the operating structure in that the market that might help you further offset inflation and then as a follow-up secondarily to that, how\u2019s your inflation environment impacting returns on new units? Thanks.", "David Novak", "Yes, in terms of we are always in China working of productivity initiatives, especially since we are on distribution system, so we always have a full cord press on that. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any one item that I could point to that\u2019s special, that we are doing anything special this year. That\u2019s something we just always have a huge amount of emphasis on given the size of our business there and like I said because we run the system. ", "In terms of new units, we are still extremely pleased with new unit turns; we don\u2019t see building any impact there. I think, I have to look at long term is, as I have said at the December meeting. I\u2019m still personally bullish on long-term margins in China and we already have less than three year paybacks, so I don\u2019t really see that change in them. One of the things was we talked about in this speech, is that we are doing very well, really throughout the country and our returns through all tier cities and we are also always put a lot of pressure on ourselves to build new sales layers on the KFC side. We were very pleased with the progress we made on things like 24 hour delivery, practice, 24 service delivery in breakfast. So we were very pleased with how those are developing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi guys. I just wanted to follow-up on China, again just broadly when you think about, if we\u2019re re-entering in an inflationary environment that could be, let\u2019s call it semi-permanent, how do you think about consumers increase purchasing power versus labor and food inflation and whether you think you might be less beneficiary or this might hurt you over time. And then secondly, but related, can you talk a little about the labor inflation, please because you\u2019re now compounding double-digit labor inflation year-over-year and it looks like structurally that seems to be a part of the China P&L but more and more challenge overtime in this quarter was the highest percentage of sales that we\u2019ve seen in that line item. (Inaudible). So, if you could help on those parts it would be great.", "Rick Carucci ", "Mike, let me start with the second part. Labor, we always have said that we expect labor to continue to go up in China. So, that\u2019s part of the business now has been for years and I think will continue for the years ahead. Now the China policy, to the first part of your question is to, they want increased wages to the broad population in the years ahead. It was especially high in the second half, especially the fourth quarter of 2010 because we had two increases. ", "So we had labor increases twice during 2010, which is going drive up as we sort of said earlier, the second half of \u201810 and at least three quarters of \u201811. And in addition, there were no really wage increases in 2009. So they more than made up for that, it looks like in 2010 and they look to do the same in 2011. Also, in the fourth quarter, we opened up, you saw those units we opened. So we obviously had training to support those new unit openings, so that further made the fourth quarter labor higher than usual. ", "As you go forward to the first part of your question which is obviously an important question. As I suggested in New York look I actually don\u2019t fear an ongoing inflation scenario. I think the strongest brands are always in the best position to manage that. You obviously have to work very smartly of how you manage value, pricing and menu mix management, but, to me, when you have strong brands and 24-hour platforms, you\u2019re probably in a better place than most people to do that. So, I feel comfortable operating in that environment even though it\u2019ll keep us on our toes.", "David Novak ", "The only thing I would add on that is, I remember going to China for the first time in 1997 standing, watching all the customers in there where you\u2019d see the parent standing in line with their kids, and they buy the chicken for their kids, and the family couldn\u2019t really eat. Now when I go to China you see the kids buying the food. And I think one of things that\u2019s happening is as wages go up and the economy continues to grow; the consumer base is just growing exponentially and someone like told me we\u2019d be in over 700 cities, Tier 4, Tier 5, Tier 6 cities 10 years ago. I am not sure I would have believed it, and the only reason is, is people have money there and they can spend it, and I don\u2019t see that going down in the future. I think that\u2019s going to go up and so, I think we\u2019re very well-positioned to take advantage of the opportunity, the dynamic growth that is going on in China, and we\u2019re going to have, just like we have had in the US and other parts of the world, we\u2019re going to have the headwinds, tailwinds, all that. But we are like any other business; we have the same components that we can manage effectively to deal with it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Rick, just one clarification on your prepared remarks and then a question on the food cost sort of things, you gave good clarity in terms of the basket, I think you said a five, four, and three for the three markets, but then you kind of mentioned if things don\u2019t ease in the near-term those could prove conservative, just wondering in terms of that basket like how much of that is actually secured and therefore not vulnerable I guess versus the floating where you\u2019re vulnerable to that further inflation. I am just trying to get some clarity by region in terms of what kind of assumption you\u2019re making for the rest of the year that perhaps is not locked. ", "Then secondly just on the YRI and I guess sales and margins. I know over the first half of the year you had talked about perhaps stronger sales and profit growth in the second half. Seems like you always had a I guess sluggish sales at YRI, but yet the margins were up significantly both operating and restaurant, I am just wondering, I know it\u2019s tough to aggregate 100 plus countries, but is it possible to talk about where the comp fell short of expectation and on the flip side the drivers of the margin and the related sustainability despite the comp? Thank you.", "Rick Carucci ", "Let me start with the food question then we\u2019ll go to the YRI sales, then we\u2019ll go to YRI margins. On the cost of sales, we\u2019re basically pretty much hedged for about six to nine months depending on the market right now. So we\u2019re fairly well locked in and if I had to dimensionalize, I\u2019ll use our two biggest markets, China and the U.S. If food costs don\u2019t come down, we figure we probably have about $40 million of further exposure, about $25 million of that in China and $15 million in the US. We\u2019ll obviously give updates later in the year as those unfold, but that\u2019s sort of the nature of the risk that\u2019s out there. Regarding YRI, why don\u2019t I let David talk a little bit about the sales piece of that and I\u2019ll come back to the margin side of it.", "David Novak ", "Yes, I think that first of all, I think we have been operating in a tough macro environment. One of the things I\u2019m really pleased with is that, we are making the investment and time and effort to really develop the future dayparts and more opportunities for our customers so that we can leverage the sales assets and I think these are going to take time for us to get that done. We step back and take a look at what we could have done better at YRI the last year. We think we should\u2019ve done a better job just with innovating around our core base brands and having more effective beat year ago marketing and operating programs and I think as we pursued the long-term, we didn\u2019t have the right balance and what I think we really have to do going forward in the team is addressing this is that we\u2019ve got to have the magic event better beat year ago core brand innovation both Pizza Hut and in KFC and continue to make progress on the sales layers. I think we have that balance but I am really glad that we really jumped in big time on the dayparts, multiple proteins and things like non-fried options. So, I think that\u2019s going to bode well for the future. But we need to more beat year ago core innovation. If you look at the sales, I think the developed economies really struggled the most Japan, Canada, Australia, that\u2019s where we had the softer sales and we were hopeful that those markets will make progress in 2011.", "Rick Carucci", "", "On the margin question Jeff with your point is sort of hard to aggregate but the two main drivers that point to, one was the refranchising helps with the Taiwan refranchising probably got us a little more than half of the full year margin improvement and the second, Thailand, which is mostly company-owned market, performed extremely well during 2010 and that drove margins. The other countries we had some ups and some down that basically balanced themselves out during the course of the year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.", "Andrew Barish \u2013 Jefferies", "One quick just backward-looking explanation. The fourth quarter, you were looking for a China inflation on the food cost line. It wound up coming in deflationary and you leveraged food cost without the benefit of the price increase you just took. What switched up there over the course of the last few months?", "Rick Carucci", "", "There wasn\u2019t one dominant item that improved the numbers. We did a little better than what we expected to do on the chicken line. We expected a little bit more chicken inflation than what we received but other than that it was a little bit everywhere as opposed to one item.", "David Novak", "", "And Andy just in addition to that. You\u2019re looking at the year-over-year change. We did get pretty close to the inflation we expected but we were also lapping higher food cost a year ago because we did have when you look at the year last year when we typically do in a quarter there was much more value orientation because if you remember, we were still really kind of in the slow economic times.

You heard the wage inflation. That wage inflation, not a huge part of your P&L but it\u2019s so sizable and you have commodity inflation that\u2019s there.

So, if you would, maybe talk about pricing at Taco Bell specifically as well?", "Rick Carucci", "", "First of all, Joe to your point, I think our philosophy in general is, we like to go with smaller earlier price increases than waiting until you have to take it and then having a large increase. We think that generally the consumer handles that better. When things are tight, you obviously have to provide. The magic of it, you\u2019ve been in the business a long time, Joe. As you know, you have to balance providing the value and taking the pricing and how do you get that right. ", "So, Taco Bell was more an example of what we\u2019re doing with our innovation calendar than sizable price increase. We\u2019ve taken very modest price increases at Taco Bell so that last year and first part of this year, but there what we also look at is what we are promoting and what those items are. What happened during the first part of 2010, we were promoting generally given the economy lower-priced items and in the back half of the year with the big box instead of the $5 box and other initiatives, we were promoting some higher-priced items getting the balance of little bit more normal.

First, Howard, I think it depends where you. I think in a one period of time we expect to be able to price with inflation. Again, we think we have a strong enough brand to be able to do that and I don\u2019t call it price, I call menu mixed management and pricing somewhat what we talked about Taco Bell earlier so we use both of those tools over time. In terms of fourth quarter 2010 and first quarter 2011, we probably were overlapping very high margins for China as we didn\u2019t necessarily think we\u2019re sustainable. So we still like our ability to be 20% plus in margins but it is a challenge overlapping in the short-term some of those inflation numbers.

Regarding your first question, Howard on the Tiers is that you\u2019re right. What basically is the difference in the margins, there is always some differences between the tiers, but it\u2019s really the Tier 1 margins are lower than the margins for the country, and that\u2019s primarily driven by real estate. There is other costs that are higher in the Tier 1 cities, but probably the thing that\u2019s changed over that 10-year period is, there is leases are a lot more expensive today than they were 10-years ago. We still get very good returns there. We\u2019re continuing to develop there.

It\u2019s really just the Tier 1 not quite as high as they were before, they\u2019re still quite strong. I think the number we gave in December meeting was about in the 19% range.

Where would the increase in CapEx come from or why would you need that? Is there a refresh cycle anywhere that needs to pick up?

First of all, there was a fair amount of our development, especially on the Company side that occurred in the fourth quarter. So, there was actually about $50 million of accruals relative to the CapEx that didn\u2019t show up in the cash flow statement. So, effectively the number was about 840 just in pure CapEx and then there was $15 million in key money and land use rights for China that shows up in other investments.

As we try to build out France and Germany, you\u2019ve seen some of that already in that the mix of those countries are higher costs than some of our other pieces.

In fact, our vision is to be the defining global company, in the pizza world, and you\u2019re not going to do that with brands that are piecemealed out. So, we see our self as a global branded company. We\u2019re making some choices here in terms of how we wanted to really focus on, what makes our company different. I think what makes our company different is, nobody has a business like we have in China, not only with Pizza Hut, not only with KFC, but now with Pizza Hut Casual Dining and we\u2019ve got East Dawning and Pizza Hut Home Service coming along, so we got a unprecedented position in China that we want to keep talking about. The other thing that makes this difference is YRI and in particular the growth that we have that\u2019s coming in the emerging markets.

So everything counts in this Company, everybody is bonused on their piece at Yum!. I can assure you that the Pizza Hut U.S. guys and the KFC U.S. guys are focused on growing sales and profits the right way and we have lots of discipline around that. The thing that really makes our Company different, are China, emerging markets and Taco Bell, plus the enormous cash flow we generate. This year we\u2019re looking at least $2 billion, you just saw that we had an authorization to buy $750 million worth of stock, we\u2019ve steadily increased our dividend in the past, so we pay $1 dividend and that kind of free cash flow is pretty powerful. So those are the things we want to talk about and I think that\u2019s what our shareholders are most interested in.

So, what wasn\u2019t positive in the world that dragged it to flat as there are one or two regions where comps were significantly negative or countries that did that?", "David Novak", "", "First, John, you got to keep in mind that that\u2019s we didn\u2019t identify what portfolio impact might be in those numbers. So, just by doing a simple math you can\u2019t necessarily get to what comps might be, but having said that there are several of our larger developed countries that had slightly negative comps like Japan for the full year was minus 1, Canada was minus 2, and Australia was minus 2.", "John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Pizza Hut Causal Dinning in China, it wasn\u2019t too longer maybe a year or so ago, we talked about slowing development in some of the major markets because the returns weren\u2019t as strong. I think that\u2019s if I remember that correctly, now you are comping up double digits. So what is happening is it the result of maybe slowing development of those markets where you\u2019ve seen now a surge in comps or is there something happening in the Chinese consumer where our brand is doing a lot better than the mid tier consumer in China, what is driving those very, very strong results?", "Rick Carucci", "", "I think first of all, we have done a really good job with the brand. So, the brand not only has it increased its variety, it\u2019s improved its value at the same time. So, we have more value price pieces on the menu which sort of expands its reach. The other is that the wealth continues to come in China. So, people in Tier 3, and Tier 4 cities, tier point, we were cautious, that\u2019s why we were cautious, we were having trouble now with our first unit in Tier 3 cities, but with our second unit in Tier 3 cities. So when the market helped us because the people got wealthier. The second is, we are doing more development in newer cities, cities that are new to Pizza Hut in Tier 3 and Tier 4.

In China, the direction that we\u2019ve given to Sam Su and his team is that you\u2019ve got two phenomenal brands in KFC and Pizza Hut, they are diamonds. You got to just keep polishing that diamond and make it greater. What we never want to do is get our growth out ahead of our capability and our ability to generate great returns for our shareholders. So a couple of years ago, we did see some issues that we needed to address. The team went to work and came up with a dramatic way to drive same-store sales, improve the unit economics and now we\u2019re expanding more aggressively.

The main thing you got to do is make sure they stay diamonds and keep polishing them and polish them and we watch our capital like you can\u2019t believe. People always said are growing too fast? The answer is no. We\u2019re all over the fact that we\u2019re getting great returns. The minute we seem to look like we\u2019re not, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll tell you what the issues are.

One is obviously a lot of strength in emerging Asia and now Africa. Just wanted to ask about a continent that we don\u2019t usually talk about which is Latin America. It looked like, so you refranchised Mexico, it looked like the system-wide sales were actually fairly good I thought in Latin America. But I am trying to think about, is it something about that part of the world that maybe is less attractive as a market for KFC or Pizza Hut for whatever reason. So, that\u2019s a question one. Then follow-up question was, just when thinking about Taco Bell growth in the U.S., do you still need to add AUVs or have you gotten to a place where you feel like your volumes are sufficient and you have a model that sets you up to growth to add those 3,000 stores?", "Rick Carucci", "", "In terms of Latin America, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with Latin America. Our history there has been always been the greatest, but Latin America as a whole is there. If you look at our system sales growth for the year was plus 8%. The issue there is we don\u2019t have any really power countries outside of Mexico where we have a lot of units. Our history there has not been as strong in some of the bigger countries and I\u2019ll talk about Brazil in a second. On Mexico, we have a good business in Mexico. We just didn\u2019t see that first of all, the franchisee we sold it to is as we said before, is a (indiscernible) franchise. He will do a great job with the brands. We just weren\u2019t seeing the returns and the dynamic growth that we were hoping to see there. So, I think part of that is just that Mexico has not quite grown to the level that we hoped it would. ", "The country that has grown at that level has been Brazil. Unfortunately for us, our history there was, KFC we had failed twice before we went in the third time. We actually feel good about how the brand is developing there. We have a new partner that we added a couple years ago, who we think is a strong partner, but we\u2019re still building the brand there and are ready to expand the brand there aggressively. Having said that, in some of the other smaller countries in Latin America we have some great brands. We have very strong brands in Central America; we have good brands in the Caribbean and obviously, we look at the rest of South America as opportunities for us and I\u2019d say we have some good countries there, like Columbia et cetera is growing at a pretty rapid rate, but we don\u2019t have power in some other countries that other people have.", "David Novak", "", "I want to use this opportunity to reinforce again our use of capital.

We want to talk about Latin America more. We just got bigger things right now that highlight the difference in our Company. Taco Bell, we believe that we already are getting net new unit growth at Taco Bell with high margins in the relatively high average unit volumes in our U.S. system. What we really need at Taco Bell is incremental sales layer. That\u2019s why we are working hard to develop breakfast. We are working hard to develop our beverage line with a real skew towards appealing to our target audience and that\u2019s why we are working on ways that we can get into higher ticket dinner, home meal replacement items.

And some of our more developed emerging marketplace like Indonesia, Philippines, the places where we have a lot of units, clearly those places people have the same equation that we talked about, China and the US had a managed inflation in that environment and usually what happens is there is a bit of a lag, if inflation goes, we\u2019re already high in a particular country, you can\u2019t price at all for tomorrow and you usually have to get a chunk of it first but that\u2019s on a country-by-country basis. So, we think our franchises are pretty smart. They are obviously pretty good at protecting their bottom-line and growing the brand at the same time. ", "Rick Carucci ", "Okay, so let me wrap things up. Thanks again for being on the call. As we continue to execute against our global growth opportunities, I think you can tell that our business model is increasingly involving into higher growth, high return businesses. For 2011 we believe that all of our businesses are better prepared to drive sales. Importantly, keep in mind that about half of our EPS growth will be driven by the new units that we built last year and units to be built this year. We continue to expect EPS growth of at least 10% for 2011 which will mark the 10th consecutive year we meet our annual target of at least 10% growth and we\u2019re confident we will continue to build the value of our company in 2011 and beyond. ", "From a personal standpoint I\u2019ve never been excited about leading this company in the coming years, we are on the ground floor growth and we got the people and all the resources takes to make it a reality.

Wednesday, July 13, our second quarter earnings will be released and will follow with a call in the next morning. Wednesday, August 3, we will host a YRI Investor Day in Dallas, Texas. Thursday, September 8, we will host our China Investor Conference in Shanghai.", "On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak", "Thank you very much, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Let me first start by addressing the tragic events that continue to impact people in Japan. We're relieved that our people are safe and that none of our team members were among the thousands who lost their lives during the earthquake and the devastating tsunami that followed. Our thoughts and our prayers are with our Japanese partners as our people recover from this tragedy, and a special thanks to our Japanese partners there who just have been working round the clock to make this be as least of an issue as possible for our people, and they've done a great job.", "Now if you recall in 2010, when we said that it was perhaps our best year ever as a public company and as a result, we entered 2011 with a solid momentum. I'm pleased to announce that our 2 major growth engines, China and Yum! Restaurants International continued to produce strong results in the first quarter. In fact, China's results were simply outstanding. These results have -- were dampened by U.S. profits driven primarily by negative publicity from false claims against the quality food we have at Taco Bell. Otherwise, we would have had a double-digit EPS growth quarter excluding special items. ", "Now on to our strategies. Let me start with our China business where our strategy is to build leading brands in every significant category. Rick Carucci and I just met with the team in Shanghai and believe me, we are making it happen. ", "Operating profits grew 18% prior to foreign currency translation benefit and same-store sales jumped a remarkable 13%. Combined with the 12% increase in units, system sales grew 24% for the quarter. Even more impressive, same-store transactions increased 15%, which is our largest increase in transactions since 2004. This exceptional increase in traffic gives us even more confidence that our category leading brands are stronger than ever and well positioned for a sustained growth ahead. ", "Our KFC business just keeps getting stronger. Same-store sales grew 14% in the quarter, and we continue to make good progress growing average unit volumes with 24-hour operations, delivery service, and we're building a solid Breakfast business. We added 78 units in the first quarter and now have over 3,300 KFCs in China, which is 2,000 more restaurants than our nearest competitor. ", "Our business continues to expand deep into China, striking a balance between KFC classics and menu offerings unique to the Chinese taste like congee for breakfast and rice-based entr\u00e9es. We had breakfast at KFC, and I tell you, the products are just fantastic. Continuous product innovation and operational excellence keeps the brand vibrant. It's growing and extremely profitable.", "Now onto Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China continues to be a huge success story. We had another fantastic quarter, delivering 12% same-store sales growth. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. Our Pizza and more positioning, backed by our strategy to refresh the menu every 6 months, as well as offering compelling value is resonating with our consumers in driving results. ", "We have more than 530 restaurants in over 130 cities, and we added 13 new locations in the first quarter. Clearly, Pizza Hut is well positioned for a sustained growth ahead. We also continue to make progress developing our emerging brands. Pizza ", "Hut Home Service now has 120 units in 11 cities and East Dawning, our Chinese fastfood brand, has 21 units in 4 cities. Angela Loh, our East Dawning General Manager and her team, are working hard in improving unit economics with the goal of developing a successful national brand. ", "Additionally, we own 27% of Little Sheep, the leading brand in the Hot Pot category, which is the largest casual dining category in China.", "In summary, our China business continues to fire on all cylinders. We've never been more confident in the strength and growth prospects of our business. Hats off to Sam Su and his world-class team who are clearly delivering dynasty-like performance for each of our brands. I don't know a lot of Chinese, but I do know the phrase, [Chinese], which means build more.", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International, YRI, where our strategy is to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. YRI produced solid results in the quarter with system sales growth of 6% and operating profit growth of 8%, prior to the benefit of foreign currency translation. Same-store sales increased 2%, and restaurant margin improved 1.4 percentage points. ", "New unit development, which like China is a key driver of growth for this business, continued with 131 new units this quarter. Over 90% of these units were opened by our strong network of franchisees. Overall, we continue to expect to open about 900 units at YRI for the full year. We remain very focused on development in emerging markets. 90 of our 131 new restaurants this quarter were opened in emerging markets, where YRI now has 6,400 restaurants across 67 countries, a level that is unmatched by our competitors. ", "I'm particularly pleased with our performance in the world's second largest emerging market, India, where we're investing capital as well as planning for a significant franchisee development. Our business in India grew system sales over 40% in the first quarter, including 13% same-store sales growth. The big news is our KFC business, where we now have 108 restaurants. Remember, crossing the 100-unit threshold is a significant milestone that enables accelerated growth. ", "The India team has gone to school in the China business and is following the same road map by developing dayparts and tailoring the menu to local taste. For example, we have a delicious line of vegetarian products. My favorite is the Zinger vegetarian sandwich, which is fantastic. And we're building a significant beverage layer with tremendous variety in both hot and cold drinks through our Krush Bar, which we're treating as a restaurant within a restaurant. Basically, a specialty store as a beverage center. We also have world-class operations that bring it all together. ", "Overall, I'm absolutely delighted at how Indian consumers have taken to our brands and extremely optimistic about our enormous future growth opportunity in this country.", "Speaking of opportunities in emerging markets, I just spent 2 days in Jakarta, where KFC and Pizza Hut are Indonesia's leading brands. And with over 240 million people in the country, we like our position there. Indonesia is the largest KFC developer in YRI, and we just opened our 400th KFC last week. We have 4x as many restaurants as our nearest competitor in a commanding market share. ", "Our Pizza Hut brand now has 200 restaurants in the country. It took nearly 20 years to reach our first 100, but only 5 years to build the next 100. Another example of that magic in reaching 100 units in a country. I was told by our franchise partner, Stephen McCarthy, that the definition of pizza in Indonesia is Pizza Hut, followed by a comma and then Pan Pizza. And after spending a day with Stephen and seeing some of the best restaurants in the world and the energetic teams that they have there, I'll take his word for it. Even with over 600 KFCs and Pizza Hut restaurants combined, we only have 2 restaurants per 1 million people in the Indonesia. We're clearly on the ground floor of growth in this emerging market.", "In addition to our growth opportunities with KFC and Pizza Hut, we believe that Taco Bell will become Yum!'s third global brand. We've entered 10 new countries over the past 2 years and expect to enter 4 more this year. Now building the brand in a new country is not easy, but we're betting that Taco Bell will be a long-term growth driver. ", "In summary, YRI growth and development is on track and delivering solid results. We're pleased with the progress we're making with same-store sales growth and restaurant margins. Longer term, we continue to build our category-leading position in emerging markets, and look for a continued growth ahead.", "In the United States, we had a challenging quarter, no doubt about it. Same-store sales fell 1%, and our restaurant margin has declined 1.6 percentage points. Taco Bell, our most profitable U.S. brand, began the year with strong momentum and grew same-store sales 4% in the first period. Unexpectedly, as I mentioned earlier, our positive sales momentum was reversed when we were thrown a curveball with the false claim around our food quality. This impact has lingered longer than we anticipated, given it was an imagined story versus reality. ", "What has happened is that research shows our heavy users are basically maintaining their frequency, and remain very loyal to Taco Bell. However, light users are staying on the sidelines for the time being, and have reduced their purchase frequency. As a result, our overall reach has narrowed slightly but enough to impact sales trends significantly and take the fun out of the business. The good news is that this is a meritless lawsuit, and it was withdrawn by the Alabama law firm after reviewing the facts. The team will leverage this event and is working on other solutions to recapture the sales momentum we had at the beginning of the year.", "So let me wrap this up. All things considered, we had a solid quarter. China is stronger than ever and continues to be a tremendous growth engine. YRI performance was solid, and the U.S. results are disappointing. As we look forward, we are very excited about our position as a leader in emerging markets. We also remain confident that 2011 will be the 10th consecutive year we achieve our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth. ", "Now let me turn it over to Rick Carucci, our CFO, who will take you through the numbers.", "Richard Carucci", "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today I'm going to focus on 2 areas. First, I'm going to give some context to our first quarter results. And then, I'll discuss the outlook for the balance of 2011. As David mentioned, our first quarter results were a tale of 2 cities. Our strong international results offset negative performance in the U.S. and helped us deliver EPS growth of 7%, excluding special items. On the positive side, foreign currency translation for both YRI and China provided about a $12 million pretax benefit or roughly a $0.02 EPS benefit. On the other hand, our tax rate was 27.1% compared to 25.7% last year. This was about a 2% drag on our EPS growth.", "Now let's take you through each of the divisions. China produced another outstanding quarter driven by new unit development and transaction growth. This allowed us to grow profits 18% prior to foreign currency translation, while taking modest pricing actions towards the end of January. Our check during the quarter actually declined slightly as we also offered compelling value for breakfast and snacking occasions at a time when Chinese consumers were sensitive to rising prices. ", "We ended the quarter with a healthy 25% restaurant margin. This is a 1.5 point decrease from the record levels posted in the first quarter of 2010. As expected, about 1 point of this decline was commodity and wage inflation, while the business tax had an impact of 0.5 point as well. But overall, as CFO, I was quite satisfied with the 25% first quarter margin in China.", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International posted a solid quarter. We grew system sales by 6% prior to foreign currency translation and improved restaurant margins 1.4 percentage points. Sales growth was led by a significant strength in our emerging markets and YRI's less developed markets. We had strong sales results in India, Africa, France and Germany. Margins benefited from a continued strong performance from our KFC businesses in the U.K., France and Thailand. Our Pizza Hut U.K. and KFC Australia businesses were a drag on first quarter restaurant margins and operating profits. ", "We are preparing the launch of a new menu and service proposition for the Pizza Hut U.K. Dining business. Based on test results, we are hopeful this will improve base business performance in the second half of the year. We also plan to re-franchise about 100 Pizza Hut units in the U.K. this year. ", "At KFC Australia, we are encouraged by the introduction of the Streetwise value menu that took place in the back end of the first quarter. ", "Finally, the U.S. division had a disappointing first quarter. We saw a 13% profit decline and a 1% drop in same-store sales. As David mentioned, clearly, the publicity from the lawsuit against Taco Bell had a negative impact on sales. We were surprised by the magnitude and the sustained nature of the sales impact that this event had on our business.", "The U.S. first quarter results also reflected lower sales and a negative year-over-year re-franchising impact to Pizza Hut. On the whole, our U.S. restaurant margins declined 1.6 percentage points versus prior year. This was due to inflation, as well as an unfavorable menu mixture driven by value initiatives.", "Unfortunately, we do not expect the second quarter in the U.S. to get better. In fact, we believe it will be the low point of the year for the U.S. segment. We have not yet been able to reverse the negative sales trend at Taco Bell. If anything, sales have gotten a little bit weaker since the end of the quarter and it is difficult to predict exactly when we will break this trend. We are hopeful that the withdrawal of the lawsuit will be the first step towards sales recovery.", "Now let me talk some more about what we expect for the rest of the year. Despite some tough sledding in the first half in the U.S. and some inflation headwinds, we expect 2011 to be another strong year for Yum!. China will once again be Yum!'s leading profit driver for the full year. I was just in China with David, and I agree that the China business is stronger than ever. I was particularly pleased with the strong development performance. Not only do we open 92 restaurants in the first 2 months of the year, but the profitability and returns of the new units that we have recently opened remain very strong. It is great when you get to see both quantity and quality in new unit development.", "Despite our strong sales growth in China, we still face some profit challenges during the balance of the year. The commodity and labor inflation we saw in the first quarter will continue. We are now estimating commodity inflation of about 7% for the full year. As a reminder, we had already increased our labor inflation estimate to the mid-teens during our comments last quarter. We will also be overlapping the $15 million profit benefit of our participation in the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. This will have its strongest impact in the third quarter.", "Fortunately though, we have the benefit of strong sales growth. And as David outlined, our 2 leading brands are stronger than ever. While managing inflation is a challenge, we do not believe that it weakens our competitive advantage in any way. Higher wages improve the purchasing power of the Chinese consumer and make our brands affordable to more people. ", "Also, as we demonstrated in the first quarter, our full-day menu offering and our broad national penetration provide us with more options for managing inflation than our competitors. When you put it all together, we expect 2011 to be a strong year of sales and profit growth.", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we've gotten off to a solid start and we expect that to continue for the remainder of the year. In terms of headwinds in that division, we expect Japan profits to be down $3 million to $6 million due to the impact of the tragic earthquake and tsunami. In the third quarter at YRI, we'll incur the expense of our biannual franchisee convention.", "Commodity inflation has less direct impact in this division due to the fact that 90% of the business is franchised. However, the improving global economy, strong performance in emerging markets and new unit development should all combine to drive sales and profits for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, at YRI, we expect our new units to drive about 1/2 of our profit growth for the full year.", "Finally, in the U.S., we expect our performance to recover after it bottoms out in the second quarter. Given the value-conscious consumer in the U.S., high gas prices and high food inflation, we know it's going to be a challenging year. Clearly, the key to our improvement in the U.S. relies heavily on our ability to turn around sales trends at Taco Bell. We do have a favorable G&A comparison in the fourth quarter due to higher-than-normal costs in 2010.", "Overall, we'll be very focused on managing our costs in every area of our business. Our re-franchising efforts in the U.S. this year are largely focused around KFC. Our goal remains to reduce KFC company ownership from the current 15% level to about 5%. We only re-franchised 9 units in the first quarter, but we expect to pick up the pace in the balance of the year. While it's unlikely that we will reach the 5% level by the end of 2011, we do expect to make meaningful progress towards that goal. Please remember our biggest priority in re-franchising is to ensure that we find the best operator for our brand.", "So when we look at China, YRI and the U.S. together, here are our quarterly profit expectations: We expect a rough second quarter in the U.S.; we have some modest year-over-year overlap challenges in China and YRI in the third quarter; and we expect strong across-the-board growth in the fourth quarter. We certainly faced some profit challenges this year, it looks like it will be a bumpy year and a more back-end loaded profit year than I originally expected. ", "However, I have a lot of confidence in the Yum! business model. I feel better than ever about our China business and take comfort knowing that the strongest brands fared the best during inflationary times. YRI is on solid footing with an improving global economy and a powerful development engine. The U.S. is going to be a challenge but I know that Taco Bell is a powerful resilient brand and that it will bounce back. ", "I feel very fortunate that we have such a strong global portfolio. Despite a few bumps in the road, I remain confident that we'll end the year in a stronger position than when we started. I am also confident that Yum! will deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2011, excluding special items. This will mark the 10th year in a row of our keeping our target. Back to you, David.", "David Novak", "All right, great. Thank you very much, Rick. And why don't we open it up for Q&A?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I wanted to ask about the China same-store sales growth, which is phenomenal. Just kind of what you see is the drivers, whether for example you saw a difference in Tier 1 or 2 cities versus 3 to 6? Whether -- it seems like maybe you took some pricing, but yet because of promotions, Czech [ph] was down. Does that mean you kind of cracked the code on some of inside of marketing campaign that could be sustainable and you could drive sales? Just kind of some context around how you think you got there and what you think is sustainable.", "David Novak", "I think the biggest thing that's going on right now is that we obviously have a tremendous operating team in China and operational excellence is the name of the game there. 80% of our restaurant managers have at least a college education, and they're -- we're very focused on leveraging our assets. And I think the great news for China is we're at the ground floor in 3 emerging segments out of the KFC asset. And that is: #1, breakfast, we're still way under 10% in terms of mix of breakfast, yet we've got a tremendous value menu for breakfast, RMB 6 fantastic products, and breakfast is a growth segment for us; #2 is home delivery. Most of our restaurants in China are not drive-through because they are basically in-lines because of the dense locations. But home delivery in effect is the drive-through vehicle for those units and it's doing well. So home and business delivery, being able to take our products to the customer is working for us. And then I think the third thing that is driving our business performance is the expansion of 24-hour service. And so, if you'd look at 24-hour service, home delivery and breakfast, these are 3 significant ways to leverage our asset that we're in the early days on, and we think that the growth that we will get from these segments will be sustainable. The other thing that the team has done an excellent job of is really offering a great value in our core business as well. And all of the brand majors that we have are moving in the right direction. So that's KFC. Do you have anything to add on KFC, Rick?", "Richard Carucci", "I would just add regarding your question around the tiered cities, is that, we had strong growth across the board. It was especially strong in the smaller tiered cities which outperformed the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, but we were pleased with the performance everywhere. And to build on David's point about snacking and breakfast, I mentioned in my speech, we felt we had some good value initiatives there, which we will continue throughout the rest of the year.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then on China, you also made a point to translate for us the phrase, build more. I guess, does that imply that maybe you might accelerate your expansion there because even with that phrase translated, you haven't necessarily done it in the last year or 2?", "David Novak", "Yes, I guess 550 restaurants is not that much expansion. I think we're pretty happy with our rate of development. We're not making any announcement that we're going to accelerate any further than that. But we continue to build people capability. The great thing is that our unit economics continue to be fantastic, not only KFC but even more so now with Pizza Hut because that brand has been dramatically turned around and through the additional variety that we've offered in the casual dining format and the everyday value proposition. So I think in total last year, we did I think 507 restaurants. We're basically in that camp this year. We have great unit economics, and we'll continue to grow as the opportunities present themselves.", "Richard Carucci", "Just to build on David's point, with the Pizza Hut  brand, those who recall, a couple of years ago, we were struggling a little bit with our second units in Tier 3 cities. And now, the good news is those are performing better. And in fact, our early Pizza Hut performance in Tier 4 cities is also strong. So we do think we have a bigger opportunity to grow units in Pizza Hut than we had historically.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Richard Carucci", "You bet.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "Thanks. Obviously, China was very strong, and I wonder how we should be thinking about that business for this year? Obviously, the traffic number was a little bit higher than the same-store sales and I understand you did some value in the quarter. Is this a kind of year that you're going to be -- you have a strategy that you've sort of discovered here in the first quarter that you're going to stick with, where you're pushing value, perhaps holding back on pricing, this is going to be something that resonates with the consumer in a world of inflation over there and perhaps holds you in good stead for even future years, and you're willing to sacrifice some profitability to do that? Or is this more of an extreme version of the P&L impact that we should expect in future quarters? In other words, value may not be as much of a focus in future quarters and perhaps of which you expect moderating same-store sales and better profitability?", "David Novak", "I think, David, the value proposition for KFC, Pizza Hut, our brands, is always going to be paramount. Because what we want to do is make our brands as affordable and ubiquitous for all Chinese customers as that economy continues to bring in more and more users to our brands and just more and more consumers to the countries. So value is something that will be ongoing and something that we will always make a major priority. I think the big thing that we've unlocked is the power of the asset that we have, through the development of breakfast, home delivery and 24-hour service. And this is driving the vast majority of our growth that we have. And as I mentioned earlier, we're really on the ground floor of each of those segments. And so I think the combination of the value plus the asset leverage puts us in a very good shape to continue to drive same-store sales and traffic over the long term. Now obviously, the kind of traffic growth we had this quarter is amazing. And so, we're not saying that's going to happen. But we definitely believe that the China model, the China growth model as it relates to Yum! is in great for years to come.", "Richard Carucci", "I would say versus our typical model year, we have smaller same-store sales growth and less inflation. This year, we expect to have more inflation and more same-store sales growth than our typical model. Our typical model is about 4% to 6% rate of same-store sales. I do expect this year it'll be more than that, but we need it because of the inflation.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "And if I can just make a comment about the whole Taco Bell situation and that is that, the fact that you could have what seems to be, with inflation heating up, Taco Bell should have been questioning it this year. I know your team was excited about the innovation pipeline that you have in place. I feel bad about for your franchisees, who are independent business people, the suppliers, that this year is playing out the way that it is. What sort of plan b are you guys implementing there, given the fact that the brands in the different place, maybe you're not going to be trying to do as much innovation trade up as you might have been? What adjustments are you making to the marketing at Taco Bell?", "David Novak", "Yes. Well, thank you for your comments, David. It's just been an absolute outrage frankly. For now, what we're doing is we're focused on just running great restaurants, serving great products and just reassuring our customers about the quality and integrity at Taco Bell. Unfortunately for the lawyers, they picked the wrong corporate pocket, okay?  And I'm really proud of Greg Creed and the Taco Bell team for standing up to this ridiculous case. Clearly, this was a case where we were sued first and asked later. They made false statements about our products. We provided them and the court with statements from our suppliers and our labs, and they dropped the case, which is extremely rare and is proof positive that we are in the right here. There were no charges, no money, no releases, they just dropped the case. So we got -- the story is now getting out, and we think that is good news. In terms of our marketing strategy, we're looking at a number of different ways to really lift the brand up from this unfortunate situation that was caused by the law firm. And we have a good calendar, a strong calendar. And what we're going to do is we're going to get back, focused on executing that calendar and listening and responding to the voice of the customer. We're looking at all of our options right now on how to deal with the situation. But the great news is that, as you know, Taco Bell is a great QSR brand with no significant national competitor. And we're going to get back to just doing what we do best, and that's selling our food and giving customers great service. And so, we're optimistic that we will be able to get the business turned around, but we've got some work to do. As I mentioned earlier, the heavy user is very loyal to us and is basically, stuck with us to a good extent. But we've lost our light user base, and that's reduced our overall reach. We got a -- hopefully the dismissal of the suit is the first step of us beginning to get our entire franchise back where it ought to be.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "Thanks, David.", "David Novak", "Thanks, Dave.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Thanks. Just another question on China. As we think about the past, many years, in China building scale, with focus on rapid unit growth and increasing asset utilization. I'm just wondering, in the context of a much higher inflation environment, what you're views might be about opportunities, perhaps to initiate programs to improve cost management, perhaps in areas such as labor scheduling, food cost, the classic areas that perhaps could be new opportunities for the brands in China?", "Richard Carucci", "Well, obviously, we're looking at ways to improve our cost structure. As David said, they are very good operating team and they are always focused on how they could get more and more efficient on the -- as a reminder, too, it's one place where we do own our distribution system. So it does allow us to manage costs more directly in that area versus other folks. But as I said, I've said a little bit in my speech and I've said before, we do not fear this high-growth, high-inflation scenario. We actually don't fear that because we think we have more leverage to pull in managing inflation than the typical companies out there. As David mentioned, we have 24-hour, the breakfast, et cetera. We also have a national reach, so we can have a slightly different strategies in different parts of the country. We have been planning, and I think we're going to continue to plan that labor inflation is going to be there for a while. I'm personally less sure the commodity inflation will be there forever. Supply and demand tends to work, I think there's still a lot more productivity in the supply chain in general in China and its suppliers can get more productive. So clearly, we're going through an inflation bout now. We could handle it if it's ongoing. I'm just not sure if it's going to be ongoing.", "Jeffrey Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Thanks.", "David Novak", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Next we will hear from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes. Thank you, guys. Just wondering when you said, second quarter would be kind of the low point for the U.S. business. So what context do you mean there? You mean in terms of year-over-year EBIT growth or do you mean sequentially, or sort of getting a little bit more color on what you mean by that?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, probably in most areas. But in terms of year-over-year profit growth, even though you saw the first quarter was weak, we expect the second quarter to be worse. As I sort of mentioned, we're more dependent on Taco Bell than we've been historically. The sales trends, although we're lapping a little bit harder numbers in the second quarter, I did mention that since the end of the quarter, our year-over-year trends have actually gone a little bit worse than what you saw in the balance of the first quarter. So based on that, that's going to impact our profitability in the second quarter, and KFC had a decent second quarter last year. And so therefore, our U.S. business clearly we believe we'll have even lower profitability than it did in the first quarter year-over-year.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then, I guess, I'm a little surprised that Taco Bell has weakened as it's gotten away from the lawsuit. Do you think there's any other issues going on out there with the QSR consumer and that are new any way in terms of gas prices or whatever it may be?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes. I mean, clearly, that's another factor. But It's very clear, if you look at the sales trends, it was very clear that the cause of it was the publicity around the lawsuit. This is an example, we were running set plus 4% in the first 4 weeks of the year. The next week was down a little bit from that because of the weather, but we clearly saw that in areas that the weather wasn't bad, our sales were very strong. So it's only in areas where the weather was bad. And then, since then, it's been down. But probably the 1 thing that was a little bit of bad luck in the process is that we were running shrimp during Lent. And we think that was the right program at that time, but we had also committed to buying the shrimp during that period of time. And we were planning on that being a big driver. That turned out not being the case. We probably would have been better off if we had, had a lower price promotion at that point in time. But other than that, I don't see anything that we really could have done differently. Going forward, as David said, we're looking at all of the options. And I think we have a decent calendar, and I think some of the stuff just takes time. So we just need a little bit of time to get further away from the event. And the publicity piece of it is the leveraged on the front end, we'll see how -- whether that has an impact or not. That lawsuit was just dropped a day or 2 ago, so it's too early to tell whether that will have an immediate impact on our sales.", "David Novak", "Yes, I think what happened to us, as you know, is that the plaintiffs lawyers originally generated a ton of press coverage, giving press interviews and press releases and containing statements about our products that were just absolutely plain wrong and statements far beyond what they even included in their lawsuit. And unfortunately, the press gives far more coverage to the filing of the suits and the making of the claims than it ever gives that the fact that the lawyers have now given up. So while we dismissed the suit in terms of the ledger, or the communication it's going to be hard to get even. Okay? And so I think it's going to take us a little time. There's no question, in our industry, having high gas prices is not great. So I think all of us are working hard on making sure our value equation is right. But the basic Taco Bell brand is strong. And you can do -- it is so clear that as soon as that lawsuit hit, our sales took a dip. I mean it's absolutely correlated and then we track our users and our purchase frequency and intent to purchase throughout this process and during the Lent and the shrimps promotion, it was down. And it had nothing to do with the shrimp, it had everything to do with that damned lawsuit. And so that, to me, is what we're dealing with right now and we got a great team working on it and we'll get back. We are the value leader, and that's an important thing to be when gas prices are close to $4 so that's a big plus for us. And so, teams are working on how to dimensionalize that value as we go forward. So we like where we're at. We just been kind of put in the basement for a while. And now, we can get our head up and move forward. But the good news on this, I think it really has allowed us to tell everybody in the world that you're proud of our products, and we are.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. Thanks for the color, guys.", "David Novak", "Thanks, Jason.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Given that you have higher food costs expectations in China, how are you thinking about pricing going forward? And what is the political social sensitivity that's taking place in China at this point?", "Richard Carucci", "Well as a reminder, for everybody in what we've done so far, we took roughly about a 3% price increase at the end of January. And at that point in time, we thought it was going to cover about 3/4 of the inflation for the year. To your point, given that inflation has gone up, it's probably went more like 60% to 65% of the inflation for the year. So we we'll have to assess everything later in the year. We're not planning on doing anything in the next several months. We like what we've seen from the sales and transaction perspective, and we think we've got the overall profitability and value equation pretty good right now. But we'll assess later in the year and look what our options are then.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Rick, from a political or social standpoint, is there a lot of pressure not to take price in China?", "Richard Carucci", "We'll, we were probably late on our last price increase relative to other people, so we didn't feel any resistance when we took our last pricing increase. Obviously, there's been some feedback that other companies have gotten from the government, and that's something we'll keep an eye on.", "David Novak", "I think the biggest pressure we feel, Joe, is just the pressure to make sure that we're affordable to the emerging consumer. And that's why we like our equation right now, is that we're looking for ways to make our products and our brands more and more accessible. One of the reasons why Pizza Hut is doing so well is that it's eat like a rich man, eat like a poor man. We advertise it that way. We got something for the everyday consumer. To go into KFC and get a and we've got RMB 6 breakfast that I'm telling you is absolutely delicious and filling, that's great. That's where we want to go. I mean, If we can figure out how to take our prices lower, okay, especially with the kind of margins we have, that's where we want to be. And we want to make sure that our products are affordable as possible. We like our position and we like the formula that we have right now.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Guys, just a quick question on YRI as well. Same-store sales are a little bit better, but you still seem to be guys lagging, a lot of other companies, international businesses. And, I guess, I'm curious, is KFC versus Pizza Hut issue or is it more of the emerging markets versus developed markets?", "David Novak", "I think it's, If you look at the numbers, it's more of the weakness that we have in the developed markets versus the emerging markets. Our emerging markets story is extremely positive, and that's the real growth engine for our company. We've been soft and a little of both on the brand side and we 2 developed equity markets that are taking a little bit of the -- putting the damper on our performance. KFC Australia has been underperforming as has Pizza Hut U.K. And those are the 2 markets. In the second half of the year, we expect to -- we've got a relaunch of the Pizza Hut brand and the value proposition in the U.K. And in Australia, we have some very good sandwich-type news that we're hopeful is going to be able to turn the business around. Because there, we have a very strong portable business and we've got news that we think that will lift the brand up. So it's -- our emerging story is strong, our developed markets particularly with the 2 countries I talked about right now are the issue that we're dealing with.", "Operator", "Next we will hear from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Great. Thanks. Hey, just on China again, how much of the improvement in acceleration same-store sales do you think was due to the initiatives that you talked about versus maybe just the overall industry just picking up?", "Richard Carucci", "I don't know how to answer that. Yes, I don't know if I have anything better. I think it was a bit of both. Clearly, I think we had some very good initiatives. I think we benefit from having a national presence because the growth as I mentioned before, was a bit better in the outer tier, so I think that probably helped our relative performance. I think it was -- been of both [ph]. Clearly, as we started to talk about it, we're fairly focused on the same-store sales. But when we look at China, we also look at system sales because again, we're very heavily development dependent and focused because we want to keep building our business there. So when you look at those 2 combined and you have 24% systems sales, clearly, that's more than the category and I've  mentioned that our development numbers were very strong in the first quarter. So we'll continue to build on our more than 2,000 lead versus McDonald's.", "David Novak", "We'll just choose -- this quarter, just to say, it's all our doing. I mean, the beautiful thing about this and the reason we obviously, were excited about China is hey, the macros longer-term are better there than in other parts of the world. And so, it's nice to have that as a headwind. And that to me -- we just hope that keeps me on going. The more that economy's booming, the more consumers are buying our products, we're in the right place at the right time. Sometimes, I say is you're better to be lucky than good. In this case, hopefully, we're good and lucky.", "David Novak", "Well, you've done a really nice job there.", "Operator", "Next we will hear from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Great. Thank you. Just I guess a two-part question. First on the food cost side of things. It seems like you guys are not alone in terms of raising your the inflation forecast as we move through the year. It looks like you raised both China and U.S. by a couple hundred basis points in terms of the basket since just last quarter. I'm just wondering, what kind of visibility you have on that front locked versus floating. And the potential that there's pressure from here and then it goes up another couple of points over the next several quarters, and just kind of wondering about the U.S. and China, your visibility and comfort on that level. Well just kind of a natural follow-up, I mean, I think we heard you said in China, you got about 3% pricing running through. I'm just wondering you said you're not doing anything in the near term. How about in the U.S. in terms of kind of the right pricing level? And I guess for both U.S. and China, how much pricing would you need in an ideal world to actually protect your margin? I mean, putting up tremendous comps in China, still seeing the margin pressure and just kind of figure out, in this environment and inflation, how much pricing would you actually need?", "Richard Carucci", "If you look at the exposure this year, I think at this point, it's pretty modest versus our estimates. So it could probably go up a point or 2. I would think pretty at the most because we're starting to get more and more locked in obviously, as we're getting deeper into the year. The bigger issue is what happens to the trends going forward because that's really going to influence what our pricing is. It's not necessarily going to cover what occurred this year, but are those prices going to continue going forward. We don't have a lot of visibility to that right now. Clearly, in this you environment when you have the inflation, in the U.S. I'm talking about now, when you have inflation and your sales are soft, you have to play it pretty smartly and the teams are pretty good in doing that. Taco Bell historically has done a good of introducing newer products with higher price points, maybe higher $0.01 profit while still having great value initiatives. And they'll have to continue to do things like that at Taco Bell and love to do that in the other brands. So we'll probably take some modest pricing increases but, we'll have to still provide value at the same time.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "And in terms of I guess what you're currently running in pricing and if this inflation will sustain, like what pricing would be needed to neutralize that margin?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes. I mean, I mentioned before and if you look at the math in China, if you take the inflation that we talked about in the commodities side and take the inflation we've talked about before on the labor side, that gives you about 4.5% or so inflation, and we've taken 3% pricing. So that's pretty much what the gap is right now.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. 2 follow-ups, 1 is on China. In the past, you've talked about 1% to 2% of the comps coming from things like 24-hours and the breakfast, et cetera. Did that accelerate in the first quarter, in other words were there more stores open longer for some reason? Or is that still the right way to think about the 13%? And then it's a funny quarter for China and then 2 months and 1 is Chinese New Year and 1 is not. Did the trends on a comparable basis, were they pretty consistent to the quarter was this really about a very, very successful Chinese New Year?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, regarding the second piece first, John. It was pretty consistent during the quarter. So we didn't have either a fantastic Chinese New Year. We just -- after, before. It was pretty much constant throughout. So we were pleased with that part of it. We probably picked up a modest amount of extra growth because of further penetration of the KFC delivery 24 hours and the performance of breakfast. So breakfast segment performed very strongly during the quarter. But most of the increase versus what you would've seen before is really just overall business performing better.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "And can you quantify the impact of the declines or the profit impact of Taco Bell in the U.S. sort of flat. Were profits actually down at Taco Bell as a result of flat comps or was it just uplift and you saw with the other brands were then more...", "Richard Carucci", "Profits went down at Taco Bell.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Can you quantify how much of the decline of profits Taco Bell was responsible for?", "Richard Carucci", "More than half.", "David Novak", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Palace.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thanks very much. First off, I believe you did a refi [refinance] of your $650 million in deck. Can you give us a sense of how that went? Was it with cash or did you do a straight refi?", "David Novak", "We just paid off the $650 million of bonds that were due in April. So right after the end of the quarter, Mitch.", "Richard Carucci", "With cash.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Thank you. Next on YRI, I noticed that the G&A was up year-over-year in the first quarter. You did refranchise all of Mexico. Could you walk us through that? Do you expect G&A to go down year-over-year due to that refranchising? Or how should be model out the G&A in the YRI segment?", "David Novak", "Yes, I mentioned it was basically 4x driven. So that's the other side of the favorable aspect of foreign currency. You do get hit a little bit in G&A. So that was basically the reason. You get the favorable impact from Mexico and the rest of the business, they reinvested some of the proceeds, but the base business was basically flat. There was a little bit of increase due to FX.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And on the reinvesting, you do have an extra week this year. I believe last quarter, you mentioned you planned to reinvest it. Have you rethought that? Is there some cushion to meet the 10%-plus earnings growth by not reinvesting that extra week?", "Richard Carucci", "This year, we could use it as that. We haven't committed to it but our plan at this point, although we're not yet prepared to sort of decide on exactly what that will be, but our plan is that we are going to re-invest it.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And lastly, on the U.S. business, can you give us a sense at Taco Bell of what percent of your users are light users?", "Richard Carucci", "I'd have to get back to you on that.", "David Novak", "Mitch, we don't have that handy.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "But that is you think the key reason why the comps' trends did reverse?", "David Novak", "Yes, we absolutely know that for sure. Yes. We just forget exactly what that percentage is.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. Thank very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just a couple of follow ups if I may. The first and it's been asked in a lot of ways. And I'd like to just try 1 more, is the elasticity of pricing in China. I know in your prepared remarks, you said that it is a sensitive customer to pricing and perhaps even a sensitive government to pricing. But, for example, if your pricing, if it was 5% instead of 3%, do you think that the consumer is that sensitive to pricing from an elasticity point of view? Or do you think you have more pricing power than what you're currently taking. In other words, that the traffic is there that you could take pricing and not affect the traffic levels?", "Richard Carucci", "Well, obviously, we make the best judgment that we think is best for overall. In terms of the elasticity, when we've taken pricing historically, and it's been inflation driven and the economy has grown, it's been handled pretty well. We do want to remind people that the Chinese customer has definitely recovered from where they were. But the Chinese consumer is still a little bit nervous. If you look at the consumer confidence level, that's 1 of the measures we look at, over the last 4 months, that measure has been a pretty weak measure. So the Chinese, we think it's driven by nervousness around housing cost, et cetera. So we do think we have to be sensitive right now that the Chinese consumer, as David also said strategically, we want to make sure that we're affordable. So I don't want people to think that the Chinese consumer is not sensitive right now to value, because we think they are.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, understood. The second question is on real estate in China and certainly I respect that 550 is a very big number to open in a given year. From the outside looking in, it's tough to know if you're still getting the access to the quality, meaning both costs and locations of the real estate that you want, are you seeing costs significantly inflate? Or Are you finding it harder to sites or are you seeing the new projects being built in the areas in which you want to go?", "Richard Carucci", "Again, just a reminder, our historical development numbers ended the 500 range in the last couple of years. If you look at real estate in general, we are seeing fairly large increases in rent as they become due especially in tier, especially Tier 1 cities. So in those situations, we have done more relocations and things like that because it is harder to justify the new rent that you end up paying. In the rest of the countries, rents have gone up, but not nearly to the extent that they have in some of the Tier 1 cities. In terms of access to real estate, the things that have driven historical development we think are going to continue to drive future development. And you're continuing to see huge investments in infrastructure. We saw something like something like 40 airports being opened in China. So things like that continue to occur. So we haven't seen any let up in any infrastructure investment or investment in new cities that the Chinese government has been making. And so we still see people moving from the countryside into the city. So with that, you do get you new opportunities. So what we said historically, I think it's true going forward, it's really tied to the economic growth of the countries. If the economic growth in countries we think in the units will be there.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "The final question just on Pizza Hut. First quarter is actually a very strong year for the Pizza Hut category in general, very strong year for Pizza Hut. It was actually the easiest comparison if you want to call it 5 [ph] easy. But what's the outlook for the year in that brand? I mean, do you think that you can stabilize that business against very difficult comparisons or might it get pulled down in line with the category? If the category had such an exceptional 2010, that it might just give back from that share in 2011?", "David Novak", "We actually believe that we can have a stable year at Pizza Hut. So we're confident in the direction, our value proposition is good. And in the past, we admittedly, we had some boom splat [ph]. We don't think we'll have a boom splat [ph] this year.", "Richard Carucci", "Just the way -- P&L works this year for Pizza Hut in the U.S. We were expecting about flat-type of year-end profits. As we both said [ph] some modest sales growth would offset the impact of refranchising. Obviously, we didn't have that sales growth that we wanted in the first quarter, but we also did see any boom splat [ph].", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And is there anything changing from a marketing perspective in Pizza Hut that will be notable to turnaround that trend, the Q1 trend?", "David Novak", "I think one of the big thing that's changing versus the past is we have continuity in terms of every the value. In the past, we have kind of moved around a lot in that arena. But the systems committed to everyday value. So that gives us a base that we never really had before. We also have a good combination of innovation and value so you'll see some new pizzas coming to the customers. And the other thing is we continue to build our early week business with the pasta and the wings. So we think we have a good solid approach on Pizza Hut that gives us the stability we need to continue to build a healthy business.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Larry Miller with RBC.", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Two quick questions. I think you said when you were talking about refranchising KFC, and clearly, there's only a few -- 9 stores refranchised this quarter. You wanted to put it in the hands of good operators. Can you comment on the financial health of the KFC system at this point and then their ability to absorb that 11% of stores that you want to sell to them?", "Richard Carucci", "Well again, 1 of the things that makes KFC a little more challenging than the other brands is 1, is we started later, which we've talked about before for various reasons. The second is the existing franchisees, and we knew this going into it, having less capacity to handle more units. So some of the units, the majority of the units that we're actually selling on the KFC side are to external new franchisees, which takes a little bit longer to get financing, et cetera. Obviously, we were going through the screen of making sure that they will be good at operating the restaurants.", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "But you're confident you guys can hit that target?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes. What we said is our target is ultimately get to 5%. So we probably won't get to that target by the end of this year, but we'll get there eventually.", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then just 1 final question on China, clearly, double-digit traffic growth is amazing for this brand. I think as long as I've covered it and it happened maybe a few times. Is there anything different happening from a cannibalization perspective when you're opening new stores? And also can you comment on the maturity curve? Is that actually giving a greater than expected benefit [indiscernible]?", "Richard Carucci", "What do you mean by the maturity curve?", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "So maybe the stores are opening, the stores in some in the Tier 3, 4 markets operating at lower volumes and ramping up a little bit quicker to more mature volumes?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes. We're not really seeing anything on the second part of the maturity curve side. On cannibalization, so far nothing really major different there. If anything, as the percentage of new builds gets lower, we get maybe slightly better on the cannibalization front just from a map standpoint. We continue to operate new cities. Of the number of new cities we'll go into stay relatively constant. So as a percentage that's going down a little bit which works in the other direction. So I would say cannibalization, if I had to put those 2 together, maybe slightly better than what it's been historically.", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Steve West with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Steve West", "In past in the U.S., you guys have dealt with a lot of challenges to some of your brands, whether it's E. coli or kind of rats in New York City and you guys have recovered very quickly and done a good job of managing it. How has the Taco Bell recovery so far? Is it trending in line with those or is it any kind of similarity to that, that kind of shows yes, it is recovering and we should see it in x months or something like that?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, first of all, I'd be honest. As David said, I was surprised by the magnitude of the impact, considering it wasn't a real event. So if I look at that, I was very reluctant to look at past events because I thought this was very different. And I still think it's different. I think it's a different 1, because it's not real. It's also different because on the negative side because social different media is different today than it was historically. So I'll be honest, I don't have a good read for how this is going to play out, but I think studying in depth what happened -- we sort of look at that, I don't think the circumstances are the same.", "David Novak", "Yes, the circumstances aren't the same but the issue is consumers don't have to come. They can go to a lot of different places. So if you look at what's happened, our heavy user, they're extremely loyal. They love us, no issue. We've basically been able to basically keep our heavy user. But lighter users, they go to a lot of different places, they're heavy-user places. And so, that's the issue that you deal with and that's why, this bogus lawsuit was such an unfair thing to happen to Taco Bell. And our franchisees have been impacted by this significantly as have we. And so that's what we're dealing with and like I said earlier, we want to get out of the basement, out of the ditch and move forward. But we just don't know how long it's going to take us.", "Steve West", "Okay. Fair enough. I appreciate that.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Keith Seigler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just 1 quick question. You just hosted a bunch of us in California with Greg Creed talking about Taco Bell. You went through a number of strategic initiatives. Now that this is kind of -- the sales weakness is lingering maybe a little bit longer, does this change like the backwards integration into breakfast, does this change the remodel program timing, does it change any of the other things that we learned about? Like bigger picture, strategic initiatives for Taco Bell, does it postpone them? Anything along those lines?", "David Novak", "Better not. We're moving forward. We've got a great vision for Taco Bell. It's what we've talked about in the past, it's 70% of our U.S. profits. It's the second most profitable brand in the United States. We only have 5,000 units. We think we can have 8,000. We know we are long ways from that and we got to demonstrate that. We definitely believe we'll be in the Breakfast business. We definitely are in the process of remodeling, and we are very bullish on this business over the long term. We got the #1 value franchise in the business, outstanding food. And we got a cache even in spite of all this that will come back. I mean, and you go to the cocktail party and kids love Taco Bell. I mean, it's a talked about brand. And so we're extremely excited about the long-term. In this business, sometimes, you get hit with some things that you just don't anticipate. But you're absolutely right, we bounced back or whoever said that. When you've got great brands, they bounce back. There is a great history of that in our country and in the world. And if you're a great brand, you might have your hiccups but you'll come back. And this will -- we'll be waving the flag and charging the hill. But the team is focused on right now, obviously handing the short-term issue. It's unfortunate when you got to waste a bunch of your time dealing with lawyers when you should be focused 1,000% on the customer. We've had to do that. There's no question about it. But that's just a few people doing that. The real Taco Bell army is out there operating restaurants and doing the marketing. So we'll get there. And so, anyway.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Just a quick question on refranchising. Obviously, you all have some very strong comps in some of your markets, but I'm trying to understand the margin impact, if you could talk just maybe about the U.S. and also YRI. We saw last quarter some good benefits from portfolio management for your stores, and I would've thought we might see that again this quarter. I'm just trying to understand, can you give like an estimate in sort of basis points what kind of impact your franchising might be having until you lap some of these big sales of company-operated units?", "David Novak", "We sort of looked at it before. We thought it would  stay about a half-way benefit this year.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "For both the YRI and for the U.S.?", "David Novak", "It's definitely U.S., Sara. YRI is a little less than that.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "And then just another question on the YRI then. Can you help explain the sort of mix shift versus [indiscernible] because your food and paper costs were down, you have a very good margin expansion? What, was that all makeshift from 1 market to another or was there something else going on there?", "David Novak", "Are you talking about in the U.S. business?", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "No. YRI.", "David Novak", "Yes. The food cost, that is more of an impact of refranchising, just the shift in the businesses and there was -- it's just the difference in timing of inflation versus pricing put the lag on that.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Quick question, Rick. I just wanted to clarify your comments on the earnings outlook for 2011. And I was just curious to know if you can handicap the degree of difficulty you see now hitting your 10% plus EPS growth target, perhaps relative to what you would have thought entering the year. I know you have a lot of strength in China, but that's being offset by some other factors. So just if you could handicap the degree of difficulty you see now, that would be great.", "Richard Carucci", "Well, I would say the difficulty versus going into the year is it's harder. Obviously, China sales and profits in the first quarter were in the right direction. But clearly, the U.S. impact we had was the wrong direction. So I put those 2 together and put into together that we expect a relatively weaker second quarter than what we normally do. Then it's a little harder than it normally is.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.", "Andrew Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Just a quick follow up on sort of if you look at the margin picture for this year, I think you guys had kind of thought about commodities, having some risk in the back half of -- I think the number globally was another $40 million. Is that now baked into the new inflation assumptions? And then, how does -- what sounds like a bit of an increase from the beginning of the year and the focus on value and the marketing and promotional messages around the world kind of enter into the margin thought process as well?", "David Novak", "Well, regarding the cost piece of it, I'm not sure where the $40 million contact is. But let me repeat what we said and make sure that, that addresses your question. To your point, we did take up the commodity inflation in both the U.S. and China. So we're now at roughly 7% is our best guess in China and 6% in the U.S. So those numbers did go up from what we had at the beginning of the year. And I also just said on an earlier question that we probably only have now modest risk beyond those numbers. Does that answer your question?", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Yes, that's helpful.", "David Novak", "Okay. All right. Well, thank you all for being on the call. Let me just briefly wrap it up. Our China business is stronger than ever, and with 15% transaction growth this past quarter, we're well positioned for sustained growth ahead. Yum! Restaurants International had a solid quarter, and we expect strong performance for the balance of the year. Our U.S. business is indeed facing a challenging year, and we expect the second quarter to be our toughest and profits to dramatically improve in the second half of the year, however. Overall, we look for continued strength of our China YRI businesses to overcome a challenging year in the United States. We remain confident that 2011 will be the 10th consecutive year we achieved our annual target of at least 10% earnings per share growth.

Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thank you, Ashley. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.", "I would also like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements.

Wednesday, August 3, we will host a YRI, Yum! Restaurants International Investor Conference in Dallas, Texas. Thursday, September 8, we will host our China Investor Conference in Shanghai. Both of these events are close to being closed out in terms of the number of attendees, so please get to us quickly. Tuesday, October 4, third quarter earnings will be released. And finally, on our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. And now I'll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak", "Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report we raised our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12% from our initial guidance of at least 10%. We take satisfaction that 2011 will mark our 10th consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth. Our China business continues to deliver dynasty-like performance as our category leading brands just keep getting stronger. ", "Yum! Restaurants International continues to capitalize on explosive emerging-market growth and produced solid returns. And while we would normally be thrilled with this fantastic international performance, our obviously very disappointing year-to-date U.S. results have frankly taken some of the luster away from what otherwise would be a great year. It's time like these that make us appreciate the consistent EPS performance our global portfolio generates. ", "Our International business is clearly the growth engine that drives our company. Through the first half of this year, nearly 75% of our operating profit has come from China and Yum! Restaurants International. Our development pipeline is as strong as ever, and we continue to expect about 1,400 new units outside the United States this year. There is no question our China business is thriving and Yum! Restaurants International is producing solid gains. The good news is our International businesses are delivering these results while investing for strong growth ahead. We also expect U.S. performance to improve in the fourth quarter.", "Now let me take you through each of our businesses. Let's start with China, where our strategy is to build leading brands in every significant category. Based on our second quarter results, I think it's safe to say we are making it happen. Operating profit grew 25% prior to foreign currency translation benefit, as same-store sales jumped an impressive 18%. Combined with a 13% increase in units, system sales grew 28% for the quarter. Same-store transactions increased 21%. This exceptional increase in traffic gives us even more confidence that our category leading brands are stronger than ever and well positioned for sustained profitable growth ahead. ", "Our KFC China business is on a roll. Same-store sales grew 17% in the quarter and we continue to make good progress, growing average unit volumes with 24-hour operations, delivery service and building a solid breakfast business. We have breakfast in nearly all our KFCs in China, generating 13% of total transactions. We have delivery service in 1,600 restaurants, and 24-hour operations now on over 1,300 units. While there is tremendous excitement around these initiatives, we also know we're in the very early days. We are building a solid foundation for leveraging our assets, which will provide tremendous growth opportunities going forward for increased sales and even higher unit volumes.", "The new news is that we built upon the strength of our brands and are now providing even better everyday value, making our brands and competitive positions even stronger. We continued our RMB 6 breakfast, which is under $1, from the first quarter, and began offering a strong value option at lunch, including a RMB 15 offer for weekday lunch, which is a little over $2. These value initiatives are unique in the market as we can offer variety like vegetables, rice and soup as side dishes, in addition to popular KFC staples like the chicken Zinger burger. ", "We're extremely pleased that in an environment where the consumer is keenly aware of inflation, we continue to drive even more customers into our Chinese restaurants. Importantly, we continue to aggressively expand our KFC brand and we've opened 157 units in the first half of this year. We now have nearly 3,400 KFCs in China, and we're growing more than twice as fast as our nearest competitor.", "Now on to Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China is absolutely on fire. We had another fantastic quarter delivering 22% same-store sales growth. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. Leveraging an expanded-variety platform and a semiannual menu refresh, we continue to drive results. We have 544 restaurants in over 140 cities, and we opened 17 new locations in the second quarter. Pizza Hut is finding success as it expands deeper into lower-tier cities. It is the #1 western casual dining brand in China, and now in position to expand even more rapidly. Here again, our variety with everyday value has never been stronger, as we embrace our \"eat like a rich man, eat like a poor man\" strategy with compelling entr\u00e9e prices and half-off daily specials. ", "We also continue to make progress developing our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service now has 121 units in 11 cities and is generating steady margin improvement. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, has 21 units in 4 cities and continues to improve unit economics with the goal of developing into a successful national brand.", "In summary, our China business continues to be the top growth story, not only in our business, but in the entire restaurant category. Heads up to Sam Su and his world-class team who are clearly delivering dynasty-like performance at each of our brands.", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International, where our strategy is to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. Yum! Restaurants International produced solid results in the quarter, with system-sales growth of 6% and operating-profit growth of 11% prior to the benefit of foreign currency translation. Same-store sales increased 2% and restaurant margin improved 2 full percentage points. New-unit development is a key driver of growth for this business, and continued with 142 new units this quarter. Nearly 90% of these units were opened by our strong network of franchisees, and we expect to open about 900 new units at Yum! Restaurants International for the full year. ", "We continue to produce strong results in emerging markets. System sales in emerging markets grew 11% in the quarter. We also opened 72 new units in the emerging world and remained very focused on developing these high-growth markets. Yum! Restaurants International now has over 6,400 restaurants across 67 emerging-market countries, a level that is unmatched by competitors. We continue to make progress in Russia and India, and expand our brands throughout the rest of Asia and into the African continent. ", "We're also excited about our opportunities in developed markets. I recently returned from France and the U.K. and came away very excited about our opportunities there. In France, our KFC business performance has really accelerated. We've seen strong same-store sales growth this year and now have restaurant margins in the mid-teens. Ivan Schofield, our French GM, focused on streamlining operations through simplified menus and disciplined cost management, as well as breakthrough innovation around sandwiches.", "Increased scale in France has allowed for more television advertising, and we expect to advertise on national TV 17 weeks this year versus 7 weeks that we had in 2010. We have ambitious franchisees who want to develop the brand, and we expect to open 18 new restaurants this year, taking our total to over 130 restaurants. Remember, McDonald's makes more money in France alone than all of Yum! Restaurants International with almost 1,200 restaurants. That's why we are so excited that our KFC France business has the highest average unit sales and makes more absolute profit per store than anywhere else in the world. We intend to make a lot of money in France.", "With over 700 units, our KFC business in the U.K. has been one of our most consistent performers in Yum! Restaurants International. We have put together 21 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth with solid operations, new product innovation and vibrant assets. The KFC team was also recently recognized as one of the top 50 places to work in the U.K. So congratulations to Martin Shuker, our KFC GM, for delivering these great results. ", "Now, as you know if you followed our company, our Pizza Hut U.K. business has been soft, but the team is expecting a stronger second half with the launch of free salads and new individual pizzas, combined with a casual-dining operating focus. The good news is, is that we have very -- our very early results are encouraging. Our goal is to turn this business around and reinstate our re-franchising program. ", "I was also in Vancouver in May for our Yum! Restaurants International franchise convention, and I can tell you that our franchisees around the world are extremely excited about the strength of our brands globally and the growth opportunities we've identified for the future.", "In summary, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track and delivering solid results. We're pleased with the progress we're making with same-store sales growth and restaurant margins. Longer term, we expect our category-leading position in emerging markets to fuel continued strong growth. I'll be busy in Russia and Germany in the next couple of months, and I look forward to giving you an update on these 2 exciting opportunities as well.", "As I made very clear on our April call, we would have an extremely challenging second quarter in the United States, and we certainly did. Same-store sales fell 4% and operating profit dropped 28%. Now this is primarily due to Taco Bell, our most profitable U.S. brand, which had a same-store sales decline of 5% in the quarter. We also had higher-than-normal commodity inflation.", "As indicated on our first quarter call, the second quarter performance in the U.S. would be our low point of the year. But looking back, we under-called just how disappointing it would be. At the time of our first quarter call, I thought we would be positive at Taco Bell by now, and we're not. Our light user has been surprisingly difficult to bring back after the negative publicity surrounding the meritless lawsuit from earlier in this year. The remainder of 2011 will be challenging from a sales standpoint, but we expect slow improvement from the low point in the second quarter.", "Looking to 2012, we believe Taco Bell has significant category innovation in the pipeline that will re-energize the brand. Fortunately and unfortunately, we will have the benefit of overlapping this extremely weak performance next year. Our goal now is to stabilize the business and get back on a growth track, and we're confident we will do so. We remain bullish about the long-term prospects for the Taco Bell brand and are determined to turn around these unacceptable results. Believe me, all hands are on deck. ", "So let me wrap this up. Our Yum! portfolio is delivering, and all things considered, we're pleased to raise our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12%. We're confident the strength of our International business will make 2011 the 10th consecutive year we achieve our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth.", "Now let me turn it over to Rick to take you through more of the details.", "Richard Carucci", "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to provide some commentary and give some context to 3 areas: our second quarter results, headwinds and tailwinds for the balance of the year, and the implication of this year's results on our business model. ", "In my first quarter remarks, I said Yum!'s results were a tale of 2 cities. Well, our second quarter was still a tale of 2 cities, only amplified. As David described, we had simply outstanding results in China, while U.S. performance was poor. Yum! Restaurants International performance was solid, and we also benefited from a lower tax rate than last year. When you add it all up, EPS growth totaled 13% excluding special items.", "China produced simply an outstanding quarter with 25% operating-profit growth fueled -- prior to foreign currency translation. System sales increased an impressive 28%, driven by new-unit development of 13% and same-store sales growth of 18%. The strong sales and transaction growth helped offset most of the cost pressures, as margins decreased by 0.5 point versus prior year, but remained quite healthy. ", "Our YRI business had another very solid quarter, with operating profit growth of 11% prior to foreign currency translation. Sales growth was enhanced by our performance in emerging markets, where system sales grew 11%. Overall, restaurant margins improved by 2 full percentage points and are now 12.7%. ", "Margins benefited from the strong performance in France and Thailand. Additionally, the portfolio actions we took last year, including the re-franchising of our Mexico business and the acquisition of our Russian business, also benefit margins.", "Pizza Hut in the U.K. remained our biggest challenge at YRI. However, we are cautiously optimistic that our results will improve, as we are in the early days of our brand relaunch there. ", "Our U.S. business had a very disappointing quarter, and was a significant drain on our earnings. While we'd previously communicated the second quarter would be challenging and the low point of the year for our U.S. business, believe me, a 28% decline in operating profit is still disappointing. Transactions fell 8% in the quarter. Commodity inflation was $15 million and self-insurance costs were $11 million higher than last year, related to an unfavorable overlap in the second quarter of 2010.", "Even though each brand took menu pricing actions to offset commodity inflation, the flow-through was less than normal due to menu mix shift towards higher-cost items. Overall, U.S. margins dropped 4.4 percentage points in the quarter. ", "Finally, overall for Yum! in the second quarter, we had a huge lift from ForEx and tax. The foreign currency translation from China and YRI provided a $19 million benefit. Our effective tax rate fell to 16.7%, which was 7 points below last year's level and provided a significant benefit to our second quarter EPS results. ", "Now I'm going to shift gears and talk about headwinds and tailwinds for the balance of the year. In China, we head into the rest of the year with great across-the-board sales momentum, and it's also nice to see that the economy is growing at such a healthy pace. We therefore expect double-digit same-store sales growth to continue in the third quarter. Development also continues to be robust and we're on track to open at least 500 new units this year across all tier cities. Our new unit performance remains very strong, and we continue to generate cash paybacks of about 3 years.", "As we noted previously, we do expect cost and profit challenges in the back half of the year in China. Our commodity inflation forecast is now 9% for the full year, including 11% in the second half. We will also be overlapping a $15 million profit benefit from our participation in the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. This event improved sales, profits and restaurant margins, primarily in the third quarter last year. ", "A new business tax implemented late last year has about a 0.5 point negative impact on margin throughout the year. Labor inflation is also a current year margin headwind, as we expect full year labor inflation in the mid to high teens.", "After considering all of these factors, we believe our full year restaurant margins will likely come in below last year's level. However, we do have confidence our margins will remain very healthy, and we currently expect full year margins of over 20%.", "From a longer-term perspective, the statistic that impresses us a lot is the middle-class growth in China. The consuming class is expected to expand by anywhere from 200 million people to 500 million people over the next 10 years, depending on the source you look at. Whichever number you use, it's a big number and a lot of people. As the middle class grows, more people have resources to purchase our food and become loyal Yum! customers.", "We also expect our China 2011 results to continue to benefit from ForEx. Our current year full year estimate of ForEx is $40 million, including about $25 million in the second half. Overall, we remain bullish on our profit growth expectations in China for this year and well into the future. ", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we are focused -- we are forecasting 900 new units this year and almost 500 net units. Because new-unit development drives a significant portion of this division's profit growth, this will aid our growth rates both in 2011 and 2012.", "From a profit perspective for the third quarter, we'll have a headwind of $4 million or about 3 points of profit growth, driven by the expense of our biannual franchise comp that David mentioned. Additionally, ForEx also has a big benefit to YRI. At this point, we expect full year foreign currency benefit of $40 million at YRI, including about $25 million in the second half. ", "Finally, as David said, the U.S. business will likely continue to be a challenge for us. Given the current trends, we expect to see a decrease in sales as low as a double-digit profit decline when we post our third quarter results. Fortunately, we'd be overlapping high G&A costs from the fourth quarter of last year. This should help stabilize U.S. operating profits considerably when we get to the fourth quarter.", "Now let's turn to our business model. Our Q2 results and balance-of-year outlook demonstrate that our business model is evolving faster than planned. Not long ago, we projected 75% of our operating profit would come from China and YRI by 2015. As of the second quarter of this year, we're nearly there already. Admittedly, we didn't get to this point the way we wanted to as the U.S. profit decline drove some of the shift. However, having more of our profit generated in the high-growth businesses makes our growth prospects stronger going forward. ", "Our exposure to emerging markets continues to rise dramatically. In 2000, about 10% of our operating profit came from the emerging world. This year, we expect over 50% to come from emerging markets, and we expect that percentage to increase over time. Let me use Russia and India as a small example. Currently, about 2% of sales for our Yum! Restaurants International business comes from the these 2 countries. By our estimate, McDonald's makes about $300 million in Russia alone, and we are just beginning to make a profit in these 2 countries. For the second quarter, Russia had system-sales growth of 19%, and India had system-sales growth of 44%, excluding foreign currency. As this shows, we are in the ground floor of growth in these emerging markets and we're making huge gains in growing our businesses.", "In summary, we believe that 2011 again demonstrates the power of the Yum! portfolio. We raised our guidance to 12% full year EPS growth despite a very soft year in the U.S. The Yum! growth equation is not only strong, but is gaining strength. With our combined strength in emerging markets, we believe we are well positioned for growth for many years to come.", "Back to you, David.", "David Novak", "Okay, thank you very much, Rick, and we look forward to taking any questions you have about the quarter or our business. So...", "Tim Jerzyk", "We're ready for questions, Ashley.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "A couple of questions. Just first on China, these value layers that you're introducing, first breakfast and now lunch, do you view these as -- are these permanent, new introductions to layers in the business? In other words, are these akin to kind of what we have, a dollar menu in the U.S.? Or are these more limited time-in nature? And can you just talk about, with the net holding commodity inflation aside, has there been a net negative margin impact from this? And when you think about margins long term, is there a change to your view on that, given the new composition of sales and traffic?", "Richard Carucci", "Well, let me take the first crack at that and then David may want to add a few things. First of all, when I say the theme of the initiatives on the KFC side would be more daypart-oriented. So, for example, David mentioned we have a RMB 6 value at breakfast. We also have a RMB 6 snacking offer in the afternoon. And then we also had the lunch offer he talked about. So we're trying to be -- give the right value offering to the right daypart, versus across-the-board product value offerings. We think that's a more profitable way of attacking value. So my sense or belief is we'll always have value initiatives, but we'll change them from time to time. But probably, the theme of values for different dayparts will stay there for a while. Regarding in terms of the impact on profitability in margins, first of all, a lot of these current value initiatives really drove incremental traffic. Breakfast transactions now make up, I think, 13% of transactions in the quarter, which is well up from what it had been previously. So we're definitely getting some incremental growth from it. And you saw the transaction growth that we posted. So the good news is, in these offerings, a lot of them were incremental. In terms of the overall margins, again, there's obviously a lot of moving parts there. And then we took modest pricing at the end of January, and you see that the combination between that and these targeted value initiatives really work from an overall P&L perspective. So we're very comfortable with our longer-term margins in China.", "David Novak", "Yes, I think that the big thing with KFC is we're focused on building all the big components that build your image, build the big brand and take us in the future. We basically lead our competitors across every major dimension you could look from a brand-building perspective. The one thing that we believe is very strategic for us is just to make our brands very affordable on an ongoing, everyday basis. And because as Rick mentioned in his speech, depending on the survey that you're looking at, you got the consuming class going from 200 million to 500 million, so we have a lot of people who will be coming into the marketplace. So everyday affordability and access is really the name and the game, and the China team has found a very successful way to do that by focusing on the dayparts, as Rick pointed out. So I think what -- when you can have the leading brand and competitive pricing, it gives you a pretty unassailable position in the marketplace. So we have up to 3 value items at each of our dayparts to really leverage our asset throughout the day.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "And if I could just, unrelated, make -- I just have one unrelated follow-up. On Taco Bell, is there any sign yet that, that business actually has stabilized? I think last quarter you commented that it hadn't. To note, I just wondered if the 5% represents a stabilization? And then I understand your view on how maybe the incidents earlier in the year may have set off a chain reaction of sort of the light user abandoning the concept. But is there any evidence that -- throughout your 3 brands you had negative same-store sales -- that really it's the QSR consumer now that's maybe finally reacting, or is reacting at an accelerated rate to the economy? Is there any -- how much of it is macro underlying? And it would seem to me that that's probably the bigger issue, but I don't know if you have any specific insights on how much of it is just the change in what the consumer behavior is versus maybe a brand specific issue.", "Richard Carucci", "Why don't I just talk about what we said about sales, and I'll hand it to David to talk about the brand going forward. What we said about sales is -- again, you saw the number, minus 5% in the second quarter. We said that would be the low point of the year. We haven't seen a turnaround. So I've also said that total U.S. would be negative in the third quarter. You could read that into there for Taco Bell will be negative in the third quarter, but not as bad as the 5%. David also said in his speech, he sort of expects sales to get better when we -- or hopefully dramatically better when we launch a product, which is right to our target towards the end of the first quarter next year. With that, I'll let David talk about what he sees with the brand.", "David Novak", "I think to put the Taco Bell brand into perspective here, I mean there's no question when we just look at our overall research that Taco Bell remains an extremely strong brand. We all know it's the second most profitable brand in our category. It continues to have the #1 value image. It's highly charismatic. It's highly differentiated with no national competitor. And as you recall, we did start the year out fairly strong and then we took a big hit with a bogus lawsuit on our meat quality. And what we found in this economic environment -- macro-environment, was that our heavy users really stuck with us, but we did lose, as I mentioned earlier, frequency with our light users. So we still have a challenge getting our light user back in the fold. And frankly, the negative sales that resulted from the lawsuit has lasted longer than anyone of us thought it would. Even though when we look at -- historically at food quality-related issues in our industry, it takes about 6 months to get a full recovery. I think all of this, to your point about the macros, is exacerbated by the fact that when you look at Taco Bell, our unemployment of our primary target audience of 18- to 24-year-olds is about 17%, and you've got high gas prices. And I think these 2 factors is making it harder for us to recover. One of the things I take a lot of pride in on our company is we don't really like storytelling. Stories equal excuses. I mean, as far as we're concerned, the meat issue is over, okay? The economy is something we have to deal with and we just need to be doing a better job building this brand going forward, and that's what we're really focused on. Right now we're in the midst of trying to deal with the macroeconomic environment by focusing on a Spend Less Summer at Taco Bell. We've got product news coming in, in the balance of the year. We're working hard to make our advertising more insight-driven and more compelling, while we continue to focus on building our operating capability, which the good news is getting better and better. So I think we clearly have a short-term issue here we've got to address. We are all over it and we're going to stay all over it. You'd mentioned our other U.S. brands. I think when we look at Pizza Hut, we actually feel fairly good about the Pizza Hut performance because remember, we had a tremendous turnaround in sales last year with our value program. We've retained our value positioning and, by and large, most of the sales, so we really haven't had a boom splat. We've got innovation and more value coming as we go into the balance of the year. So we think Taco Bell is -- I mean Pizza Hut's in pretty good shape in the U.S. And in fact, this will be the first year that we're going to have net new-unit development in Pizza Hut because we've made a lot of progress and we've got some things in the work that are exciting there. KFC continues to be a difficult challenge for us in the U.S. We are focused on turning this business around. We just relaunched our Kentucky Grilled Chicken. We're optimistic about that product continuing to build the brand in. We've got a multiyear challenge here, as we talked about, in terms of improving our assets and our operations. But the big driver of U.S. profitability is Taco Bell, as we pointed out. That is priority #1, and we're all over it. We've got a great team committed to building the business and we will get this business turned around again. As Rick mentioned, we've got some significant innovation that we think is going to be breakthrough as we celebrate our 50th anniversary in 2012, so we have that coming. And we've got a lot of things in the works. But this year for Taco Bell is going to be disappointing, below our expectations. And we're going to stabilize it. That's the goal, and then build from that point. One thing about this is that we will have the benefit of overlapping these unacceptable results.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "First, just a question on the tax rate. Was it unusually low for any like specific onetime reason? Or did the earnings mix shifting to International have a role on that? And what are you expecting for the full year tax rate just roughly?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, I mean, what we said Joe, I guess, starting 1.5 years ago is we said over a 3-year period, 2010, '11 and '12, that we'd have a tax rate of about 26%. We said there could be annual and quarterly volatility there. Last year came in, in that range, a little over 25%. So we expect to be in the range of that, and that's what's built into our guidance. In terms of the low rate in the second quarter, the second quarter historically is a seasonally low quarter. It is the time at which certain taxes with authorities get reconciled. And so the way the tax rules work, that frequently will deliver a lowest -- lower rate. So actually if you go back in time, the quarterly rate last year was higher than normal. This type of rate is not atypical to what we've gotten over the last 3 years.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then a question again on China from a pricing value trade-off or balance. As that food inflation forecast goes higher, do you expect to take more price? And if you do so, how do you balance that with still featuring value?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, just to remind people with where we are there, you obviously have to keep balancing the value with the transaction driving that David talked about. We ended up -- well, if you do the math, Joe, that we had -- we sort of said we'd have commodity inflation in the 9% level for the first year. We said mid to upper teens for labor. If you take those growth rates on top of what proportion of the P&L they represent, it's basically about a 5.5-point piece that you have to make up somewhere. We took pricing in the 2 to 3 range, probably like -- more like the 3 range at the end of January, the same time we put in these initiatives. So all things being equal, that would be the gap that you'd need to come over. However, we've had such a strong response to our initiatives and just the market being strong that we are getting some leverage on -- through our transaction growth on the fixed part of our P&L. So we're able to make the numbers work right now. Obviously, if we continue to get inflation, at some point you have to look at pricing, but we're not planning on doing anything in the very near term.", "David Novak", "I think the other thing, Joe, is that when you look at these value items it's around 10% of our mix, so we think we have a great balance of our menu in terms of what's on the low end and what's higher-priced items. So we think we're managing that well, and we will continue to do that. And I think, as we all know, the stronger your brands are, the more flexibility you do have in the marketplace as it comes to managing your pricing.", "Joseph Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just one more on the China value. So are these items new items that have been introduced specifically for the value offering? Or were they existing menu items you marked down in price?", "Richard Carucci", "It's a combination.", "David Novak", "Yes, it's both.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "I have a question on U.S. and Taco Bell. You mentioned that there's some innovation coming in 2012. I'm just curious, do you believe that there's anything proactive that Yum! and Taco Bell particularly can do to repair that brand this year, to make sure you get back to growth in 2012? Or is this something that your instincts and research tell you that you're going to throw money at it and these light users really don't want to hear it, and it's going to be really the time that repairs this brand and gets you the benefit of those comparisons in 2012, and the messaging is probably a waste of money at this point?", "David Novak", "I think that -- first of all, I think we need time, okay? There's no question that we've impacted it. So there will be some benefit that only time can provide. But the minute we say we're going to wait to figure out how to grow this business is the minute somebody needs to get rid of me and everybody else that's in the company. So we're going to work as hard as we can to get the business turned around. We're not going to throw good money after bad. But we think we have a great brand, lots of things that we can do to stabilize the business, and we're very confident that we can get the brand stabilized, ready to go and have the benefit of overlap in the weak performance next year. So we definitely think there are things we can do.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank", "And one quick one on Pizza Hut U.K. You have a new menu going out there right around now. Maybe you can give an update about that. Is it too early to tell how that is doing or will do? Could that be something that helps the second half for YRI?", "Richard Carucci", "Well, the early results are, as I sort of said, are encouraging. There's a lot of noise in the results because we're overlapping a particularly weak part last year, so we want it to settle down a little bit before we sort of talk about performance. We think it's the right direction from a brand perspective. The freestyle has gotten a lot of publicity, modernizes the brand. So there's a lot of buzz around the brand right now, which had been lacking there. So as I said, so cautiously optimistic. What we'll also hopefully do is if you look at the -- we talked about the margin performance at YRI, which took a good turn for the better. And we did that despite a drag on Pizza Hut U.K. So what I'm hoping, at least from a profit standpoint, is it will stop being a drag on our margins for the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk.", "Howard Penney - Prudential Equity Group", "In the past, McDonald's has been able to take some of the lessons learned in some regions of the world and apply it to other parts of the world that are underperforming. Is this -- is there something structural about the business at KFC and Taco Bell that you can apply the lessons learned in China and other parts of the world and apply that to the U.S. to help performance?", "David Novak", "I think that -- Howard, first of all, I think that's a good point, and it's a good challenge. And one of the things that we're very focused on in our company is sharing know-how and the lessons learned, and building capability just through leverage and the scale of all the resource and experiences that we do have around the world. I think that what you got with KFC outside of the United States is a much more dynamic, big-box format that is much more akin to McDonald's. And I think there's just been a lot more innovation and breadth built into the menu in KFC in most countries outside the United States, because I think Colonel Sanders kind of set the U.S. up with a heritage of small-box chicken on the bone, stay focused on your knitting. And so I do think that it's a little harder for us to transform the brand, or it's a lot harder for us to transform the brand into a multi-variety, multi-daypart brand that we have in -- especially in the emerging markets. So there is a structural issue there. And frankly, we don't have a franchise system that is as enlightened as our franchisees are outside the United States as well. So that's something that we have to deal with as well. I think as far as Taco Bell goes, Taco Bell is a great brand. We're taking a hit at this point in time. I wouldn't trade Taco Bell for any other U.S. brand. I mean, this is a fantastic brand and we're going to grow it. We know that this business is built on great operations. And one of the things that Taco Bell has done over time -- if you look at the majors, it's improved its operations dramatically. We're in the top tier in both accuracy and speed on drive-thru. We're continuing to focus on the operations, and it's driven by innovation and news. And we think that our pipeline at Taco Bell -- while we've been working on things, we haven't had a big news item in quite a while. We've got some things in test market that we're very excited about and encouraged about, but we think that, that end of the innovation that drives the rest of our world can certainly work at Taco Bell as well, and we've got some coming. So I think we understand the business. We share the knowledge that we have. We're getting there, but there are some structural differences with KFC, but there certainly isn't anything that's holding us back at Taco Bell.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I wanted to ask you about the China business and the value strategy. I guess I'm curious, would you say there's maybe a risk at all that, when you start driving the business on value, that it opens you up? That someone else could come along and offer maybe a marginally better value, you start competing on a metric that's not own-able. And then again even against yourselves, next year you're being -- you'd be forced to offer a better value than you did this year. Is there any sort of risk that maybe you're taking and driving traffic in this way? Or do you think that's not something that we should be concerned about?", "David Novak", "Yes, I think it would be a real disservice to what's going on right now in China to describe our strategy as a value strategy, okay? I think our strategy -- well , I know our strategy is a brand-building strategy and an asset-leverage-building strategy. So what we're really trying to do is just make our brand as compelling and as relevant and as ubiquitous as you possibly can make it. And if you look at the real success factors in this category, you have a broad menu, you leverage your asset throughout the day, and you make your products affordable on an everyday basis. Now we're doing this, and we're doing it with great margins. And what we're not doing, though, is executing a value strategy that's going to force us to get lower and lower and lower, and getting into this downward spiral where we're not going to make any money. I think if there's one thing that we know how to do in China -- I think it's our biggest strength by far and away -- is we have a great team of people who know how to build a brand. These people are brand-builders, and they're doing a fantastic job doing it. We have operational excellence that is, I think, the best certainly within Yum!, and maybe in all of retail in China. And we're building the brand. And anybody that knows our category knows that part of that is making your products affordable. And that's what we're doing and we're very excited about that. But meanwhile, we've got category-leading advertising, we've got category-leading variety, we've got daypart extension and leverage, and then we've got to go with the value. So it's part of the overall package.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "All right. That's helpful clarification. And the other thing I wanted to ask is again about the U.S. And I guess it sounds like for Taco Bell, you have some new product news coming. But other than that, I don't know, it sounds I guess less like there's anything specific in place now, that there's some work that needs to be done. What's -- I guess, could you be any more specific about strategy and what's going to turn the business around, not just for Taco Bell, but all 3 were negative. And so could you be any more specific? Or is it something that's just not -- you're not comfortable talking about in this forum?", "David Novak", "No, I'm totally comfortable about talking about the business and the brand in this forum and any forum. I just did, basically. I think that what we have, #1 value image in the category and a taste that people love, okay? It's different. We have different taste at incredible amount of value. And so that's our strategy. We want to keep driving home the unique taste that we have at Taco Bell and the incredible value, and we will do that. We have, I think -- at the balance of the year, we have some product news, but it's not like earth-shattering product news, okay? It's more of the blocking and tackling that we do at Taco Bell. Now we do have some things in test market that we're very excited about, that we do think are category innovations and a significant breakthrough coming for 2012, but I think we're going to have to just do a better job of doing -- operating our business on a day-to-day basis, and then doing as compelling as we can, marketing around what we stand for while we get the gift of time that will allow us to get through this beef issue that we have.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Just wanted to ask a few questions on the financial model for 2011. First, Rick, could you clarify what tax rate you're assuming for the second half of the year?", "Richard Carucci", "Well, we said sort of a full year rate in that 26 -- 25%, 26% range.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, great. I just wanted to clarify that. And then I guess when you take a step back and look at the guidance that you're giving, you increased it after fairly modest operating-profit growth in the first half. I just was wondering if you could give color on why -- what are the factors that led to the guidance increase after the first half results. Is it more optimism about the second half in the international businesses? Or perhaps if you could clarify, that'd be great.", "Richard Carucci", "Well, I'd say it's a few things. First of all, keep in mind the way our business model works is we usually -- our math gets us to a number higher than 10. We say at least 10, but usually it's -- look at how our model plays out. That's how we've been able to do 13%-plus historically. In terms of why we took it up at this point, there's really, I think, 2 driving factors. One is China performance that we talked about. The second is ForEx is a huge tailwind for us, the full year number in the $80 million range. And a lot of that we're quite confident about, because we had a fairly large amount year-to-date and the balance of the China year for us, we're extremely confident about. So that -- if you combine those things, that gives us a positive -- we mentioned in the fourth quarter, we expect better results. We had sort of higher-than-usual expenses in some items there that we identified at that point in last year that we feel pretty good about our fourth quarter overlap as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Wells Fargo.", "Jeffrey Omohundro - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "Beyond pricing and check initiatives, though, could you update us on other avenues to manage some of this margin pressure in China that you might be pursuing? And I'm thinking perhaps areas such as labor scheduling or supply-chain improvements and so forth.", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, I mean, the team there just does an excellent job. David talked about great operations, and the team -- you should take that in a very broad sense. I mean the team does first-rate jobs in all those areas related to that, the setting up of their backup house system, their purchasing. We own our distribution system there. So that team is always focused on delivering innovation and productivity through the line. So we don't have any special, blow-away productivity initiatives in place. We just continue to do the day-to-day cost management throughout the P&L.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rachael Rothman with Susquehanna.", "Jake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "This is Jake Bartlett in for Rachael. I was hoping you can dig a little deeper into the labor inflation in China. By my math, it looks like average store labor increased about 30% in the quarter. It was up from about 22% in the first quarter. Just wondering how that squares with the double-digit -- or the kind of mid-teens labor inflation you talked about? Anything else going on there? Any sort of preparation for future growth? Anything that's kind of affecting the labor per store.", "Richard Carucci", "I have to go back and double-check the math, but I assume it's mostly driven by labor rate and the volume increases.", "Jake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "This is -- so -- but I'm just looking at 18% same-store sales and de-leveraging of 150 basis points. And just kind of looking at that math, it looks like you had, I guess, 25% to 30% kind of growth in labor per sales unit.", "Tim Jerzyk", "If you look at the components, as Rick said, basically, we're experiencing 15% and 20% wage-rate inflation, and you had a 21% increase in transactions. So you got to look at both of those combined to get to the per-store labor cost. Those are the base factors. There's really nothing else that's going through that.", "Jake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay, and then a clarification on COGS in China. Can you give us -- for the year you're increasing the inflation from 7% to 9%. Can you tell us what it was in the first and second quarter? I know on what you're expecting, about 11% in the back half. Just wondering the kind of pace there.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, we'll get it for you. do you have another question, while we're...", "Richard Carucci", "It was in about the 6% range in the first half of the year.", "Jake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay, so -- but in the second quarter I'd assumed it maturely -- 6% for the first half, okay.", "Richard Carucci", "And the second quarter. The second quarter and the first half were 6%.", "Jake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "They're both 6%, okay. The last question is just on YRI. You're getting -- I understand you're getting a benefit from mix shift with the re-franchising in YRI. But just looking at COGS line, it looks like you're getting pretty decent leverage there. I'm just wondering how that's working. Maybe you can give us an idea of the commodity inflation that you saw in YRI in the first and the second quarter, and just kind of what's driving expansion there or kind of leverage on COGS.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Commodity inflation in YRI is much lower than we are experiencing in China and U.S. It's low single digit. The big driver of the year-over-year change there is more of a portfolio factor. The Thailand business has been very strong and that's driving lower cost of sales. You've got to keep in mind, YRI is a big portfolio of different company businesses.", "Jake Bartlett - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Okay. And then last question. Last quarter, you gave us an inflation target in the U.S. of, I think, what, 6%? If you could give us an update in the U.S., that'd be great as well.", "Tim Jerzyk", "7%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes, just wanted to go back to the China strength again, and just wanted to get you guys' thoughts on how the comps have progressed this year. And I know you talked a lot about the value initiatives and other things going on there, but were you surprised at the strength you've seen? I'm assuming you were. And can you talk about how significant the value changes were versus what you've been doing in the past? And how much of this was maybe macro-driven as well? And if you just could give a little more color as to sort of how this thing has played out, which has been pretty impressive.", "Richard Carucci", "We don't have great industry information on a real-time basis, so we don't know. We could only assume that we're above -- significantly above the market, which when you're the leader above the market you feel good about. We saw that McDonald's sort of posted at about double digits for the time that they talked about, but on the lower end of double digits. We were obviously at the higher end. So it's hard for us to put exactly how much is the economy versus us. But I'd sort of say clearly by 2/3 of it, so the economy, the rest of it has this big, big amount given the size that we've got. And of that, I think that the 2 biggest pieces, one David talked about in his presentation. But reminder, the daypart initiatives, things like KFC delivery, breakfast, 24-hour, those probably add about 4 points of growth by themselves. So you have that plus the economy and so the rest of it, I'd say, would be the other initiatives that we've taken.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Omar Sayeed [ph] with Song Asset Management [ph].", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I just wanted to see where the acquisition with Little Sheep stands from an execution perspective. And I was also wondering about the plans for the brand inside and outside of China, and what we should model in, in terms of estimated synergies or EPS impact.", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, we're not ready to discuss that because we thought that the 2 hurdles we discussed last time -- the 2 hurdles that we still have to go through is government approval in China and shareholder approval in Hong Kong. And so neither one of those is done yet. I do expect we'd have an answer on both when we report this time next quarter.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. Is everything going according to plan on those?", "Richard Carucci", "You can't really have a plan. This is the government, so we don't know until they answer. And you can't know the shareholders until they vote.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "In China, can you give us any sense of what you might think food costs are looking like in 2012, and perhaps what the buzz is on wage-rate inflation in 2012? And also in China, on East Dawning, it seems like you're at about 20 units, put up 1 this year. I think you've closed a couple last year. Can you talk about that process of improving unit economics? It seems like you may have slowed things down a bit. Are there any particular constraints to get East Dawning growing more aggressively?", "Richard Carucci", "The first part of the question, we really don't have great visibility into commodities by next year in China, so we probably won't until fairly late this year. We don't buy as far out there as we do in some other markets. Regarding the labor inflation, we expect it just still be high, but probably not this high. That would be my guess. We sort of used to run in the high single digits. So I think going forward, it's probably going to run in the low double digits would be my best guess at this point. On East Dawning, in terms of the economic model, we continue to make good progress with the consumer. We still have a long way to go before we believe it's ready for rapid expansion, but we also feel good about, as we've developed the combination of what we prepare in restaurant and what we prepare in the commissary. And so we're actually probably going to try that concept in a few of the cities near where we have commissary, but not in the city proper, and see how that goes. But just don't count on anything dramatic in the next year or so.", "Mitchell Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "And if I could slip just one more in on the U.S, can you give us a sense of how the category is doing and overall QSR and if you have seen an overall category slowdown?", "Richard Carucci", "Well, the economy is not doing great, so you sort of see the general outlines, and I'd say that's sort of similar to what we see in the categories. You sort of see some sort of good weeks and bad weeks and good months and not-so-good months. But frankly, we know we're underperforming the category, and David sort of just spelled that out in his comments. So we know it's tough out there, but we also know we need to do better.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Two questions, first about China and the second about YRI. The one about China is going to sound probably a little silly or even very premature, but people are talking about the potential for interest rates to slow down the economy. Presumably, that would also pull down inflation. Can you just talk a little bit about the cadence of if there were -- if there was a slowdown, would you be locked into prices first and have some wage pressure first maybe if your comps decelerated -- or rather margin pressure if your comps decelerated, and then maybe you could catch up? Or do you think we'd see that adjustment in your costs kind of happen simultaneously, such that -- if you look back at '09, you had slowing comps buy really good profit dollar growth. And then I'll have a follow-up question.", "Richard Carucci", "I'll deal with the first one. But if you look at the -- first, the economic growth and then inflation. I think, clearly, the government there is trying to balance those 2 things as best as they can. Economic growth right now, we see it picking up. I'm not sure what's going to happen in the next few years, but we feel it strengthens during the course of this year. And what we said before, it's the trends for retail I still feel very bullish about, and that is that they continue to invest in infrastructure, which obviously is this new trade zone. People keep moving from country to city as they create new cities. We're adding about 65 cities a year for KFCs. And we talked about the middle-class growth, which is huge. So for us, all those things are why we're still bullish about the future in China, but we do acknowledge to your point that there's going to be bumps from an economic perspective on that growth, as the government and whoever's running that China balance growth with inflation. In terms of inflation itself, it's hard to predict what'll happen when. As we sort of said before, I don't fear an inflation scenario, because when we have all the dayparts we talked about, we believe we have more leverage to pull than most people. We do a really good job on distribution in those areas of the business, so we feel we could handle that just about better than anyone without trying to sound cocky. So we actually don't fear inflations. The team will figure out the right pacing and sequencing of how you handle pricing in that scenario. I personally am still -- I've sort of said this before. I'm not convinced that commodities -- I do believe that labor inflation will continue high for quite a while. I think commodities are more of a wildcard in that they can move in both directions over the next several years.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Great. And then just on the YRI question, I think based on when you break out emerging versus developed markets, system-wide sales growth in emerging of 11%, I think you said, and unit growth in 5%, so that implies unit volumes at 6%. Is that sort of a comp you're running? Is that a mix number you're talking about? And then 6% or mid-single digits is the comp, that seems pretty good, but kind of in line with emerging market inflation. So are there areas where you have specific strength or weakness?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, I can't tell you offhand, because there's a lot of countries involved, how much would be mix in that equation. We'll have to go back and check on that. Again, in emerging markets, it depends which ones. But for us, the big emerging markets -- I don't want to discount the question, but our real focus is on developing the brand and unit economics that allow expansion. We talk about how many restaurants we have per million people, and the number in India is like 0.2 versus 3 in China and versus 60 in the US. So that's really -- at least the way we look at it, our real focus is build the brand, build the unit economics with that, that allow you to expand. And overall, we feel pretty good about those things. And you saw overall our system-sales growth are very strong, and clearly, there's seems pretty good same-store sales growth in there. So I think, actually, we're doing a pretty good job on both of those areas in emerging markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Sorry, just a couple quick questions. With YRI, it was pretty clear in the release that Japan definitely had a somewhat meaningful impact on both comps and system sales as it explains in the footnotes, and what I was wondering is, since that was March, April and May for Japan, have you seen an improvement off the bottom? Did the trends get better inter-quarter? And what do you think about Japan drag on those numbers for next quarter?", "Richard Carucci", "It was about a 0.5 point on the past quarter. Things are getting a bit better there.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay. And then just a bigger kind of broader question. So the business model shifted very quickly to the mix of international and U.S. 2015 becomes end of 2011 pretty quickly in this scenario. You've got less cash coming from the U.S. When you think about funding like share repurchase programs and dividends and growth in those, and as you get continued growth in China, how do you think about bringing the cash back to the U.S.? And what are the repatriation issues, if any? What's going to change now that you need to bring more cash back to the U.S. to fund those programs?", "Richard Carucci", "Well, we've been planning this for a while and it's also happened gradually. So even though we have a big shift this year that's, to be honest, isn't that big an issue to us, but it's an ongoing issue of, how do you continue to manage your cash globally? We feel pretty comfortable that we've been able to do that. One, it gives us affordable access. So we've been able to manage the tax rate fairly effectively and we've been able to do the share buybacks and pay the dividends, the other things that our shareholders want. That's something we continue to spend time and effort on. We feel pretty comfortable we've got strategies in place that allow us to do that in a similar manner that we've done in the past for at least the next several years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just a follow-up on a lot of what's been discussed. In the quarter in China, pricing was up 3 and I guess that would imply that, that overall mix might've been down 6, because average ticket was down 3 on a 3% comp. So I was hoping you guys could give a little bit more thought or analysis on that. I mean, is that because you're attracting new lower-income customers into the store because of the new value promotions? Or are you trading down existing customers? And the reason that I ask about trading down existing customers is there have been examples, especially in the U.S., where dollar-value menus, as it were, might actually constrain your ability to take price on the high end because the lower-priced products are too cheap relative to the higher-end products. And so not having been to the market and seeing this in the last quarter, I was just hoping to get some more clarification of: one, what customers you're bringing in; and secondly, whether the value-pricing action might actually act as somewhat of a constraint in terms of your ability to take pricing on the core and premium items.", "Richard Carucci", "Yes, I think -- let me break the dayparts down a little bit. Breakfast is one where what we did has driven a lot of incremental people into it, right? So I mentioned before that transactions made up 13% of our mix in the second quarter. Before that, I think it was around 10%, so it's a big increase there. And they are obviously bringing in a lot of new users, so not a lot of trade-down. The reason the -- we've been very careful on the lunch daypart, so the teams spent a lot of time -- we did not chase a lot of things we could have chased on value over the years. And even though our competition is probably doing more of that than we were, we think we hit on something right now that works in terms of -- tries to get some occasions. You're going to get some trade-down there and that's why we're very careful on that daypart in particular. But you sort of see, when you look at it from the big-picture perspective, we brought -- our transactions were ahead of our same-store sales growth, which is a good sign.", "John Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And in terms of your ability to take price on the core and premium items, to the extent that you decide to do so in the future, is it your opinion like the lunch value doesn't interfere with that at all?", "Richard Carucci", "Yes. Again, I'm still where David is. We did talk that we're doing a better job on the value, but you shouldn't look at this as we've gone to a value menu and this is something we're looking at. We're going to be very thoughtful on pricing. As we sort of said a couple of calls ago, we're looking at it a little bit more scientific. We look at regional opportunities as well. So again, we're going to be very thoughtful on how we do that, and we want to keep the brand affordable and protect our business model.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Gregory Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc", "Just real quick, just maybe quick thoughts on how you think re-franchising at KFC is going to progress over the next few quarters.", "Richard Carucci", "KFC, we had a pretty good quarter this time actually in re-franchising, so we had some good activity. It'll continue to go along. I mean, I'd expect numbers sort of hopefully a little bit better in total in the second half than the first half, so hopefully in line with somewhat our performance in the second quarter. So we ended up, I think, with about 75 units in the second quarter. We probably will get at least a couple of hundred done this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Two questions, I guess. The first one, just kind of a follow-on as it relates to food costs and the offset of pricing. I think you mentioned in China that you don't have much -- or no plan to take near-term pricing and not much visibility on food cost going into next year. I was just wondering whether you could talk about the U.S. on that front, first as it relates to pricing and where we are right now and what your thoughts are in the near-term. And then as we look to 2011, do you -- or 2012, I should say, do we have any better visibility on the food-cost outlook and your thoughts on pricing at that point? And then I have a follow-up.", "Richard Carucci", "Just for context, so far we've taken about 3% pricing in the U.S. Again, the challenge there is how much of it's flowing, spinning through to us. So we'll probably continue to take pricing pretty much in line with inflation. That seems to be what the industry is doing. Don't have a lot of visibility to next year yet. Hoping it'll be a little better than this year. There's some indication to that, but it's too early to tell.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "But a little better than this year, but you're still talking about -- I guess this year, the inflation basket thing is up 7, so it could still be up mid single perhaps, but not as bad as this year.", "Richard Carucci", "I don't really have visibility. I'll be surprised if it's in the range of this year, but we'll have to wait and see.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just separately on the leverage front, it looks like there was some significant pay-down in the second quarter, north of $600 million. Just wondering whether you expect such a trend to continue. We haven't seen any real pay-down in the past 6 quarters, and whether this has any impact on your long-term priority of debt pay down relative to share purchase and dividend. Or is this just more of a timing issue?", "Richard Carucci", "We actually had paid off some bonds that were due in the second quarter, and so we expected that.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital", "But that's not something we should expect going forward as aggressive pay-down? We should see it till be minimal going forward.", "David Novak", "No, there is -- I believe, Jeff, we have $250 million of maturities next year. So actually, the maturity schedule over the next 2 to 3 years is pretty good. It's really light. And we think -- as we've said in the past, we've been working towards moving our credit ratios towards BBB, solid BBB from where we were at BBB-, and we feel like we've made pretty darn good progress on that. So going forward, free cash after CapEx is really going to be focused on dividends and share repurchase, other than in the near term on the potential acquisition of Little Sheep.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve West with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Steve West", "My questions have already been answered.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Larry Miller with RBC.", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "I had a question on Taco Bell and maybe some of the consumer research that you may have done since the lawsuit. And the first part of it is, do you know where that light user has gone? And secondly, is there anything in the research that you can point to that would give us some comfort that it's not maybe a longer-lasting brand issue?", "David Novak", "Well, Taco Bell users are heavy users so they're going to other -- are staying within the category, basically. Although I have to tell you I haven't seen any specific numbers myself that could give you more color on that. What was the second part of your question?", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "The second part is, is there anything in the data that you guys have collected that says, \"Hey, this looks very temporary in terms of a brand issue\"? Or maybe there's something in here that says, \"Hey, these light users have told us that there's something that may be longer-lasting in terms of...\"", "David Novak", "I think the best data that we have is a history that it just takes time, and that over time that when you have issues like that, your light users will come back here, okay? That's the best data that we have.", "All right. Well, I want to thank all of you for your questions. As we've talked about, we're very confident we're going to have another good year at Yum! Brands, and we'll keep you posted on our progress. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Tim Jerzyk, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, David.

Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.", "I would also like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements.

Our Annual Investor and Analyst Conference in New York City will be Wednesday, December 7. Please register for that as soon as possible. Monday, February 6, 2012, fourth quarter earnings will be released. This was previously scheduled for February 1, so please adjust your calendars.", "On our call today, you will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. Now I'll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David C. Novak", "Okay. Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it's interesting to note that this Friday, October 7, is our Founders' Day and marks the 14th anniversary of our company. From the very beginning, our formula for success has been people capability first, satisfy customers and profitability follow. I'm proud of how we win together, ownership culture we have developed and pleased with the strong returns we have generated for our shareholders, with our share price up well over 500% since our spinoff from PepsiCo. I'm even more pleased we continue to have tremendous optimism about the future growth of our company.", "Our people know the 3 keys to driving shareholder value, and believe me, we are focused on them now more than ever: new unit development, same-store sales growth and return on invested capital. Our new unit opportunity in China is the best in retail, and our opportunity to expand is bigger than ever as we know India, Russia, Africa, France and Germany have all reached inflection points for growth. We are also laying a foundation for more substantial same-store sales growth in our 38,000 restaurants by developing breakfast, beverages and broader menu variety that will leverage existing assets and make our brands even more relevant. Meanwhile, our returns should continue to be among the best in retail, with return on invested capital of over 20%.", "I often say the best thing about business is the unfinished business. Clearly, we are on the ground floor of global growth with decades of unfinished business ahead.", "Now onto our results. I'm pleased to report 13% EPS growth for the third quarter, excluding special items, and confidently reaffirm our full-year EPS growth forecast of at least 12%. We are proud that 2011 will mark the 10th consecutive year we exceed our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth. Our strong performance in China and other emerging markets continues to be the catalyst of our growth. We now expect to open about 1,500 new international units this year, which not only adds to earnings for 2011, but sets us up for an incremental growth in 2012.", "We are particularly pleased with our China business, which reported record transaction growth and record expected new unit growth. There's no question China has powerful brand equity of both KFC and Pizza Hut with outstanding new unit returns. At Yum! Restaurants International, system sales grew 8%, including 13% system sales growth in emerging markets, both prior to foreign currency translation. In the U.S., we saw another quarter of poor results in what remains a tough environment.", "Now let me take you through our key strategies and trends for each of our divisions. First, I'd like to thank all of you that attended our recent China Investor Conference in Shanghai and saw the leadership and tremendous operating team we have there. I'd like to thank Sam Su and the team for hosting our guests at this great event.", "I'm obviously very proud of our China team's continued strong performance. For the third quarter, units expanded 14% and same-store sales grew 19%, driven by same-store transaction growth of 27%. Our China division's operating profit has grown 15% year-to-date, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Operating profit grew 7% this quarter, excluding foreign currency translation. Keep in mind that we are overlapping our participation in the World Expo in Shanghai, which added about $10 million of profit to last year's number. Excluding this overlap, our China team delivered another double-digit earnings growth quarter.", "New unit development continues to be the major driver of our growth, and we remain the largest U.S. retail developer in China. We've opened 329 new units through our first 3 quarters and expect to open a record 600 this year, which will be record development year for us in China. Our China new unit returns remain a key focus for us and continue to be the best in our business.", "Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let's start with KFC. We added 110 new units this quarter and now have nearly 3,500 restaurants, making KFC the largest Western QSR concept in China. While we're certainly viewed as the chicken experts, our menu includes beef, seafood and rice dishes, as well as other products with broad appeal to Chinese customers. Our brand strategy is to be rooted in China, and our diverse menu offerings are proof positive we are delivering on this goal.", "We are working on 4 key initiatives that will grow the business and build strong unit economics well into the future:", "First, KFC breakfast is in virtually all of our restaurants. Our breakfast daypart has seen its transactions double this year, accounting for about 30% of total transaction growth. Our menu has broad appeal to Chinese consumers, who are increasingly eating breakfast outside of home. We made the decision to offer compelling value to drive traffic to build this underutilized daypart. We knew this would have a negative impact on our check average and in fact, accounts for about half of our total check decline this year. Even with all this transaction success, breakfast still accounts for 7% -- only 7% of our overall sales. We are clearly on the ground floor of building this important daypart.", "Next is delivery, which is now available in over 1,600 KFC restaurants. This fast-growing delivery segment is primarily in higher tier cities. We're also expanding our 24-hour operations initiative now in about 50% of our restaurants.", "Finally, let me talk about our new lunch and afternoon snack value initiatives. As we look at the inflationary environment and the Chinese consumer sensitivity to rising prices, we made the conscious decision to bring even more customers into our restaurants. This has resulted in extraordinary traffic gains. With that said, higher inflation more than offset the modest pricing we took earlier this year and was the primary driver of our decline in margins. As you would expect, we're taking very prudent steps to adjust this going forward. As you saw, our third quarter margins were still over 21%, and we expect margins to continue to sustain in the 20% range on an annual basis.", "Any way you look at it, the KFC brand in China is having an incredible year. All our research tells us we're building our leadership position and making our brand even more relevant. The tremendous increases in new units and traffic puts us in a nice position to continue our strong growth in 2012.", "Now we also have achieved tremendous growth and vibrancy at Pizza Hut in China. Pizza Hut Casual Dining goes beyond pizza and continues to unquestionably be the leading western casual dining concept in China, with over 560 units in over 120 cities. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive double-digit same-store sales growth quarter for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. The menu is revamped twice a year and continues to offer a broad variety of entr\u00e9es, including beef, chicken and rice dishes, along with appetizers, beverages and desserts.", "We are having tremendous success building a true casual dining concept with everyday affordable value. In fact, our new unit returns are now comparable to KFC, and we expect to open about 100 Pizza Hut Casual Dining restaurants this year. We're especially pleased to be opening Pizza Huts not only in the largest cities but in Tier 3, 4 and 5 cities as well.", "We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service in the home service delivery category now has over 120 units in 12 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, continues to make progress as we drive for scalable economics.", "In summary, our China business is having a fantastic year. The progress we're making in executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category is exceptional.", "Next, Yum! Restaurants International. Before I speak about this quarter's results, I'd also like to thank all of you that attended our YRI Investor Day in Dallas this past August, and saw our leadership present the tremendous emerging market opportunities we have, as well as the recent success we're having in France and Germany. I'd like to thank Graham Allan and the team for hosting our guests at this event.", "For the quarter, YRI produced solid results, with system sales growth of 8% and operating profit growth of 3%, both prior to foreign currency translation. Same-store sales increased 3%. Operating profit was negatively impacted by $6 million or 5% due to anticipated closures related to our decision to completely refranchise our Pizza Hut business in the U.K. As our focus shifts to high-growth, high-return businesses, we decided this business would be better served in the hands of a capable franchisee. The refranchising decision for this business reinforces our commitment to shareholders to leverage high-return franchise fees and concentrate even more company equity on high-growth, high-return businesses in emerging markets.", "New unit development is a key driver of growth for this business and continued with 193 new units this quarter, including 127 new units in emerging markets. Over 90% of these units were opened by our strong network of franchisees, and we continue to expect to open about 900 new units at Yum! Restaurants International for the full year. It's the new unit development, specifically in emerging markets, that sets Yum! apart and is positioning YRI for many successful years in the future. Over 85% of the 14,500 traditional restaurants in this division are franchise units, which generate a steady growing stream of franchise royalties.", "Yum! Restaurants International has 5 markets we are particularly excited about: India, Russia, Africa, France and Germany. Last year, these markets contributed about $60 million of profit to YRI, but our projections call for that number to grow to over $300 million over the next 5 years.", "Today, I want to talk about 2 of these significant opportunities, Germany and Russia, where I recently spent time with our talented local teams. Before I talk about Germany, I think it's important to briefly discuss the success we're having in France to give it some context. Our restaurants in France actually have the highest average unit volumes in the world for Yum!. It's also the first market where we experimented with a business rental program to drive unit development and returns. The reason I bring this up is that we've taken this successful model and applied it to Germany. ", "Today, in Germany, we have 75 KFCs, mid-teen margins and more transactions per store than we do in France. The team is committed to tripling its restaurant count to 225 units in the next 5 years. Remember, our experience tells us it takes time to build a brand the right way, but once you get to about 100 units, your scale allows you to accelerate growth. Within the next 18 months, we plan on utilizing national television advertising for the first time because of that scale. As I said, our transaction volumes are strong. We've also averaged 5% same-store sales growth over the past 5 years, and we now have margins in the mid-teens. So our new unit economics are coming together. ", "Our challenge going forward is to secure great sites in Germany as fast as our people capability allows. KFC has a long way to go in Germany. The team is rallying behind the slogan, KFC wonderland in the making, and after seeing the business first-hand and seeing the action Joaquin Grip [ph], our Germany General Manager, and his team are taking, I'm confident that we're going to get there. We know that McDonald's makes more money in France and Germany alone than we make in all of Yum! Restaurants International. Our intention is to build a big business in these countries as well, and we're making significant progress to do just that.", "Russia is another country where we have to tip our hat to McDonald's, who we estimate makes over $1 million profit per restaurant annually. We also have aggressive growth plans in Russia. In July of last year, we completed our acquisition of Rostik's and got full control of the KFC Rostik's brand in Russia, giving us 151 restaurants. Recently, we began rebranding the KFC Rostik units to KFC stand-alone restaurants. Our results have been excellent. This year, same-store sales growth has been over 20%, and restaurant margins are in the high teens. The best is yet to come as we are just getting started with our single-minded focus on KFC in Russia.", "Overall, Yum! Restaurants International growth and development is on track. It's great to see our leading position in emerging markets complemented by ground-floor opportunities in Continental Europe. Our strategy remains to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere.", "Next, onto our U.S. business, where focus is to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. As indicated on our second quarter call, we knew operating profit would be challenged in the third quarter, and it was. Operating profit declined 16%, as same-store sales fell 3%. And higher commodity costs weighed on margins. ", "Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable brand in the U.S., saw same-store sales decline 2% in the quarter. While this is not an acceptable result for us, it is an improvement from the 5% decline we saw in the second quarter, and it's versus more difficult comparisons from last year. The team is working incredibly hard to get Taco Bell back on a growth track, and we are confident we will do so. We have market-tested category-breakthrough innovation in the pipeline that will reenergize the Taco Bell brand towards the end of the first quarter of next year. In the meantime, it's all hands on deck to get Taco Bell back on the growth track.", "Overall, while our U.S. business results have certainly been disappointing, we have aggressively developed category-leading innovation and have productivity initiatives planned to dramatically improve both sales and profit performance in 2012.", "Let me wrap up the total Yum! story. Overall, we're having another solid year. 10 straight years of double-digit EPS growth is something not too many companies can claim. With very strong performance in China and other emerging markets, as well as robust new unit international development, we're confident in our future growth as well. So as we look to 2012, we're confident our international businesses are set up for continued growth, and we have plans in place to dramatically improve U.S. profitability. We have a track record that proves how powerful our growth model is. With the expected opening of 1,500 international new units this year and our strategies in the base business, we're in a good position for next year and expect to continue our track record of double-digit earnings growth in 2012 and beyond.", "Now let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Carucci.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to provide some commentary on our third quarter results and our outlook for the balance of 2011. I will then review changes we are making to our business portfolio and provide some of our initial expectations for 2012.", "During the first 2 earnings calls this year, I categorized our 2011 results as a tale of 2 cities. Strong international growth, especially in China, has been a contrast to poor U.S. performance. This quarter is essentially more of the same.", "China produced another impressive quarter. Revenue increased an amazing 35% as we benefited from new unit growth, same-store transaction growth of 27% and favorable foreign exchange. On the other hand, profit growth and margins were less than what we would expect with this type of sales increase. Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter, excluding foreign exchange, or 11% adjusting for the 2010 impact of the Shanghai World Expo. Margin declined 3.9 percentage points to a little over 21%.", "Let me walk you through the details on margins. With commodity inflation of 8% and labor inflation of about 20% in the quarter, we had some significant headwinds. Margins in the quarter were also affected by the new business tax this year and the overlap of the Expo. Taken together, commodity inflation, labor inflation, the business tax and the Expo overlap caused about 7 points of margin pressure. The pricing we took in the first quarter helped to offset about 3 of the 7 points. There were some other moving pieces, but the gap between the inflation and pricing is by far the biggest contributor of the 3.9-point margin decline versus last year.", "So let's briefly discuss some of the other moving pieces. First, our new unit development pace picked up significantly this year. The additional labor and preopening expenses offset some of the margin benefit of our transaction growth. Additionally, some of our same-store sales growth was driven by targeted daypart value initiatives that David walked you through. Due to the higher costs of these initiatives, the profit flow-through through this transaction growth was less than what you would normally expect.", "Going forward, we realize we have some work to do to close the gap between pricing and inflation. We're taking actions to do this. Our first step was a 2% price increase implemented the last week of September.", "Going forward, we expect even higher inflation in the fourth quarter. We now expect mid-teens food inflation and labor inflation of about 20% in the quarter. To help offset this, we expect to tweak our value offerings later this year. Despite these initiatives, this level of pricing still lags the impact of a high inflation rates. We therefore expect a decline in fourth quarter year-over-year margins.", "We continue to expect restaurant margins of about 20% for the full year. Going forward, we see no reason why we cannot continue to deliver at least 20% margins in China. We believe that we will perform well financially because we have all the necessary leverage, including a strong competitive position, purchasing scale, a seasoned management team, a nationwide presence and expanding dayparts. In addition, the combination of our cell phone distribution system and large development team allows for profitable unit expansion in lower tier cities.", "We really like our position in China. We have excellent sales momentum and expect solid double-digit same-store sales again in quarter 4. Our development continues to be robust. 600 new units is clearly an impressive number, and we continue to generate cash paybacks of less than 3 years. This is a portfolio that delivers high returns and high growth.", "Let's move to Yum! Restaurants International. Our YRI business had another solid quarter, with same-store sales growth of 3%. Operating profit growth of 3% prior to ForEx included the impact of some onetime items. Excluding a $6 million impairment expense for the Pizza Hut U.K. business, operating profit growth was 8% for the third quarter. Additionally, YRI experienced a $4 million expense for the biannual franchise convention. On the positive side, we received $5 million generated from the change in ownership of one of our large KFC franchisees in Australia.", "Restaurant margin declined 0.2 points to 12.3%. This decline was driven by soft sales and inflation in Australia and weak margins in the Pizza Hut U.K. business. Although margins continued to improve in Thailand and France, the year-over-year impact was less than in previous quarters. We still expect margins to improve significantly for the full year. As we continue to update our ownership portfolio and increase our scale in key markets, our margin should continue to improve.", "Overall, we believe that Yum! Restaurants International business is gaining strength. We are particularly pleased with our new unit development and exceptionally strong performance in emerging and underpenetrated markets. We believe that these factors provide a solid base for sales and profit growth in 2012 and beyond.", "Our U.S. business had a disappointing quarter. Sales improved versus the second quarter, but inflation hurt margins. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that sales will remain a challenge. We will likely see another same-store sales decrease. Fortunately, we expect to benefit from the overlap of high G&A costs from last year, as well as the 53rd week this year. This should help improve U.S. operating profits in the fourth quarter considerably. ", "As we finish looking at 2011, let me provide some more expectations about the impact of the 53rd week this year. The 53rd week provides a $25 million operating profit benefit. This represents a $0.04 EPS benefit in the fourth quarter. This benefit is split between the YRI and U.S. businesses, and for the full year, we committed about $20 million in higher-than-normal spending. This spending includes development and operational initiatives for our Pizza Hut U.S. business and the higher impairment expenses at Pizza Hut U.K.", "The bulk of this spending is already reflected in our year-to-date financial results, while about $3 million of the $20 million is spending that is anticipated in the fourth quarter. When you put all of this together, we are still quite confident that Yum! will deliver EPS growth of at least 12% in 2011.", "Before we look ahead into 2012, let's first reflect on some key decisions we made this year to realign the Yum! portfolio. Our philosophy is simple. We reduced company ownership in highly penetrated or underperforming markets. We increased exposure in emerging and underpenetrated markets. We have continued to be disciplined and proactive in managing this aspect of the business. In 2011, we made several decisions that will serve to reduce our financial footprint in highly penetrated markets. ", "First of all, we continued our U.S. refranchising program. This year's focus is on refranchising KFC restaurants. For the full year, we expect to refranchise about 400 restaurants, and the majority of these are KFC units. We expect to end the year with about 500 KFC company-owned restaurants. The game plan is to retain 5% ownership or less than 250 units.", "This quarter, we also announced an agreement to sell Long John Silver's and A&W All American Restaurants. I know it's tough to run a business during a selling process, and I would like to thank the LJS and A&W teams for all of their hard work this year. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, and we wish our franchise partners and the teams every success going forward.", "In our release, we also announced a decision to refranchise our Pizza Hut U.K. business. We believe this will improve Yum! Restaurants International's profits and margins.", "Every year, we increase our exposure in high-growth emerging markets through our new unit growth. This year, there are also 2 potential transactions that could increase our ownership in underpenetrated markets. We made a bid to acquire Little Sheep in China, and we plan to acquire a KFC South African franchisee. We are still awaiting China government approval and have nothing new to report on Little Sheep, so let me talk about Africa.", "We expect to close on the South African deal later this month. We already have a great franchise business in South Africa with over 600 restaurants. We believe that the 70 units we're acquiring provide another growth vehicle in that country. These restaurants will also provide a base for us to train our franchisees in the balance of Africa. We remain hopeful that in the long term, Africa can become a large franchised business and a meaningful source of growth. In the past year, we opened KFCs in 4 new countries in Africa, and our goal is to spread aggressively across the continent. As we head into 2012, we believe that our portfolio has never been stronger, and that we're building upon our advantage in emerging markets.", "We are still in the process of developing detailed plans for our businesses in 2012. Therefore, I will not talk about sales and profit plans today. As usual, we will share information on these subjects at our December meeting. However, I do want to share some initial thoughts for 2012 and some items that will influence our performance.", "We are fortunate that our new unit development usually provides us with a head start on building a profit plan. This year is no exception. The development of 1,500 new units outside the U.S. in 2011 will provide us with a head start for 2012. Overall, we expect new unit development to contribute about half of our 2012 growth.", "We expect to see benefits in 2012 from share repurchases. In our release, we have pointed to year-to-date 2011 share repurchases of $545 million. We expect about $800 million in repurchases for the full year and a similar amount in 2012. The impact of these share repurchases should provide 2 points of 2012 EPS growth.", "While it's uncertain how the dollar will perform against most other currencies next year, it's probably a good bet that we get RMB translation benefits again in 2012. Now don't get me wrong. We expect 2012 to be another challenging year. The economic climate is very uncertain. Inflation could also rear its head, especially in the first half of the year.", "We know that we need to turn around our U.S. business. But Taco Bell is a resilient brand, and we will have easy overlaps next year. As David mentioned, in addition to our innovation pipeline, we will be taking a hard look at managing costs within our U.S. business.", "I do have a lot of confidence in our business model. I have faith in our team's ability to grow the business and manage costs tightly. Our global portfolio has led with 13% annual EPS growth over the past decade. This decade has included quite a few individual challenging years. I also just told you that our portfolio has never been stronger. Therefore, I believe 2012 will be another year where Yum! will deliver strong results for our shareholders. ", "Back to you, David.", "David C. Novak", "Okay, Rick. Thank you very much, and let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I'm sure you're going to get a lot of questions about the China margins this quarter, and there are many reasons for that. You stated some of them. But just taking a step back, I'm curious about the strategy for China in 2011. Are you getting from this business what you thought you would get at the beginning of the year? And I guess, I'm drilling into the fact that you had accelerating inflation, and you knew that. You were also pursuing 2 major value-menu launches, one at breakfast earlier in the year, one at the beginning of the third quarter with the lunch stuff. And you -- and all this time, you've waited on pricing. Since late January, you have not raised price, and even in the -- back in January, it wasn't a hell of a lot of price. And then on top of that, you're embracing a rather expensive ramp-up in unit development here in the third quarter, putting further pressure on margins. And so I'm wondering, and I guess a lot of folks are wondering, why have you been so stingy on the price? And are you getting some sort of reactions on all this stuff that you weren't expecting? Any help on this will be great.", "Richard T. Carucci", "David will talk about the consumer side, and then I'll have the financial aspect of it, David.", "David C. Novak", "Okay. Well, first of all, David, our strategy is a brand-building strategy and an asset leverage-building strategy, and what we're trying to do is make our brand as compelling and as relevant and as ubiquitous as it can possibly be in China. And if you look at the real success factors in this category, you have a broad menu, you leverage your asset throughout the day and you make your products affordable on an everyday basis. And in China, we're doing this, and we're doing it with great margins this year. And I think what I feel terrific about is that we're getting everything that we want to get out of China. We're continuing to grow this business, and we have a great team of people there that are focused on building this brand and building dayparts and leveraging that asset throughout the day. But they are, first and foremost, brand builders, and I think that's what we're doing. We have tremendous operational excellence. We're maintaining fantastic operations as we're dramatically improving our transactions. Our average unit volumes now are $1.7 million. So we're getting -- our new unit cash flows and margins are as good as they've ever been, and so we're having another excellent year in China on top of a great year last year. So strategically, the only thing I think we've done is further solidified our strength with the customer. We will have -- this year, we're going to set a record for new units. We're going to have 600 new units. So just think of the transaction growth we're achieving, sales growth we're achieving, the margins that we have, and we're still adding a record number of 600 units. So to me, looking back and stepping back and looking at China, it would be hard for me to say, if I could -- if someone said, \"Can we write this story? Last year, at the beginning of January, could we have this kind of performance?\" I'd say, \"Give it to me. Give it to me this year. Give it to me next year. Keep it going.\" And the best thing about our business is that we've got KFC moving in all cylinders in China. And also, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we've got Pizza Hut now, which has been dramatically transformed. We're going into 100 -- we're going to open up 100 stores of Pizza Hut this year. We're going into Tier 3, 4 and 5 cities. In Pizza Hut, we only have 500 units. So we are constantly just trying to build these brands the right way. I've always said that we've got these tremendous diamonds. We just got to keep polishing them and growing them the right way. And our people capabilities have never been better, the brand's never been stronger, and Yum! in total is going to have another excellent year.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Just on the financial side, David, and by the way, I'm in the same place that David is, is I think China is having a spectacular year overall. We are still new at the game of value in China, some of the value initiatives. So the first ones we did were earlier this year in breakfast, and then around April time, at lunch and snacking. So we're still on version 1.0 of doing value initiatives, and all along, we recognize we're going to read the consumer and see what it did. I think we're very happy with the transaction gains that we had. We have quite a bit of growth in breakfast, which is fantastic. We probably had a little bit higher mix to some of those value initiatives that we would have guessed at lunchtime. But we always knew going into this that we could adjust. Now the only thing that makes the adjustment tricky is in the fourth quarter, inflation -- towards the end of the third quarter it was a little higher than what we were anticipating. To your point, we were anticipating high inflation, but the labor inflation, starting the year, we thought would be in mid-teens. And in the quarter, it was 20%, and we think it's probably going to be about 20% in the fourth quarter as well. And then commodity inflation, we thought, would not get up or not get higher in the fourth quarter. So that -- the biggest issue that we probably have is the adjustments towards the value. It will take us a little bit of time, but again, I couldn't be happier with the overall results. The profit results we have year-to-date, excluding ForEx, are 15%, and that's on top of 26% last year. So we feel -- I'll take it as David says. Regarding the unit development, I mean, to me, that's a no-brainer if you could get more units in China. The team is extremely disciplined on development, and one of the good things that came out of the last 5-year plan is that the government is sort of starting to build city clusters around some of the major -- about 20 or 25 major cities. We think that gives us new unit opportunities once some new trade zones will be developed as they're going to build housing in those areas. But they're also building trains and buses and stations and all of that, which those type of infrastructure things help us. So it's really been a combination of that investment and the trade zones, if that opens up for KFC, as well as David in his speech talked about how Pizza Hut is now able to get into Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities much more profitably than before. So that's allowed us to increase our Pizza Hut development significantly. So if I could -- if we could build 600 units a year going forward, and if that causes us a quarter issue with labor, that's like a no-brainer. We still get less than 3-year paybacks on those investments. So we feel great about where we stand in China.", "David C. Novak", "So in summary, both KFC and Pizza Hut brands have never been stronger. Both brands are more ubiquitous than ever before. We're leveraging our assets throughout the day. We're opening up new units with returns that are at least, if not better, than any that we've ever had, and we're more optimistic than ever about the breadth and future of these 2 brands. And with the China consuming class going from 300 million to 600 million over the next -- in the coming years, we couldn't be in a better place. So very pleased with this year in China.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up on some of the discussion related to China margins. Rick, I was wondering if you could maybe comment on how the team there is planning to manage the long-term structure of the China margins. I know you've given up a little bit of ground this year, but the economic model still remains quite healthy. So should we think about China as maybe a 20%-type restaurant margin over the next several years, and the plan is not to necessarily recover some of the margins that you've lost this year? Maybe just explain how you're thinking about that business.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, I think to your point, David, clearly, the inflation this year is higher than normal. So it's hard to chase the inflation when it's that high. Our hope is that inflation, especially commodity inflation, will abate by midyear next year. Labor inflation, we think, will remain high but not as high as it was in the back part of this year. So in terms of how to deal with inflation though, I do want to emphasize that we're in a better position to do it than, we think, everybody else. We have a different levers that I talked about in my speech in terms of different dayparts, strong distribution system, and so we could take pricing in different areas, in different parts of the country, et cetera. And with our capability, we think we're better equipped than pretty much anyone else there to deal with inflation. Part of the game plan is that we will gradually take pricing and catch up to inflation. And then when inflation abates, we'll be back -- to your point, I think we expect, I'd call it at least 20% margins. But, again, we knew that we were off of very high margins a year ago. So we never thought -- going into this year, we didn't anticipate that we would keep that level of margin. So I think somewhere between a little over 20% is probably where the margins will shake out over the next couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "It's Jack Holland [ph] actually on behalf of Greg. Yes, it looks like you guys had a nice improvement at Taco Bell this quarter, and maybe even a little bit sooner than you had initially anticipated. I think you called out 4Q for that improvement back in the 2Q. So what do you think are the factors behind that improvement? Has the lawsuit concern sort of abated? And has that momentum continued into 4Q as well?", "David C. Novak", "Well, I think that Taco Bell is making steady improvement, but a slow improvement, and we're obviously not pleased with our same-store sales. Any time your same-store sales are down, you can't be at all pleased about it. But to your point, we have improved. We went from down 5% in the second quarter to down 2%, and our 2-year numbers are plus one, if you look at a 2-year basis. But I think it's been just more of the same without any real significant breakthroughs. And what we've really been working on this year is, first of all, just across the board and around the world at Yum! Brands, we've been focused on operational excellence and making sure that we deliver a great experience to our customers. We've been focused on maintaining our #1 value initiative. But what we really think is going to really get Taco Bell moving and back on the growth track is more category innovation. And so what I'm really pleased about is this year, we have proven and test marketed that we do have exactly that coming forward, which will be launched at the end of first quarter. Taco Bell, in conjunction with our 50th anniversary, will be reinventing the taco. We've got some major news coming. So I think you're going to see some pretty much blocking and tackling, more of the same until we get to the end of the first quarter, and then we think we'll have a significant uplift in our business.", "Richard T. Carucci", "And just to add to David's comments about what we see through the balance of the year and into the early part of next year, just as a reminder, the laps for Taco Bell do get a little bit more challenging in Q4. So that, combined with the fact that, as David said, the real look forward is the new innovation coming at the end of Q1 next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I have 2 questions. The first one is, is it worth or is it even possible in China to get better visibility on pricing for -- on food for the security purposes? In other words, McDonald's is experiencing what they claim is low single-digit inflation right now. And I know you can't speak to that specifically, but it does underscore that it is possible to get lower volatility in food. It would seem that since you've got the ownership and the distribution, you would have a natural advantage there and see lower volatility, and yet you're seeing higher volatility. So can you explain why that is the case? And is there a movement, not a change, of how you purchase food to avoid these situations in the future?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I really, John, can't talk to McDonald's, but I will talk to what we have. I mean, if you look at -- to your point, if you look at what our food inflation has been, if you go out and go to the last 5 or 6 years, it's been way below what the inflation rate has been for food. And we were getting purchasing efficiencies and all of those benefits as well. So we have a world-class supply chain group in China. We have very strong distribution. So our costs are very, I think, very well-managed there. The challenge that we've had really has been on the proteins the last several years. So when you've seen this spike, it's been really related to -- we think it's been going with the market on both pork and chicken. So pork has had a lot of several price spikes the last few years. That has impact on [indiscernible] because those are the 2 leading proteins in China. So that's really what's been driving the volatility, we think, on the chicken has really been what's happened on the pork side in China. We're hoping that, that will abate early next year on the pork side, and it will start seeing better chicken cost, I'd say starting in around the second quarter next year, but that's a guess at this point. We'll give you better data if we have it in December.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you just decompose that 700 basis points pressure you talked about, Rick, on the labor side between wage rate inflation, what the openings put on that? And then on the food side, what's just the inflation versus what's the impact of these promotions?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, if you just want to think about it simplistically on a year-over-year basis, there's obviously a lot of moving parts. If you take 8% food inflation on our base of about 34% or so, you get a little under 3 points of inflation on the food side. If you take 20% inflation on labor, which was about 14% last year of our base cost, that gets you to, again, a little under 3%. So food inflation and labor inflation in Q3 is equal to about 6% impact on margins.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm sorry, and then the remaining 100 basis points has to do with the value promotions?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, yes, and then there's a lot of other moving part points. In my speech, I talked about the business tax, the Expo lap. In Q3, that was about 1 point, but then you obviously have benefits from transaction gains, et cetera. But from an inflation standpoint, it was about 6 points of the issue. Unfortunately, in Q4, that goes up to about 8 points because we said we expect mid-teen in inflation on the food side and still about 20% on the labor side. And so the September price increase will basically offset that increase. And then I mentioned before, we're going to tweak our value initiatives, which will be another step in that direction. But yes, that's what we didn't expect. We didn't expect the fourth quarter to be 2 points higher than the third quarter, so that piece we were taken by surprise on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was curious to follow up on your comments about rightsizing the cost structure in the U.S. Now with operating profits down as much as they are, are we talking about just sharpening the pencil or further on the spectrum, a formal restructuring or somewhere in the middle? What kind of things are you looking to do?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, we've always looked aggressively at our cost structure. We've also -- over time, we mentioned where we continue to refranchise our business in KFC, and therefore, as we do that, that will have a modest impact on our cost structure. We will continue to look at this, and we're still developing plans as we go forward. We'll probably have more to say on it in the fourth quarter, Mike.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "All right. And then on an unrelated kind of housekeeping note, from a financial perspective, what should we expect the impact of the Long John, A&W and Pizza Hut U.K. refranchising on the P&L? Are those actions accretive, dilutive or roughly break-even? What do you think?", "Richard T. Carucci", "About break-even. The LJS will be very slightly negative impact, about flat. And then the Pizza Hut U.K., depending on when it occurs, will be slightly positive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Rick, first, a simple one. If you said this, excuse me, but what are you thinking on the full-year tax rate? Are you still thinking around 26%?", "Richard T. Carucci", "No change there. Again, as we said before, it's the hardest one to predict. Just so -- it moves around based on onetime events. That's just how the accounting works.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then another question on the China margins. The strength in breakfast and the development of the delivery and even the 24-hour business, are all of those dilutive to margins? And can you quantify the impact of developing those additional sales layers, the impact on margins?", "Richard T. Carucci", "In breakfast -- what we're selling now at breakfast is probably about 8 points higher of food cost as a percentage of sales basis than the rest of the menu. Delivery, I really can't speak to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Larry Miller with RBC.", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, 2 quick questions as well. So you mentioned tweaking the value menu in China. Can you give us a sense of what you're doing and how you might stack up competitively? It looks like a lot of other folks are doing value as well. And then secondly, just on the negative mix in China, you said half of it was related to your value initiatives. What would you describe the other half to?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Sorry, could you repeat the second part of the question again?", "Larry Miller - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So you had a negative mix in China. I think it was close to 8 or 9 points of negative mix. You said half of that was related to the value initiatives at breakfast. What's the other half on the negative? Is it consumer pushback on pricing? Is it some other initiatives that you have? Or is it competitive pressure? What might be the other half?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, Larry, I think -- we're assuming you're talking about check average. We said breakfast was about half of that. If we're wrong on your -- the assumption list, no, but the rest of it would be the value initiatives at lunch and afternoon snack.", "Richard T. Carucci", "And we're not going to tell you, obviously for competitive reasons, exactly what we're going to do on the value side, but we're looking at those bundles. So, for example, we have a 6-RMB offering at breakfast and a 15-RMB offering at lunch, and we're looking at what the composition of those bundles are.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. First, on the outlook for 2012, I know you don't want to get too specific. But big picture, should we assume another sort of above-average type of year on China comps, given the amount of pricing you're probably going to have in the menu for next year? Or how should we think about the mix versus traffic? You're lapping some big traffic numbers but also some big negative mix numbers. Just trying to think about the components of comps in China next year.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, it's a hard one to call. To your point, we are going to get the benefits of pricing. On the other hand -- we expect that to continue into next year. On the other hand, we're lapping some extraordinary large increases in transactions. So we just don't know where it will shake out, to be honest with you. But again, I do want to remind you, our model doesn't require the type of sales growth that we had this year. Our model requires I think about a 5% or 6% same-store sales growth. So we may have more visibility as we get deeper into this year, but obviously, we expect the fourth quarter to still be strong. We have a lot of momentum right now.", "David C. Novak", "I think the other thing too is that as we look at the sales, remember, we're very early days in all of the daypart initiatives that we're driving up against. So breakfast, for example, is only 7% of our total sales mix. We've only got delivery in 1,500 units. So we're in 24-hour services. All this is early days on the asset leverage. And we of course will have lots of product news, like we have in our China business, above brand. So I think there's tremendous upside as we go forward.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick one on the unit growth. Is the 600 number for China kind of the number going forward that we're using for 2012 as well, I'm assuming?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I think it's as good a number as any right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "It's Ahmoud Ganomon [ph] for John. Just in terms of the U.S., it sounds like you've committed yourself to a pretty major reinvestment in terms of Taco Bell beginning early next year, and I know that the brand probably does have the highest probability of your 3 brands. But it does seem like the return on investment would be higher if you directed it towards maybe an acceleration of growth in one of the international businesses. So could you just talk a little bit about your thoughts based on the \"you earn the right to own\" premise about refranchising that brand, potentially even down to 5% like KFC and Pizza Hut?", "David C. Novak", "Well, first of all, we have the \"earn the right to own\" mentality around the world. So we're looking at Taco Bell just like we've looked at Pizza Hut and KFC, and we do think that there's some opportunity there. I think in terms of next year, I don't think we look at it as a year of reinvestment. We just think we look at it, a year a lot of the investments that we've made paying off, because we've made investments in the pipeline. We have some proven products that we feel good about, and we expect that we'll be able to drive the top line. The biggest thing that's impacting our business at Taco Bell this year is the sale de-leverage, and we think we ought to be able to get same-store sales growth as we go forward. We're also going to be expanding breakfast next year in the Western part of the United States, and we think that will begin at March, towards the long-term rollout of breakfast on a national basis.", "Richard T. Carucci", "And, John, just to build on David's point, the margins and the profit history of Taco Bell over the last decade has been quite different than KFC and Pizza Hut, and that will be reflected in our plans.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A couple of questions, just first looking to -- on the China front, I think you mentioned a couple of times that momentum thus far in the fourth quarter has sustained itself. Obviously, we've heard a lot of cautionary comments on China and the slowing in trends. So just wanted to confirm that over the past months, since these results are reflecting that you're not seeing any deceleration or any shift in kind of the consumer spending habits on the China comp. And then just kind of looking at China with the high teens comp you're doing right now, once you lap the value side of things, like where do you think is the underlying run rate x the value that we should be assuming? Like how much of that comp lift that you're getting is value-offer driven, so we can kind of assess the underlying run rate? And then I have a follow-up.", "Richard T. Carucci", "We don't discuss trends within a quarter, but we do discuss that there's a major change from the last quarter. So we have nothing to tell you, which I guess tells you something. Regarding what the underlying rate -- it's really hard to call. There's just too many moving parts: the different inflation rates, different labor rates, et cetera. What I would say though is that I've seen a lot of reports on China, and people are trying to estimate what's going to happen in their economy. And I'm not sure if they're going to be any better than people trying to estimate what happens in the U.S. economy. I think from our business, what we keep our eye on is the point that David made earlier about what's happening in the middle class. And everything that we see is that the increases in the labor rates, the people moving from the countryside to the city, the establishment of these city clusters, et cetera -- I sort of like those type of macro trends, and to me, I haven't seen any deterioration of those. If anything, I think the 5-year plan may have helped us a little bit because labor is going to grow a little bit -- labor rates are growing a little bit faster, and we're going to get that infrastructure in those city clusters. So I feel pretty good still about the, I call it, the broad macros. In terms of month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter economic trends, I don't know if we're any better than anybody else who's out there. But as I sort of said before, I feel we could deal with the environmental shifts, whatever they are, pretty well given the quality of our team, our national presence and the different dayparts that we have.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to follow up, you mentioned Taco Bell, specifically next year, obviously benefits from having easy compares as you mentioned. And then it seems like the back half of the first quarter, you're pretty excited about the product innovation. I'm just wondering whether the breakfast reference was something totally additive to those other things. Any color you can give. I know breakfast has been a focus for a long time now, and it's been in test for a long period of time. I'm just wondering if you can give any color in terms of what you're seeing in the test markets to give confidence to roll it out in '12, at least to the Western part of U.S.", "David C. Novak", "Well, we've had test markets in the Western part of the U.S. which says basically we'll be able to expand breakfast there and do it well. And we're continuing to develop the breakfast daypart and our product innovations around that and how we approach value for the rest of the country. So we're beginning the rollout in the area where we think that we have the greatest opportunity for success.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, I think it will only have a modest impact next year. I think the bigger thing that we're trying to do at breakfast is -- we mentioned a while back, we're doing, I call it, gradual breakfast, where we're opening earlier and serving breakfast items and then continuing those breakfast items for a good part of the day. So we think that given that trend, that we could get a fair number of franchisees to pick up breakfast over time. So the first tranche of that is really in the West next year. So I look at that as a key. If that's successful, then the other parts of the country should be able to go along, because it's not nearly as big an investment than when you're opening up very early for breakfast and have the labor challenge that we've had before. So I think what you'll probably see happening is a gradual roll and a gradual impact on sales.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Farah Fenatore (sic) [Sara Senatore] with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "It's Sara Senatore at Bernstein. So actually, I just wanted to follow up a couple of things that have been touched on already. One was the unit growth outlook in China. Actually, I had sort of been hearing -- I think for a while, we've been hearing this idea that unit growth would -- like the number of units would step up, but the pace of unit growth would slow. But it actually feels like the pace of growth is kind of holding steady, so I wanted to see if anything had changed there. And then the second question was more about back to the inflation issue, which is only that historically most of your inflation, I think, and certainly most the volatility has come from food. So we could be fairly comfortable that your comps would kind of move with that food inflation directionally, generally speaking. Now a lot of it's coming from wages. So is there any concern that it won't be -- the matching won't be quite as good between what you are able to do on the top line and what kind of margin pressure you're seeing on that line item?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Let me do the second question first. I think the inflation piece, the volatility just makes it hard to get the timing exactly right. So I think that to your point, the commodity inflation will probably dictate what happens to quarterly margins. So the labor side of it, to your point, is a structural component. But as you also pointed out -- so we expect that to continue. So we expect high labor inflation to continue, not at the pace we had in the third quarter, but it's going to be at least double-digit. It could even approach the mid-teens, would be our guess over the next couple of years. So we think that's structural, but to your point, we sort of know that's coming, so we could plan our margins and our pricing accordingly for that. It is a commodity thing. It's a harder one to call, and therefore, that's the one that we may get ahead of or behind on over time. In terms of the development part of your question, if you really look at it, it's really hard to predict when do we get the spike in development. But it hasn't been a continual climb. So if you look at what's happened historically, we were about 250 units, and we were at that for a few years. Then we went up to the 350 to 400, and then we quickly went to 500. And then we've been at 500 for a few years now. And so we couldn't call when we would get to the other jump. So what we used to say to your point -- or what I personally used to say is we expect the absolute numbers to go up, but the percentage to go down just because our pace -- our base keeps getting bigger. I think, over time, that's probably still a good generalization, but we have a hard time predicting when the spikes will come. We didn't know that they would do these city clusters. We weren't sure when Pizza Hut dine-in would get more profitable in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. So that's just hard to call. So right now, I feel very pleased we're at a 600 base, and we'll just have to play it by ear from there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "In emerging markets, in general, the comps seem to be very strong, obviously driven by your brand and compelling value. But if we were to drill down to perhaps the relationship between wage rate growth and comps growth, do you find a clear correlation between the 2? And if so, does that maybe make the year-ago comparisons less important when you're thinking about setting your comps targets?", "Richard T. Carucci", "It's a good question. We don't -- I don't know if we have enough data, because you had the spike-up occurred just this year. So we think it's generally unbalanced. It's probably a good thing. In the short term, it's harder because we have to deal with it from a pricing and managing-the-inflation side of it, but it is bringing more people in terms of affordability into our restaurants. And we just don't have the visibility to give you sort of more math around that. So that's just sort of what it looks like at a broad basis.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up. With traffic up so tremendously, are there any capacity issues? It sounds like most of the traffic was probably at breakfast or the increase, which is probably low capacity. But when we think about KFC in particular in China, can you just talk about any capacity constraints whatsoever?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, we had a lot of units. I mean, that's one of the reasons we had units is to make sure we could still provide a great experience to our customers. Breakfast, we were -- we knew we had capacity at breakfast. So we weren't really capacity-constrained there at all. That was a daypart that was light. So we had to bring some more labor in over time. We actually started breakfast a long time ago. So we have still a lot of capacity at breakfast. Our hardest time is still weekends. So our biggest capacity situation are weekends. So, for example, when we did the daypart initiative in China that was a weekday-only lunch initiative, as an example. So that's probably where our biggest bottleneck is. And the way we relieved that bottleneck has been through adding units, and as David's mentioned in the past, we should have really good operations there as well. So we think we're still providing good experience to our customers, and when the lines sort of get too big, we sort of build more units.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a question on YRI. At the company store base, the AUVs were up 35%. I'm just having a little bit of a hard time understanding that against the system comp of, let's say, 3%. So I know that FX and both the Mexico refranchising helped, but they can't account for the whole difference. If you could just help me get a little bit of an understanding of, say, where that AUV growth is coming from. Is it different comps at company stores versus franchise? Is it because most of the new company openings are in France where AUVs are high? And then one quick follow-up to that. Well, I'll come back to the follow-up. Let's start with that.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Keith, it certainly is the portfolio mix issues that we talked on several occasions in the past. France is definitely entering into the mix with the highest average unit volumes. And then also, same-store sales have been stronger this year in company stores.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then the follow-up is, as you refranchise Pizza Hut U.K., whenever this happens, it's roughly 470 units. It's 1/3 of the YRI company store base. As that happens, like, what does this do to company AUVs and margins? Just a general direction or more detail. Whatever you'd be willing to offer would be helpful.", "Richard T. Carucci", "The AUV is probably not as big an impact. Margins will be very favorable, probably about 1.5 points or so. We'll have to give you the math as we get closer to it.", "Operator", "There are no further questions, sir. Do you have any closing remarks?", "David C. Novak", "First of all, I'd like to thank everybody for being on the call. Yum! Brands is going to have another very strong year, achieve at least 12% earnings per share growth. I'd also like to -- today, since this is our founders' week, I'd like to thank all of our shareholders who have been so supportive over the year. We have a number of shareholders who've been with us from the very beginning. So I'd like to thank you for that support. We've done well at Yum! Brands in the past. What has us most excited is about what we can get done in the future. We believe in our business model, we believe in our brands, and our people capability has never been better. So I am very confident that we will be able to continue to deliver. So thank you very much.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

", "On our call today, we will hear from David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Rick Carucci, our CFO. Following remarks from both, we will take your questions. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David C. Novak", "Thank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report each of our divisions produced impressive sales and proper results driving 21% first quarter EPS growth excluding special items. This performance leads us to raise our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12% from our initial guidance of at least 10%. Our international business is clearly the growth engine that drives our company and comprises over 70% of our operating profit. Importantly, over 55% of our operating profit comes from high growth emerging markets. Yum!'s strongest businesses are located where the highest growth is expected to occur in the years ahead. This is a very powerful combination. We also continue to be optimistic about our ability to dramatically improve our U.S. brand positions, consistency and returns. While there is still much work to do, we expect significant progress with our U.S. business this year. ", "Now let me take you through our key strategies. Let's start with China, where our strategy is to build leading brands in every significant category. Operating profit in China grew 14% prior to foreign currency translation. System sales increased 28%, driven by a 17% increase in units and same-store sales growth of 14%. These fantastic results give us even more confidence our category-leading brands are as strong as ever and well positioned for sustained profitable growth ahead. ", "KFC now has 3,819 restaurants, with averaging volumes of $1.7 million in 800 cities throughout the country and continues to expand into new cities, as well as increase its penetration levels in existing markets. KFC is deeply rooted in China with its localized menu and broad appeal. Virtually all KFCs in China serves breakfast, which accounts for about 6% of sales. Nearly half our KFC restaurants offer delivery service and over half have 24-hour operations. These service and day part extensions are all in the early phases of development and provide tremendous growth potential for years to come, as we further leverage our restaurant assets. This is all made possible through world-class operations and is a testament to the tremendous people capability we have in China. ", "Pizza Hut Casual Dining now has 662 restaurants and is opening successfully across multiple tier cities. Its strategy to offer tremendous variety, everyday value and refresh 25% of its menu twice per year has consistently driven sales and profit growth. Our brand positioning as Happy Restaurants with the Western casual dining experience is resonating with consumers and driving success. Pizza Hut is, without a doubt, the #1 Western casual dining brand in China. It's important to note that new unit returns for our 2 leading brands in China, both KFC and Pizza Hut, are the best in our business with cash paybacks within 3 years. We also continue to make progress developing our emerging brands in China. Pizza Hut Home Service now has 136 units in 15 cities; and East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, has 29 restaurants in 8 cities. ", "We're also happy to bring Little Sheep, the leading hot-pot casual dining concept based in China, into the Yum! China portfolio. We acquired Little Sheep in February, and we're looking forward to strengthening its operating model and increasing its market leadership position. We're very excited about the long-term potential of this brand, and we'll make the necessary investments required to ensure its success. ", "Now as you are surely aware, long-term economic trends are also working in our favor in China. Rising incomes are making our brands even more affordable for an increasing number of people, and the consuming class is expected to double over the next 10 years to well over 600 million consumers. With this as an overwhelming macro tailwind, our new unit development will continue at a high rate, and we expect to continue to grow same-store sales. As you know, our long-term model is to grow same-store sales at least 5% as we continue to drive record new unit development. ", "Now moving on to Yum! Restaurants International where our strategy is to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. In the first quarter, we grew operating profit 9% in constant currency. System sales increased 8%, it's driven by net new unit development of 3% and same-store sales growth of 5%. Importantly, 91% of our new units were opened by franchisees. We simply love the franchise business because we generate a steady flow of operating profit growth from franchise fees while our franchisees capitalize the business, which translates to phenomenal returns for Yum! shareholders. We also continue to have strong results in high-growth emerging markets. System sales in emerging markets at Yum! Restaurants International grew 13% and over 60% of our new restaurants were opened in emerging markets. ", "We're especially pleased with our sales performance in Russia. Last year, Russia lead our entire system and same-store sales growth. This continues to be the case so far this year. We're rebranding KFC Rostik's to standalone KFCs and have increased -- and have the increasing confidence we can build a strong profitable business in Russia. ", "We are also driving major growth in the continent of Africa, building up our base of 656 stores in South Africa. We plan to enter several additional African countries in 2012 in addition to expanding our business in South Africa. We expect to have restaurants at about 20 African countries by the end of the year. With over 1 billion people throughout the continent, we know we're just getting started. ", "In addition to our progress in emerging markets, we're making solid progress in France and Germany. Our restaurants in France have the highest average unit volumes in the world for Yum!, and we continue to build our scale and increase television advertising. In fact, we expect to be on television 27 weeks this year, that compares to 7 weeks in 2010. France is also the first market where we're utilizing a business rental program to drive new unit development and returns. And we've taken this approach to Germany, where we should have the necessary scale to use television advertising next year. ", "We have 136 KFCs in France and 77 in Germany today. Our challenge going forward is to secure great sites as fast as our people capability allows. So while France and Germany are certainly developed countries, they are clearly emerging businesses for Yum! brands. These 2 countries are on the ground floor. Today, our business in Western Europe is minimal, but the upside is enormous. McDonald's makes well over $1 billion in these 2 countries alone. ", "Now on to India, our newest division, where we expect to open 100 new units this year. In fact, we're so excited about our prospects in India and its impact on the future growth of Yum! that beginning this quarter, we've broken it out as a separate division. System sales increased 34% in the first quarter due to aggressive new unit development and same-store sales growth of 8%. Even better, our business model is getting stronger every day, working in both large and smaller cities. Our new unit progress with KFC in India is very similar to what we saw in China during its first 10 years. And while we don't anticipate meaningful profit contributions from our India division this year, we are laying the foundation for this business to have a significant impact on Yum!'s profit growth in the future. ", "In the United States, our strategy is to dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. The good news is, we're off to a great start this year with operating profit up 27% in the first quarter. Taco Bell lead the way with 6% same-store sales growth and this should only get better in the second quarter with the historic launch of the Doritos Locos Taco. ", "Initial results from our first meal launch, primarily on the West Coast, have been encouraging, and we're optimistic about expanding breakfast to 200 more stores in the second half of the year and even further in 2013. We're also encouraged by an initiative called Cantina Bell, where we're testing a new line of products with exciting new ingredients like whole black beans, cilantro white rice and corn pepper salsa, inspired by a celebrity chef, Lorena Garcia. This initiative is designed to broaden the appeal of Taco Bell. Obviously, we have a lot going on at Taco Bell, and we're pleased with the progress that we're making. ", "Our U.S. business is clearly in a position to improve upon our 2011 results, and it's really great to see all 3 U.S. brands, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut and KFC growing same-store sales and profit. We realize there is much work to be done, and we expect more consistent performance going forward. ", "Before I wrap up, I want to update you on our biggest people capability initiative. We're in the process of training our RGMs around the world on how to take people with them to drive operational excellence. RGMs are identifying their single biggest thing in their restaurant that can improve operations and using our training guides to develop action plans with their teams to drive results. We recognize that operational excellence is the key to our foundation, and our goal is to make sure we are world class everywhere. This is the single most comprehensive effort we have going on at Yum! Brands that we're adapting and applying around the world. ", "In conclusion, while the year is young, we're very pleased with our great start in each of our businesses. I'm encouraged by the positive momentum we have and confident in raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12%. ", "Now let me hand it over to Rick.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to cover 3 topics: our first quarter results; some items to consider as we look into the balance of 2012; and a brief update on Little Sheep. ", "We simply had an outstanding first quarter. Each division delivered strong sales and profit growth, driving 21% EPS growth, excluding special items. In China, system sales grew 28% driven by impressive new unit development of 17% and same-store sales growth of 14%. Operating profit grew 14% excluding foreign currency translation. Operating profit included $6 million of non-recurring expense in the first quarter related to the acquisition of Little Sheep. Offsetting this, our results were enhanced by the additional day from leap year, which provided about $5 million of incremental operating profit. ", "As we look deeper into our China results, please keep in mind that our first quarter in China is only 2 months long and is heavily impacted by the Chinese New Year. There are several business features associated with the Chinese New Year. First, sales are typically strong around the holiday period. At the same time, consumers are usually a bit less price-sensitive than at other times of the year. And not surprisingly, landlords and retailers pushed to open stores before the holiday period. ", "Restaurant margins in China were a very healthy 23.6% but down 1.5 points versus prior year. These margins were slightly better than our expectations given the high commodity and labor inflation in the quarter. Margins benefited somewhat from the Chinese New Year as the mix of value menu items was below the levels we saw in the preceding months. ", "China development set a new first quarter record with 168 new units. Due to the early timing of the Chinese New Year, over 150 of these units were opened in January. That's just an incredible number, and it highlights the tremendous development in operations capability of the China team. It demonstrates the strong capability of our 900-person development team, both in real estate and construction. ", "Opening 150 units in a month also requires putting 150 new restaurant general managers and 150 restaurant teams in place in a short period of time. Our operations and human resource teams did this seamlessly. I want to thank the China team for this very special Chinese New Year effort. ", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we continue to produce solid sales and profit gains consistent with our ongoing growth model. As David just mentioned, we're constantly improving our competitive position in emerging markets while making significant progress in countries like France and Germany. Our restaurant margins were down 0.6 points. As we continue to execute our ownership strategies within YRI, we expect these margins to improve. In our emerging and strategic markets like Russia and France, we expect our margins to improve as we gain more scale. ", "We will also benefit from the planned refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. Dine-In business. When this refranchising is complete, restaurant margins for Yum! Restaurants International should be in the mid-teens. Let me help put this in perspective. For full-year 2011, our restaurant margins at YRI were 12.4%. If you exclude the Pizza Hut U.K. Dine-In business, the YRI margins would have been 14.7%, an increase of 2.3 points. ", "Finally, as David mentioned, we had strong U.S. performance. Operating profit grew 27% in the first quarter. I was especially encouraged by the fact that each of our U.S. brands delivered same-store sales, profit and margin growth. Russia margins were 14.4% for the quarter, an increase of 3.7 points over prior year. About 3 points of this increase was driven by good old-fashioned same-store sales growth. The bulk of the remaining increase was driven by the impact of refranchising. We currently expect full year 2012 U.S. margin improvement of about 2 points. Bear in mind, this is in a year where we have to overlap fourth quarter margins in 2011 that benefited from the 53rd week. To summarize, we are very, very pleased with our across-the-board strong sales and profit performance in the first quarter of 2012. ", "Now let me provide a brief update on our balance of year outlook for 2012. Although we're off to a strong start and we are pleased with our overall outlook for the year, I do want to share some of the challenges and expectations we have in the balance of 2012. Our expected full year tax rate is about 26% prior to special items. This is almost 2 points higher than our 2011 effective tax rate of 24.2%. Our full year rate of 26% would result in a drag of about 3 points on full year EPS growth. We expect the year-over-year impact on tax to be severe in the second quarter due to the unusually low rate of 16.7% last year. This will materially impact our second quarter EPS growth. ", "Next, I want to provide an update on our China margin expectations. Let me start by discussing our pricing strategy in China as our approach continues to evolve. Historically, our pricing actions have been implemented nationally and all at one time. Going forward, we will take pricing across our system at various levels and at different stages depending on the trade zone. This will allow our team to more effectively monitor the consumer reaction to pricing. ", "In 2011, we had a 3% price increase at the end of January. With the phase in pricing approach, we have a relatively small impact from new pricing in the second quarter. As a result, we will likely see a decline in margins in the second quarter that is somewhat higher than what we saw in the first quarter. However, we are still roughly on track with what we outlined in our December meeting. As you may recall, we estimated that the first quarter margins would be about 2 points below last year. As the year progresses, we expect the combination of our cumulative stage pricing and moderating inflation to result in year-over-year margin improvement of up to 2% in the second half of the year. I'm confident the team will continue to generate annual restaurant margins of about 20%. ", "As we look into the balance of 2012, I believe that this will be another year of improvement to our competitive position and our business model. Our new unit development opportunities are as robust as they have ever been. High return new unit development continues to be the foundation of our growth in China. As I said before, it's a pretty easy decision to pursue capital investments when you have average cash paybacks of less than 3 years. It's even easier when you know how much discipline our China team incorporates into this development project. ", "Our ongoing model does not need the high level of same-store sales growth that we've recently experienced. We expect same-store sales to moderate at some point although it's difficult to tell when that will occur. The important point is during 2012, we are again building up day parts and initiatives that can help drive sales well into the future. ", "For Yum! Restaurants International, our sales results have been mixed in Western Europe, and we expect this to continue at least in the near term. Our focus on our strategic growth markets remains driving profitable new unit development. ", "In the United States, we expect strong second quarter sales at Taco Bell. The first quarter included only a few weeks of the Doritos Locos Taco sales. This has been an enormously successful product introduction and thus far, the second quarter sales of Taco Bell running higher than they were in the first quarter. For the second quarter, we expect same-store sales at Taco Bell to be in the high single digits or low double digits. ", "In our U.S. business, the 53rd week provided $18 million of operating profit benefit in the fourth quarter of 2011. This benefit was offset with higher spending throughout the year, including franchise development incentives and higher-than-normal cost from restaurant closes. While the combined full year impact is modest, the 53rd week will have a significant operating profit headwind for the U.S. in the fourth quarter of this year. It will also negatively impact Yum! Restaurants International operating profit by about $8 million in the fourth quarter. ", "International development continues to be quite strong. We opened 297 new units in the first quarter, and our new unit pipeline is solid. We are expecting to open over 1,500 new international units in 2012, including 800 at Yum! Restaurants International, 100 units in India and at least 600 units in China. This is the key growth driver in 2012 and 2013, and I am encouraged by this pace of development. ", "When we combine all these balance of year factors with our strong first quarter results, we are pleased with how 2012 is shaping up. Therefore, we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12% for the year. Please note that in 2012, we do not expect nearly as large a financial benefit from the combination of ForEx tax and share repurchases that we have had in some previous years. We expect that almost all of our EPS growth in 2012 to be driven by operating performance. ", "The good news is that we're off to a great start. However, it is early in the year, and we know that in a global business like ours, stuff happens. So I'm confident in the strength of our business. My experience tells me that we cannot assume the results like the first quarter will occur throughout the year. ", "Now I want to provide a brief update on Little Sheep. As indicated on our fourth quarter call, with revenue of about $300 million, the Little Sheep business will add about 5% to our revenue base in China this year. In 2011, the Little Sheep business started strong, but struggled in the second half of the year. Operating profit was about $20 million for the full year. We are still in the process of getting our arms around Little Sheep as we transition this business into Yum! China. We will begin reporting Little Sheep numbers in our second quarter results. I want to reiterate, when you take into account transaction and transition costs, we expect only a modest profit benefit, if any, in 2012. However, we remain excited about having Little Sheep in our portfolio, and we believe in the long-term potential of the brand and we'll invest behind its future success. ", "In conclusion, we are happy to start the year on such a positive note, and we expect to have a great year. This gives us even more confidence that 2012 be another year of double-digit EPS growth for our Yum! brand. ", "Back to you, David.", "David C. Novak", "Okay, thank you very much, Rick and Tim. And what we'll do now is we'll open it up for any questions that you have on our business.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So many questions. First, on China. I mean, given your current success of getting units open, I mean, well above, I guess, the plan that was set the year ago. I mean, what is the gating or the mitigating factor that would prevent that unit growth from going up? Availability of real estate? Is it RGM capability of your development team? If you could just talk about what kind of capacity that you have in the system in terms of opening these units, especially as we begin to consider out-year expectations for unit growth in the division?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Let me just start with historically what we've said and what's occurred and then I'll get to what we expect in the future. Historically in China, it's really had to do with economic development and development of trade zones. And again, as we've looked at historic unit counts, they sort of plateaued for a few years, then they sort of jumped up and they plateau and then they've jumped up. It hasn't been a smooth, continuous increase. One of the jump-up years was 2011. And as we sort of said in the December meeting, that's really based largely on the China government 5-year plan and developing the city clusters. And then the other thing that would allow us to raise our number was the success of Pizza Hut Dine-In business. So those 2 factors really let us go from a run rate of 500 to about 650 in 2011. This year we said -- I just said we'd opened at least 600 units. We're obviously off to a great start. So our confidence level is quite high that we'll reach that at least 600-unit target. And it's really hard to predict when those numbers plateau and when they jump, John. I've been at this for a while, and even the China team is -- we have a hard time calling it in advance. What we have said is that our absolute numbers would grow even if our percentage goes down in terms of new units as a percentage of total. Interestingly, the January number was our highest percentage new unit openings in 3 years. So we obviously feel very good about our prospects. So the combination of the economic development plan, the factors that David talked about in his speech, the middle-class continuing to grow, people moving from the country to the cities, all those factors continue to make us very bullish that those numbers will sort of, I'd say, at least stay the same for a period of time, and, hopefully, at some point in the future, we'll have another bump up.", "David C. Novak", "Yes, the only thing I would add to that, John, in terms of long term and our ability to execute, which is always -- is the key, is that when you look at both operations and our development functions, we've got, I think, unparalleled capability not only in China, but I would say of any retailer in the world. When you look at operations, we have a highly educated RGM core. 90% of our restaurant general managers have at least a college education. Over 50% of our team members are students. We have 2 assistant managers in every restaurant ready to become RGMs. And we have over 3,800 KFCs now. We have over 600 Pizza Huts. So that's why we're able to open up all these stores so successfully. We're opening it up with very well-trained RGMs and well-trained teams. And in fact, our operating team in China looks at every store as a training store. So we're constantly developing the talent that can open up these restaurants successfully. Here's an interesting factoid, we've really started what we call a Whampoa Academy, which is our analog for a famous military academy in China where we're developing the -- what we think is the retail talent for China in this next century. We'd basically say the restaurant general managers or kids coming out of school that in 4 years, you can become an RGM, you can become a franchisee potentially for us or you can go work in another retailer and be totally well-trained. Well, in this past year, we hired 10,000 management trainees in 2011. That's going to increase to 15,000 in 2012. So we're really readying for the new store growth that's going to occur. Now I think on the development side, again, we got 1,000 -- Rick said we have over 900 people in our development function. 90% of them, which are based locally, that means they're out in the field, they know the communities, they know the cities, they know the trade areas. And our development managers have averaged being in our company for 8 years. So we've got a really smart, smart team, a great database, and we're establishing new beachheads, 50 to 60 new cities a year. And remember, we have multiple brands. We have KFC, we have Pizza Hut Casual Dining, Pizza Hut Home Services coming on, ultimately, East Dawning coming on, Little Sheep. So we're building the operating and the people capability to, hopefully, be able to accelerate our development over time. And as Rick said, we're obviously off to a great start this year. And I think the thing that I'm most impressed with is that we've got the operating and development capability to keep it going, plus the process and discipline and review processes that really make sure that we get the right sites and the right quality of sites. Each store is reviewed just like the very first stores we opened up in 19 -- whatever the year was, way back 25 years ago. It's approved by local -- the local team plus the RSC. They meet twice monthly. So we got unbelievable rigor around how to really open up great restaurants. So we're very bullish about China's development story in the future. And remember, I've always said this, the real story for China is development. The great thing for us is we got the harmonic convergence of development and same-store sales growth. And we think we're going to have that for some time to come.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And if I may, David, not to take up too much time out of the call, but when you look at China for the last 10 to 15 years, I mean, what opportunities might you have left on the table or maybe you should have done earlier, for example, I mean, whatever it is, of RGM training, of development, of how you're handling the brands and things like delivery, that you could perhaps apply to India in its very early days?", "David C. Novak", "First of all, I think that the China team arguably has done the best job of any retailer in the world. So the good news is, is that I think with Sam Su and the team we have there, we haven't left a whole lot on the table. I think what we've really embraced more fully in the last couple of years, which is, I think, unlocking a lot of transaction growth, same-store sales growth and building our base as we go into the future is that it is an everyday value proposition, making our brand more and more affordable for our customers. And we've always had great affordability, we even -- we're even more so now, and I think that's a huge advantage when you think about us being in the embryonic stages of building categories and building brands. I mean, if you look at McDonald's great success that they had originally, they broke the code when they had $0.15 hamburger. We all had those when we were kids. We're making our brands now as affordable as they can possibly be in China and we're doing it at great margin. It's -- we're building a great brand, building great trial, building the brand the right way. And I think that the good news that we have in India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil, all these places is we now have what we call our emerging market group. They're going to China. In fact, they're going to be in China on June 6, and they're going to be there to really look at the China operating model and take that same model and apply it into those markets. And I know some of you may have had the opportunity to go to India. One of the things and reasons why India is doing so well now with KFC is that Niren Chaudhary and the team there, they spent a ton of time with Sam Su and his team. And I think they're doing a lot of the things that we did in China, great sites, operating capability, all of that is being adapted in India. And I think that China is now beginning to pick up a few things from India as well. So I think it's a great advantage that we have, that we can go to China and have such a stalwart example of how to really execute.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Just to add to that, John, I agree with David. I think when you're looking at a new country, the combination of brand building and unit economics is key. And fortunately, we have both those in India. I think the brand that we're building is KFC brands looking very strong, and we have the unit economics that we've talked about that are strong across the country. I think 2 specific other learnings that they took from China besides the things David talked about, one is that we're going to more cities earlier. I think that traditionally, when open up countries, we concentrate a lot in the capital cities and the biggest cities. And what we learned in China is that there's opportunities in -- when you have 1 billion people in a country, there's opportunities in a lot of cities. So in India, we're going to cities -- outside the major cities quite quickly. And the other thing is the quality of the people. I mean, and that was really from day one in India. But I know you just got back from there, the quality of the people that we have in India, not just at the management level, but the store level, is exceptional. And I know you always get a lot of confidence when you know the consumer is getting a great experience and then you have management that's as talented as we have there.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Rick, you mentioned the first quarter is only 2 months long in China and then 2 weeks of the Chinese New Year being particularly important within that. And I think one of the implications of that is that this quarter is a far from perfect indicator of your business momentum there for good or ill. You have the benefit of seeing 4.5 months of 2012 so far, being able to see through the impact of changing promotions, value menus and whatnot. How would you characterize same-store sales momentum in China from where you sit, and what sort of range of same-store sales growth should we be thinking about for China in this year, 2012?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, as I said coming into the year, I think it's really hard to forecast same-store sales in the year 2012 coming off a year like 2011, which was so strong from a same-store sales perspective. On the positive end, you have momentum. On the negative side, you know you're going to be lapping some big numbers, especially as we get into the second half of the year. And we're not going to give a forecast for the second quarter. What I would say is traditionally, we'd let people know if there's a significant bending in the trend. And we're not sort of saying that there's a huge change in the trend versus what we saw in the first quarter. So we're obviously off to a very good start. I just want to also just keep framing for people that these same-store sales numbers were on top of just huge development numbers in the back, in the fourth quarter of '11 and the first quarter of '12. And I know we're used to sort of saying what are same-store sales, et cetera, but we look at system sales a lot and we've got 2 quarters of just unbelievably strong system sales. So while we obviously care about same-store sales, as David mentioned, we're even more concerned or more encouraged by the development that continues to occur in China. And my expectation is, as I sort of said in the speech, at some point, I expect same-store sales to -- growth to slow down, but I don't know when that will be.", "David C. Novak", "Yes, we really can't predict that. The only thing I think I would just build on this is that we're building a model in China that can incorporate a whole lot more average unit volume growth, okay? Our breakfast daypart is 6% of our business today. It's now national. But it's 6% of our business, okay? We have delivery, home delivery, business delivery, in half of our stores, and we have 24-hour service in half of our stores, all right? Embryonic stages. Value is something that we are doing now with our 6-1 breakfast, 12-1 lunches. So that's all geared towards making our product more affordable to this consuming class that's going to double in the next -- to 600 million people in the next 8 years. And then we're also continuing to innovate with rice and chicken-based dishes that are new and exciting and make us even more locally relevant. So the team is very set on leveraging that asset 24/7, okay? And as we do that, we're at the embryonic phases of those dayparts and new segments. So I don't know when same-store sales growth is going to slow down. I can't predict that any better than Rick, okay? But what I do know is that the new unit opportunity we have is beyond even comprehension, okay? And then the same-store sales growth opportunity is clearly there as we leverage our asset. But our model needs, as we go forward, we want to continue setting records in new unit development, and we need 5% -- about 5% to 6% same-store sales growth. We think that, that's achievable from a long-term model perspective.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Further on China and what's going on over there. The macro is clearly slowing a bit. And you see it in housing, in PMI under 50, in durable goods and things like that. How is it filtering to your business, whether -- I don't mean necessarily just what's the comp look like, but what about behaviors in the restaurants? What are consumers doing differently, if anything? Are you seeing it differently in Tier 1 or 2 versus 3 to 6 cities? Are you seeing it in different dayparts or menu ordering? Kind of what's going on in the restaurants for you over there?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, clearly, given the results we have, we're not seeing much in the restaurants, right? So we had both really strong transaction growth, that 14% growth. I think it was 9% transactions and about 5% tickets. So we had nice balance there. We have not seen a change in attitude. As it's hard to read the macros in China. As we sort of said before, the housing -- they have a housing bubble in China. That is a real concern for people because they are worried about can they afford their house down the road. Some of the other GDP stuff doesn't bother us as much, and we've looked at that stuff. But one of the things that the Chinese government has tried to do is to become more dependent on consumption and make that a bigger part of their economy. It looks like they're being successful in that a higher percentage of the growth this quarter was consumption than past quarters. Confidence of the people had been stagnant for a while. That's actually picking up a little bit. So I'd say that the macro should -- I'd say, for us, the short-term macro stuff is mixed, but probably as much positives as negatives. And as David said in his speech, the long-term macros are still great for us, and that's in terms of being able to add units for a long period of time. So overall, we're actually comfortable with how the China economies performed.", "David C. Novak", "My only point is that when I read all these macro trends and I know that they're out there, and we're on top of them just like everybody else is, I haven't read anything anywhere, from any expert, that says the consuming class is shrinking, okay? And when people are talking about these macro trends, I'm not seeing the same people write about how the growing middle class is going to go from 300 million to 600 million people. This comes from outside sources, that's not Yum! Brands estimate. So I think when you're thinking macro, the overwhelming, the overwhelming macro trend that should affect consumer businesses in China is the fact that there's more consumers, okay? I mean, that's a pretty overwhelming trend. So Michael, I know you got a good consumer goods background, you might want to consider that one.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, Michael, I would just add one thing. There's -- everyone sees the macros from all their economists and whoever they want to source from, but the one thing that I started to look at a little bit more frequently is the performance of our Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, which as you know, has a much higher guest check. And I think that's showing some really amazing things. Obviously, we've done some great things with the concept several years ago, and the brand is a leader by far and the consumer has responded to that. But in Q1, with 19% same-store sales growth, it lapped the 13, which lapped the 13-year before that. So we're talking about 45 points of comp growth over the last 3 years. And the last quarter was the most -- was the strongest. I think that is also somewhat of an indicator of the strength of the consumer in China.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And the increase in the consuming classes is undoubtedly helping you guys, the -- one of the other side of that is the labor inflation side. I just wanted to understand that a little better, especially in light of what will presumably be moderating same-store sales in the future. It's been about -- labor inflation has been about a 200 basis point headwind for your for the last couple of quarters. Might that step up if comps come down to, let's call it, mid or high-single digits in a more normalized environment? Or is there any reason why you might be able to manage that down despite the lower leverage level?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, as we've sort of said before, we sort of see labor inflation as continuing for quite a period of time. And we sort of said when they set up their new 5-year economic plan, we expect that in the mid-teen level. And we just think that's probably going to occur for a period of time. It's actually come down a bit from the high points that we had in the back end of last year. So we think that's a normal occurrence. As we sort of said before, it's a dual-edged sword. We'll get the higher cost that we have to manage. We'll have to pass some of that forward in the form of pricing to consumers. But the consumers have more money to be able to afford our products. And that contributes to the growing middle class that David talked about. So if we look at that, it's just sort of a thing that's going to continue for us. We think it's going to continue for our competitors and everyone else. So we just look at that as sort of part of the background.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.", "Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Understanding that you have a lot of interesting drivers to grow the AUVs across all your units in China, I'm still trying to better understand the comp performance of new units versus maybe more mature units. Are new units rolling into the base at much higher comp rates in the existing base as you build the brand beyond Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, or are you generating these similar double-digit comp trends in stores that have been around for a while given this positive consumer backdrop and your own company-specific initiatives that you continue to implement?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, it's not that easy to figure out, actually. First of all, just for background, again, for some others, our new unit volumes are generally 250,000 to 300,000 below our average unit volumes. And that's been going on for years in China. Now in terms of the rate of growth, on average, our new unit volumes are probably going a bit higher because they have been in the smaller-tier cities and in the central and west, which has been sort of outgrowing the rest of the country. But it's very hard to isolate units because we continue to cannibalize ourselves with new units on top of new units. So in the old days, you could sort of figure that out. Now it's actually extremely complex to figure out. So I think the way I think about it is think about those growth as similar, and that the margins are the same as the existing base. But they're smaller on average unit volumes as you go to, one, smaller-tier cities; and the second, more infill units.", "Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then one more quick one. As far as Pizza Hut in China, trends appear to be accelerating there, definitely saw that in this quarter. I was wondering if you could touch on anything outside of the positive macro backdrop that's maybe taking place at the brand there at Pizza Hut.", "David C. Novak", "Well, I think the big thing we have there that we've talked about in the past is we're changing out the menu every 6 months, 25% of the menu. We've got the value proposition there: Eat like a rich man, eat like a poor man. We have daily half-off specials on entr\u00e9es, which I think is quite successful. We're leveraging the asset. Our afternoon tea time continues to grow. We've brought in new proteins. We're actually selling steak now with the new pan technology, with the display cooking, and that product is doing well. So I think the team is really fully embracing the fact that we want to be the casual dining chain in China with multiple proteins and daypart leverage. So we have afternoon tea time. We will be testing other opportunities to leverage the asset throughout the day as well. So a lot of good news happening there.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird.", "Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I just want to get a better sense of how you think the U.S. profit performance could play out in the balance of the year. And, obviously, a strong profit growth in the quarter you just reported. If I look to the -- the balance of the year and the comparisons for the next 3 quarters, on a combined basis, really looked somewhat similar to what you just cycled in Q1 when you had -- account for the extra week. So my question is, was there anything unique from a profit perspective in Q1? And then as you look to the balance of the year, are you thinking similar type growth of -- similar type rates of profit growth are possible, or how are you thinking about that?", "David C. Novak", "Well, let me repeat a couple of things that I put in my speech just to try to look at what could happen in different quarters. I think first of all, on the second quarter, we mentioned that Taco Bell sales strengthened from the first quarter. So -- now with Taco Bell being a big driver of our U.S. business, we'd expect a pretty strong second quarter in the U.S. And then in the fourth quarter, we have the headwinds from the 53rd week, which was not insignificant. It's $18 million headwind in the fourth quarter. So that will skew what happens from a quarter-by-quarter basis. Obviously, you can't expect to grow 27% every quarter from an operating profit standpoint, but we're pretty bullish on the full year for the U.S. at this point.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with the Hedgeye Risk Management.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "Actually, 2 questions. In the second half, you talked about a 2% improvement in margins in China. What's the same-store sales assumption that you have with that improvement in margins?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, we don't have a specific same-store sales assumption. The biggest impact we sort of said, we expect sales to moderate. But the impact is really -- inflation was very, very high in the third and fourth quarters last year. We got behind from our pricing standpoint. We think this stage pricing will start to have an impact in the second half of the year, plus we expect inflation to moderate in the balance of the year. Again, to put things on perspective on the inflation side, on the commodity side in particular, we said going into the year, we expected 6%. We had 10% in the first quarter. If anything, we're gaining more confidence that 6% is the high end of what we expect from commodity inflation. So we have that benefit plus the cumulative pricing coming in that should help the margin in the second half.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "But you do have an assumption for same-store sales for the back half, correct?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Okay, we just said less than what they were so far, but nothing we're going to share at this point.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "And then another company, consumer company, mentioned that volumes were soft in China because of the cold weather during the Chinese New Year. Would you agree with that statement, or did the weather impact your margins in China during the new year?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, we are rarely weather forecasters, or talk about the weather unless it was extreme. And so we didn't think it was worth calling out.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "One on China comps, and then I promise, one that's somewhere else in the world. But on the China comps, can you talk about the composition of them? In other words, as you cycle the value platform last year, are you seeing incidences off -- ordered off of that volume menu declining, stabilizing? Can you talk about the impact of the non-traditional food at KFC, i.e. the more Chinese-centric food, can you talk about the role that's playing in comp store sales, some way to understand maybe how those 2 elements in particular have played out, and maybe how you think about them for the balance of the year?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, I don't have a great breakdown of the second part of your question in terms of the Chinese food yet. We'll obviously learn more as we get more time into the year. We're obviously very pleased that we have the variety. And we think that's one of the competitive advantages we have in China. So we love the fact that we have the food innovation, but I can't sort of speak to the specific impact that, that's having. Regarding the first part of your question on mix, again, in the fourth quarter -- well, just for background again, we introduced value in sort of towards the end of the first quarter last year and then more heavily in the third quarter last year. That's when you had the biggest shifts. We sort of said at the end of last year, we were sort of low double-digit as a percentage of people offering -- ordering off the value options. That percentage went down fairly significantly around Chinese New Year. Again, as we sort of said, people are less price sensitive. Early indications is it's going back about to the low double-digit range, which is sort of in line with our expectations. But we still have to see how that plays out.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. That's very helpful. And then on the Pizza Hut U.K. sale, you talked about in the notes that you got some bids on the business, and that's what created this revaluation or the charge you took. So is the expectation that you'll sell all of it this year, based on those bids, some of it this year? And then could you just remind us again the size of the business? I know you gave us the margin impact, but what's the absolute dollar size of both revenues and maybe operating profit contribution of that business?", "Richard T. Carucci", "It's not a big operating profit contribution. As we sort of said is when we refranchise, we'll make as much money as we're making today. So it won't be -- it will probably be flat or accretive on the profit standpoint. It's about, I think, 400-something restaurants, 450, in that range. So roughly $0.5 billion of revenue would be the size of it. In terms of expectations, we expect to sell the entire Dine-In business this year. And so we're going through the process now. So we'll see how that plays out. But that's our goal this year, is to complete the sale during 2012.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of John West from Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "It's actually Jason. Just 2 fairly quick ones. One, could you clarify, Rick, on the guidance on U.S. margins, you said about 2 points of improvement this year. Was that for restaurant margin or EBIT margin?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Restaurant margin.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just secondly, going back to India, just the discussion there on sort of the similarities and differences versus your China expansion. I know in China, one of the important competitive advantages you guys have was owning the distribution model, which allowed you to get into the smaller cities a little earlier than others. Can you talk about in India, how you distribute products, is it similar to what you did in China, or is it more traditional kind of third-party partners?", "Richard T. Carucci", "We used third-party partners. Distribution is a challenge in India, so it is something that because of the infrastructure they're not as developed as China was at the same stage of development, it is harder to get product around. Well, that's really just the function of the roads and the infrastructure, not the quality, we believe, of the distributors. So we do use third-party distributors. China is really the only country in the world where we own our own distribution system. We didn't think that was necessary in India.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line Deepa Mochene [ph] with UBS.", "Unknown Analyst", "I have a few questions on Yum! India. Basically, the 8% SSD growth, what will be from transactions and what would be from the ticket group?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I don't know that, Deepa [ph].", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, we can -- we don't have it handy. I can certainly get back to you, if you call me after the call, or e-mail me, I'll get you that information.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, sure. Do you have any idea of what the price increases you have taken in the first quarter in Indian market?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, same thing. Same -- I would say the same thing. Just give me a call or e-mail me after the call, and I will get you that information.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, sure. And another question on the same-store sales growth. Is this 8% growth exceeding your expectations, or is it below your expectations?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, this sounds flippant, and I don't mean it be. As we're in this stage of where we are in India, what we care about is really healthy unit economics, healthy brand and new unit penetration. So we want to make sure that there's not a problem with same-store sales, but that's why we couldn't answer some of your questions, is that we're not as focused in on it at this stage of where we are with development. Honestly, we're happy with -- anything positive at this stage is good.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, sure. And just to follow-up on the same thing actually. The 8% same-store sales growth, I think majority of it would be coming from your KFC business rather than the Pizza Hut business. You can correct me if I'm wrong, but SSD for the Pizza Hut business would be much more lower than the 8%?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, it actually was pretty balanced. I don't know exactly from a first quarter perspective, but the trend across the 3 brands have been solidly positive, that's KFC, Pizza Hut Casual Dining and Pizza Hut Home Service. They've all been running solidly positive same-store sales growth.", "Unknown Analyst", "Okay, sure. And what has been the industry of same-store sales growth, if you have any idea, or QSR in the first quarter?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, we don't. Same thing, I can get you that information. Just send me an e-mail at tim.jerzyk@yum.com.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sara Minotaur (sic) [Senatore] from Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "It's Sara Senatore. I like the last Minotaur though. So, actually, so, one obligatory question on China, and then I wanted to move to a different region. So China, just go back to the line items in the margins. The questions are, one, occupancy costs, again, like those seem to be rising pretty fast and yet even though a lot of your growth is coming in lower cost cities. So just trying to understand that, if that's like sort of an inflationary index that's attached to your rent rate? And the other piece there, is there any part of the labor cost that is a function of how fast you're growing units, like staffing up or redundancy?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, I mean, obviously, there's something there. We've always been increasing units at a pretty high rate though. So the extra unit impact probably had some impact in the first quarter, but nothing we could really measure. We felt it a little bit in the back half of 2011 as well. But I don't have an exact figure to be able to give you on that, Sara.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then the occupancy question?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, I'm just looking at the numbers now.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. So then while as you're looking, if I could ask about Western Europe. I know you mentioned it was mixed. Is that Germany and France where you're growing so aggressively, or are you talking about other markets? And then is it safe to say that's because of the macro environment?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, it includes France and Germany where overall, our results have been pretty good, but you do see, I will use the word choppiness. You'll see some weeks up, some weeks down. That's always a little bit of a troubling sign for us, and more recently that we've seen some weakness there. So the trends in Continental Europe from the same-store sales play have been more negative than positive the last -- over the last month or so. So that's what we're really calling out. Again, for our business there, we still care about the profitable new unit expansion, but it is something that we're keeping an eye on. And on the occupancy side, I have nothing that sort of jumps off the table at us. In general, on occupancy, we are facing -- as a percentage, it didn't really go up. So we felt okay about that. In general, as we renew leases in the top tier cities, we are seeing increases that -- in the occupancy there. But we are getting better mix in terms of more and more of our new units are coming into the lower-tiered cities which is helping go the other direction. This is why the percentage is staying, roughly the same.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions, one is a follow-up on that last one specific to the China margin and the components. I know you mentioned you're still talking about 20% roughly for the full year. We were obviously very impressed by the fact that food costs were down in the first quarter 20 bps despite the 10% inflation. Yet on the labor side, it was up 190 bps on what was, I believe, 17% inflation. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about perhaps the mix changes related to the value menu, or whether there were other initiatives that may have helped the food line and whether you think that kind of even flat or modest leverage is sustainable? I know you talked about kind of a new pricing structure, but if there's any color on that or perhaps what your best guess would be with this strategy in terms of pricing for the rest of the year? And then I have a follow-up.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes. Well, regarding the first quarter, it's exactly what you said, Jeffrey. It was the mix of the value menu was significantly lower in the Chinese New Year period than it was in the months that preceded it. So that's really what allowed us to have the phenomenon you talked about. Going forward, we're not going to have that benefit, but on the flipside, we expect to see lower commodity inflation. So we'll get results that may be not that far away from that, especially as also the pricing comes into play, to your point. So my guess is that the commodity, as a percentage of sales, when you take those into account, it will be modest changes versus 2011.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. In terms of best guess on the pricing front with this kind of new tool, is there any -- at this point in time, based on inflation perhaps easing a little bit and labor you said easing relative to the back half of last year, kind of what you'd think about pricing?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, and I just -- we think we'll -- because if you just sort of do the math, you'd figure roughly similar margins this year as last year when you add it all up, you need a couple of points of pricing to make that work if you look at the overlap from last year. So -- and we're not going to give exactly what we're going to do from a pricing standpoint for competitive reasons, but our strategy has been to lag inflation but then eventually cover most of it. So that's sort of the approach we're taking. And I think this is just sort of a different way of meeting that objective in terms of what we think is just the smarter tactic of doing it.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Understood. And then, Rick, just separately, as you think about kind of longer-term, obviously you got every year to the 10% annual EPS. And I know you talked at your last Analyst Day with your internal models a few points more than that, and obviously you've achieved very consistent growth, what I believe is in the low teens, for the past decade. So I think you mentioned at the analyst day that you'd be surprised if you didn't achieve at least 10% for the next decade, which is obviously a very bullish call on the long-term growth. But I'm just wondering, as you think about the mix components of it, would you think that, that growth rate would inch higher, I would assume with China being a larger percentage of the mix and growing faster, or would you highlight any, perhaps, offsets to limit such an acceleration, whether it be an increase in your investment or other reasons why as the mix shifts to the higher-growth markets that the earnings flow through would similarly shift to the higher teens relative to what you've been running considering the growth trajectory?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, clearly, the mix is a benefit, and that's one thing we've been highlighting for quite a while to your point, Jeffrey. The one mitigating piece I touched briefly in my speech is, we've gotten -- if you add up ForEx tax repurchases, et cetera, we've had pretty large impacts in certain years on those combined. And as you look forward versus if you looked at the average over the last 10 years, I'd expect the impacts of those to be less. So we sort of said going forward in our model, and we even gave a model for 2020, we expect a couple of points from financial strategies going forward. Whereas in the past, they've averaged higher than that.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. But other than that, it wouldn't seem like there will be any impediment, or you wouldn't have any issue with letting more flow through if the mix moves the way we're expecting?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, we're not holding back from our shareholders, Jeffrey, so if it flows, it flows. But our model has been pretty -- it's surprising when you think about how much we've changed. But our model has been pretty consistent as we've looked at it because the mix changes have offset what we talked about on the financial side. And so therefore, our operating profit growth is generally higher than it was before. And we expect that to probably continue. But the EPS impact has been about the same when you add it all up.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.", "Gregory R. Badishkanian - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. Two quick ones. First, what do you think the weather impact was in the U.S.? And then also, obviously, the Dorito Taco Locos had really good momentum. And just based on some of the test markets that they've been in, how long would you expect that momentum to continue, you think through the rest of the year and into next year? What do you think about that?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, I think it's a hard one to call, I mean, the good news is, from our standpoint, that the launch went even better than the test market when -- and I think part of that is the team did a really good job on the social media side. And if anything, we've brought forward consumer, so it's hard to say, therefore, what the lasting impact of that will be. I think -- so I'll let David comment some more. On the weather side, and this is almost a religious thing with us, unless it's extreme, we don't talk about it internally or externally. What I would say is that the industry was pretty strong in the first quarter and that some of that may have been weather related, and some of that could just be the economy was looking better overall. So the industry did improve in the first quarter versus what it was in the quarter before that. So that could be an indication.", "David C. Novak", "I think that Taco Bell has been focused very much on sustainable growth plan for the future. I think as we look at Taco Bell, we take a lot of heart in the fact that our operating capability continues to get better and better. We score in the top tier in our industry on speed of service and accuracy. So that foundation is there and improving. Marketing concept, brand building, we just launched a new advertising campaign to really capture the charismatic appeal we have with the youth target audience with the Live Mas campaign which has been very well-received, very well tested. We think, well, that will get better and better as we go forward. From a product perspective, when we look at the core, this reinvention of the taco with the Frito-Lay, we think we're at the beginning stages with nacho cheese as the first flavor. Obviously, Taco Bell -- I mean, or nacho Doritos has a number of other flavors, we think we can generate innovation on the taco platform. Which frankly, we really hadn't had for 50 years. I mean the taco has been basically the same the last 50 years until we just made this innovation. So now, on our core product, we have a platform that is proprietary and one that we can innovate off of into the future. So that's exciting. The other thing we're doing is we're focused on broadening out the appeal of the brand. We're currently testing Cantina Bell, which is a line of products that was developed by Lorena Garcia. We think this is going to extend the breadth of the appeal of the brand, make us more mainstream with both male and female target audiences. So we think that's very important. And then we're leveraging the asset with breakfast. We're in 800 stores in the West Coast. We're going to add 200 more stores in the second half of the year. We expect breakfast to grow. So that literally -- those are significant platforms that we're working on to grow our business on a sustainable basis. Our goal internally, and I talked a little bit about this, is to add that extra $150,000, $200,000 of sales to Taco Bell and get to 8,000 stores. We think we can be a significant new unit developer in the United States as we improve our unit economics. So that's the goal. This year, we obviously have a lot of ammo that we're firing, and we expect to have an excellent year this year. The real key for us is to build off these platforms that we're developing so we get sustainable growth into the future and get to that -- where we can really get the new unit pipeline going again.", "Operator", "And your next question come from the line of Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Rick, I have a question about the U.S. margins, I mean clearly, this is good number. And I know you said it was largely driven by the same-store sales growth. But thinking about the refranchising and the fact that some of these Taco Bells have not been up to system average, like if you could quantify a little bit more for us maybe what the benefit was from refranchising on the margins year-over-year in this quarter? And then it's really helpful to hear kind of the fully adjusted numbers for YRI, ex U.K. If you were to try to give us something similar for the U.S., if you hit 16% company-owned for Taco Bell and 5% for Pizza Hut and KFC, what might U.S. company restaurant margins look like at the end of that program?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, well, first of all, in terms of the impact of refranchising for this quarter's margin is about a point on a year-over-year basis. And so a lot of the impact from refranchising has already occurred through the -- because we are largely done with Pizza Hut, we're mostly done with KFC, so it's now Taco Bell. And the Taco Bell stuff we're refranchising versus the average margins for our system is a bit lower but not a lot. So I don't expect a lot more impact going forward from refranchising on margins. We'll get a little bit of benefit just as we complete the program, but not a huge amount on a go-forward basis.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Could you talk about the KFC China same-store sales performance? You have 13% versus Pizza Hut up 18%, and whether those check and transaction numbers you gave us are kind of similar across both brands? I guess the question is, why do you think Pizza Hut was so much stronger than KFC?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes, Joe, I think it just comes down to what David talked about Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut, to me, in China, and we don't talk as much about it, but it just had a phenomenal run the last couple of years. I mean, it's added a variety, it's added value. It's just clicking on all cylinders right now. So I would just say it's really the almost extra special performance of Pizza Hut Dine-In as opposed to its fundamental differences somehow between the categories or so forth. Obviously, they play in different categories, but I think it's probably just Pizza Hut performing in an unbelievable level.", "David C. Novak", "I think you got one that's A1 and another one that's A2, okay? But they're both As.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a question on pricing. The 5% check increase in the first quarter, can we assume that, that's mostly price? Actually, it sounds like some of it is mix based on what you've said already. And I didn't understand completely what you were saying about the staging or zoning strategy. Is that going to defer some of the pricing plans in China?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yes, Joe, the pricing that we would have carried into -- or would have had for Q1 would have been the 4 -- approximately 4 that we took last fall, and then half of the 3 from last year. So basically, about 5.5 points of price in Q1.", "Richard T. Carucci", "And just in terms of the -- of what I call the phase-in pricing, I think there's 2 elements to it. One is that there's more differentiation between trade zones. So we're going to increase the number of options that we have by trade zone. And the other is instead of taking one increase everywhere, we're going to take roughly in a number of stages, maybe up to this 5 to 8 range across the country. And we just think that, that's just better from a -- being able to read the customer standpoint, PR perspective, et cetera. So we think that's just the better way to do with.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Rick, when you say 5 to 8 range, is that the number of zones or the pricing?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Sorry, that is the stages it will take us to cover the whole country, basically.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Do you think it would still price mid-single digit for the balance of the year?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, it depends on what happens on the inflation side, et cetera. So as I sort of said at the beginning, we need a few points to get to sort of the margin numbers we talked about.", "Operator", "And your next question coming from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham research.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Many, many of my questions have already been asked and answered, so I'll dig a little deeper and touch on some other things. First on the share repurchase, you did about $78 million in the first quarter. I believe $800 million is the target. Is that still the number to target for 2012?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay, good. Next, on the -- on Africa, you talked about it a lot at the analyst day, obviously, it's a big market. Can you give us a sense just x South Africa, is there any competition whatsoever on -- and when you think about Africa versus when you went into China a long time ago, is it less of a competitive set at that stage of development?", "Richard T. Carucci", "When we first went into China, there was also very little competition. So I guess similar. But no one's even talking about Africa besides us right now that I've seen. So to your point, I think the competitive situation is quite open. It's more challenging because you have multiple countries. But clearly, we think that if we get the political stability and the economic growth that seems to be materializing, it's a great opportunity for us. But as we sort of said before, don't count -- outside of South Africa, don't build that into your growth model the next few years. This is something for our 2020 vision that we sort of talked about.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Great. And lastly on Pizza Hut in the U.S., another strong quarter. Was it driven by the continuation of the dinner boxes? Do you see the category growing as quickly as you're growing? Any context on the renewed Pizza Hut momentum would be great.", "Richard T. Carucci", "We think we outperformed the category by about 1 point or so, I think, in the first quarter. And I don't think there's anything major different than what we've been doing in the past year or so to drive it. The team, I think, has done a very good job off staying relevant with the consumer.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.", "Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Just real quick, food and labor inflation in the U.S., Q1?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, for the full year, we sort of said we'd have commodity inflation of 2% in the U.S. So we ran a little bit higher than that in the first quarter, but we don't think we're going to have much of a difference on the full year number at this stage and...", "Tim Jerzyk", "Inflation is low, low single-digit. But the food inflation is -- definitely will be the highest in Q1 and tail off from that, Bryan.", "Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "And labor, have you seen any changes yet with the economic conditions firming a bit?", "Tim Jerzyk", "No, not really.", "David C. Novak", "Okay, well, I want to thank everybody for being on the call. Let me wrap it up by just saying that while we recognize the year is definitely young, we're definitely please with the great start that we have in all of our businesses. Special kudos to the China team and Taco Bell team. We're really encouraged by the positive momentum we have going forward, and we're confident in raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 12%. And as you know, we're very focused on a track record of consistency, and we're very focused on making this another year where we put another notch up there for us.

Brands. He will be [indiscernible] and will be available for questions. Pat Grismer has been promoted to CFO, replacing Rick. Pat's been with Yum! for 10 years, was previously CFO of Yum! Restaurants International and most recently Yum!'s Chief Planning and Control Officer. Pat will provide comments today, review our financial performance and David will provide comments today on the call as well.", "Now I'll turn the call over to David Novak, our Chairman and CEO.", "David C. Novak", "Thank you very much, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report we generated strong system sales growth at each of our divisions, China, Yum! Restaurants International, in the United States and India. In the second quarter, we did this with robust new unit development and exceptional same-store sales growth. Operating profit increased 8% while EPS growth of 1% was negatively impacted, as expected, by a higher tax rate compared to last year. Our U.S. business increased operating profit 26% in the second quarter and drove our overall operating profit growth. Based on our first half results and solid current sales trends, we reconfirm our full year guidance of at least 12% EPS growth, excluding special items.", "In China, our strategy is to build leading brands in every significant category. System sales increased 27%, or 23% excluding the sales associated with our acquisition of Little Sheep. This increase was driven by an 18% increase in new units and a 10% same-store sales growth. We opened 160 new restaurants in the quarter and are pleased to raise our full year projection for new restaurants in China to at least 700 from our previous guidance of at least 600. And that will be a new record. Despite this extraordinary top line growth, I'm sure you noticed operating profit was down 4% versus last year before foreign currency benefit due to a 4 percentage point decline in restaurant margin. We expect this to be short-lived as our menu initiatives, including pricing, begin to take hold and inflation moderates. As a result, we expect modest margin improvement in the second half of this year and double-digit profit growth. Pat Grismer, our CFO, will be taking you through this in more detail during his remarks.", "There's no question that China economy is slowing and sales for retailers, including us, will likely soften, especially as we overlap such strong performance from last year. We continue to be confident in our strategy of driving affordability to the growing consuming class and is backed by an extremely strong business model, which is driving record new unit development. Now given what we're all reading about the Chinese economy, I'm sure the question on your mind is: What are our expectations for sales growth in the second half of the year in China? As you know, there are 2 components of our system sales growth, new unit development and same-store sales. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to build a record number of new units in China this year. So I think it's safe to say we feel pretty good about our new unit potential continuing to drive substantial growth, not only this year but over the long term. The most compelling stat we have is we only have 4 restaurants per 1 million people in China compared to nearly 60 in the United States. And the consuming class is expected to double to over 600 million people by 2020.", "As for same-store sales growth, our results over the past 6 quarters have been sensational. And we've said to you before, we simply cannot expect this double-digit pace to continue over time, although we do expect to do well. Keep in mind, we'll be overlapping 20% same-store sales growth from the second half of last year. So while it's difficult to call, our expectation is that we should be in the mid-single-digit range as we overlap last year's incredible growth.", "One of the things I'm most still pleased with is that by the end of the year, our average unit volumes will be $1.7 million for KFC and Pizza Hut dine-in. And not only has this number grown 25% over the past 5 years in local currency, but that's on top of doubling the number of restaurants we now have in China. Even more impressive, the top 10% of our restaurants now have volumes of nearly $3 million. So clearly, we have a strong track record of growing same-store sales and units with plenty of room to continue this growth.", "KFC now has 3,917 restaurants in China with average unit volumes of $1.7 million, and continues to expand to new cities, as well as increase its penetration in existing markets. We continue to make progress expanding dayparts and building new sales layers that further leverage these nearly 4,000 KFC assets. Virtually all KFCs in China serve breakfast, which now accounts for 7% of sales, half offer delivery service and over half have 24-hour operations. The good news is we know we're in the early innings with these initiatives and have sales growth ahead.", "Pizza Hut Casual Dining now has 696 restaurants and continues to open successfully, even in the lower-tier cities. Its strategy to offer tremendous variety, everyday value and refresh 25% of its menu twice per year has consistently driven sales and profit growth. In fact, this marks the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. I'd like to congratulate Peter Cowl [ph], our entire -- our Pizza Hut General Manager, and the entire Pizza Hut team for this tremendous accomplishment. Based on how the Pizza Hut team has broaden its appeal, you may have noticed that we are now successfully opening new stores more aggressively including Tier 3, 4 and 5 cities. In fact, we saw a 28% increase in new units this quarter for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. Clearly, Pizza Hut Casual Dining, like KFC, is a power brand in China.", "Importantly, new unit returns for our 2 leading brands in China, both KFC and Pizza Hut, are among the best in our business with cash paybacks within 3 years. We also continue to make progress developing our emerging brands in China. Pizza Hut Home Service now has 139 units and East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand, now has 30 restaurants. We're also in the midst of integrating Little Sheep, the leading hot pot brand in China, into the Yum! portfolio. We obviously acquired Little Sheep to strengthen its operating model and increase its market leadership position.", "I want to point out that results have been soft since before its acquisition and the trend has continued post acquisition. Due in part to the long approval process and transition, we're behind where we expected to be. We are, however, beginning to see sales stabilize. We know this is a powerful brand and we have the expertise to make it even stronger. We have completed management integration into Yum!'s China team and have new initiatives moving through the pipeline. We didn't buy this business for its 400-plus units, we bought this brand for its potential to join Pizza Hut as the unquestionable leaders in casual dining and the potential to open thousands more restaurants. I'm confident our team is taking the necessary steps to build this business for the long term.", "Moving on to Yum! Restaurants International, you may recall that Graham Allan retired from our company late last year. Micky Pant has taken over the reins and is making major headway. We are realigning Yum! Restaurants International, shifting more resources to the field and have organized our know-how building around emerging and developed markets. In fact, Micky and Sam Su, our Yum! Vice Chairman and China CEO, conducted a know-how building seminar which lasted a week in Shanghai for emerging markets, all our general managers in major franchisees that head emerging markets. And this proved to be a great example of how we're leveraging our people capability to make our global brands even stronger. The China model is obviously a winner and we want to spread it across the emerging markets.", "Our strategy at Yum! Restaurants International remains to be to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. System sales increased 7% in the second quarter prior to foreign currency translation. Units increased 3% and overall same-store sales grew 4%, while operating profit increased 6% in the quarter. We continue to produce strong results in YRI\u2019s high-growth emerging markets with system sales growth of 13%, led by 9% same-store sales growth and a 7% increase in units. Our new unit growth potential in emerging markets is arguably the best in retail. With less than 2 restaurants per 1 million people in the world's 10 largest emerging markets, we know we have a long, long runway for future growth.", "We're especially pleased with our sales performance in Russia with system sales growth of 44%, including 32% same-store sales growth, which is the best in our business. Our transition from Rostik's-KFC to standalone KFC is about 90% complete and having a positive impact with our customers as we focus on improving operations and offer compelling value. These results give us even more confidence we can build a strong, profitable business in Russia. Micky Pant, Rick Carucci and I will be traveling to Russia in August and will give you more color on this exciting growth opportunity during our next call.", "In Africa, another of our strategic markets, we continue to drive aggressive expansion throughout the continent. By the end of the year, we expect to be in about 20 African countries with tremendous growth potential. The projected population growth in African countries like Nigeria is staggering, and we're establishing market leadership positions with KFC to capitalize on this opportunity. We expect the vast majority of our growth in Africa to be franchise-driven. We acquired 70 restaurants in South Africa last year to establish brand leadership and help drive franchise expansion across the continent.", "In Western Europe, our brands are significantly underpenetrated. We continue to believe Europe is a significant long-term growth opportunity. We believe this because our restaurants in France have the highest average unit volumes in the world for KFC. We continue to build our scale in increased television advertising. It's no secret that McDonald's has over 2,600 restaurants and makes over $1 billion in France and Germany alone. We only have 218 KFC restaurants and make less than $30 million, so we know there's substantial room to grow into a major business in the years to come. With that said, we struggled in France in the second quarter with a decline in same-store sales of 4%. We remain confident in our strategy and continue to utilize a franchise business rental model to drive new unit development and returns. We've also taken this approach to Germany, where we have an even higher transactions than France and should have the necessary scale to utilize TV advertising next year.", "Clearly, Europe has its challenges, so we expect our third quarter results to be choppy as we go after a much bigger prize for the long term. For YRI overall, operating profit grew 7% in the first half of the year driven by solid sales performance. In the second half of the year, we expect healthy top line growth, improved restaurant margins and less G&A spending versus a year ago to drive improved profit performance.", "In the United States, our strategy is to dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. The good news is we had another great quarter with operating profit up 26%. Taco Bell, our most profitable U.S. brand, led the way with 13% same-store sales growth and the historic launch of Doritos Locos Tacos. We're also excited about the July launch of Cantina Bell with its exciting new ingredients like whole black beans, cilantro, white rice and corn pepper sauce, inspired by celebrity chef Lorena Garcia. This initiative is designed to broaden the appeal of Taco Bell, offering vast casual-type products at 2/3 the price. If you haven't tried these products, you've got to get out and do it. Along with Doritos Locos Tacos, we have made major headway at Taco Bell and are extremely optimistic about the future.", "We continue to make progress with First Meal and plan to have breakfast at Taco Bell nationally by 2014. Greg Creed and his dedicated team and our franchisees are totally committed at taking Taco Bell to new heights and have worked very hard to reignite the power of the brand. A couple of weeks ago, I met with the Taco Bell franchisees at the Top to Top Summit, and they are very enthusiastic about where we're heading and are excited about all the quality upgrades and product innovation that we have and are committed to growing this great brand. Now one thing you should recognize is the launch of Doritos Locos Tacos represents one of the biggest breakthroughs in our industry. In fact, innovations like this don't come along very often. So while there's no question Taco Bell is on its way to having an outstanding year and laying the foundation for the future, we're not counting on double-digit same-store sales growth going forward.", "Now Pizza Hut delivered another solid quarter of results. Its combination of leveraging value, using its $10 large pizzas and bundling complete meals in $10 and $20 boxes with chicken, breadsticks and desserts, this, along with the traditional Pizza Hut pizza innovation, continues to resonate with our consumers. We've also entered the sandwich category with the P'Zolo and continue to innovate with products like the new garlic bread pizza. Scott Bergren, our Pizza Hut CEO, and his entire team are committed to growth, and I'm confident that Pizza Hut will continue to build on its track record and success and drive consistent growth.", "At KFC in the U.S., our business is stabilizing. We're working with our franchisees and profits are improving. Overall, our U.S. business had a strong first half. I'm especially pleased with the strong sales momentum and tremendous innovation at Taco Bell and the sustained growth at Pizza Hut, where we have definitely solved our value equation. I'm confident we're improving our business model in the U.S., but we all understand there's a tremendous amount of work yet to do and we're excited to continue to get after it.", "Now let's talk about our India Division, where our brands are all about the youth and providing an aspirational experience for our customers. We have 479 restaurants in our India Division and expect to open over 100 new units this year. Our business model is getting stronger and stronger every day, working in both large and smaller cities. I just returned from India, and I could not be more excited about our growth prospects with 4 brands, KFC, Pizza Hut Casual Dining, Pizza Hut Home Service and Taco Bell. The brand has gone to school on what makes KFC and Pizza Hut so successful in China, and we're applying these strategies to India. Based on the unit economics we're seeing, we believe there's a compelling reason to put even more capital work at KFC in India.", "Overall, while we're making substantial progress, we don't anticipate meaningful profit contributions from our India Division for the next couple of years. We are laying the foundation for this business to have a significant impact on Yum!'s profit growth in the future. Just like China, we want to have leading brands in every significant category in India.", "In summary, the Yum! business is in very good shape and we look forward to a solid second half and full year EPS growth of at least 12%.", "Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Patrick Grismer", "Thank you, David. Today, I'm going to comment on our second quarter results and our expectations for the second half of the year. Also, with the step change that we've achieved in new unit growth, I'm going to provide some perspective on how we're building momentum in retail development.", "Overall, second quarter financial results were marked by very strong top line performance with a worldwide system sales growth of 8% driving operating profit growth of 7%, excluding the impact of special items and foreign currency. Although EPS was up only 1% on a comparable basis, this was after an expected 10 percentage point impact of lapping last year's unusually low second quarter tax rate of 16.7%.", "In China, we delivered our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit same-store sales growth, an impressive system sales growth of 23%, excluding the impact of our Little Sheep acquisition. This was offset by a 4.1 percentage point decline in restaurant margin and a significant investment in G&A to further extend our unique growth capabilities. For the second quarter and year-to-date, our margin decline in China was driven by persistent high inflation, labor investments to expand our strategic sales layers, like 24-hour operations and delivery and the incremental costs associated with the ramp-up of our restaurant development program.", "Our first half margin of 19.1% was about 1 percentage point lower than we had originally expected, largely due to the manner in which we implemented our pricing actions. As Rick explained on our first quarter call, we've recently adopted a more targeted and strategic approach to our pricing in China to drive everyday affordability for the growing consumer class while achieving about 20% margins over time. To that end, our plan included a phased implementation of price increases, as well as an increase in the number of pricing tiers across the country to better match our pricing to trade area-specific purchasing power and operating costs. While we're confident in this approach, it has taken more time to implement than we expected, and coupled with the restaurant labor investments necessary to enable our increased pace of development, has driven margin below our forecast.", "Clearly, we're not happy with a 4.1 percentage point margin decline in China even though this is short term. However, our pricing is now in place and we look at the process we've used as a responsible investment in the long-term growth of our business. This approach protects our consumer value proposition, supports an accelerated pace of new restaurant openings and helps us to achieve about 20% margins on a sustainable basis. We believe this is a winning long-term strategy. Later on, I'm going to talk about why we expect our China margin will improve modestly in the second half of the year.", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we delivered solid system sales growth of 7% and operating profit growth of 6%, excluding foreign currency translation. Emerging markets continue to be Yum! Restaurants International's growth engine with 9% same-store sales growth and 8% operating profit growth, excluding the impact of foreign currency. In addition to Russia, as David mentioned, we were very happy with the double-digit system sales growth in Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, further demonstrating the strength of our emerging market position. Additionally, over 60% of YRI's new units were opened in emerging markets.", "Despite strong sales overall, YRI's restaurant margin was down 1.1 percentage points in the quarter, driven by temporary cost pressures in Thailand and a same-store sales decline in France, partially offset by improved margin performance at Pizza Hut U.K. From a G&A perspective, YRI decided to restructure for stronger field support. We believe this will position us to grow faster in the long term, but we incurred $5 million of one-time costs in the quarter related to this decision.", "In the U.S., we had very strong performance from each of our brands with operating profit up 26% in the quarter. I was especially encouraged by the fact that each of our U.S. brands delivered same-store sales, margin and profit growth for the second consecutive quarter. Please note that 26% operating profit growth was after the resolution of a California employment lawsuit at Taco Bell, which resulted in a pretax charge of $17 million in the quarter.", "U.S. restaurant margin was a very healthy 17.5% for the quarter, including 19.4% at Taco Bell and 17.8% at Pizza Hut. Our overall increase of 5.8 percentage points over prior year largely resulted from sales leverage, as well as continued progress on supply-chain efficiency. On the latter point, Pizza Hut has led the U.S. system, a recent example being a redesigned pizza box which has not only yielded substantial cost savings, but has reduced environmental impact as well.", "Stepping back and looking at the first half of the year, I'm pleased with the overall quality of our growth as 8% system sales growth prior to foreign currency translation converted to 12% operating profit growth, which in turn drove an 11% increase in EPS prior to special items. Demonstrating the power of Yum!'s portfolio, the temporary margin decline in China was offset by a resurgence in our U.S. business led by outstanding performance at Taco Bell, our largest and most profitable U.S. brand.", "Now I'm going to talk about our expectations for the second half of the year, when we expect our China and YRI businesses will deliver a larger share of our overall earnings growth. In China, while it took longer than we anticipated, we now have our pricing in place. With the significant reduction in food inflation, we anticipate modest year-over-year margin improvement in the second half breaking the pattern of recent margin declines. This is prior to the inclusion of Little Sheep, which could adversely affect our restaurant margin percentage by about 1 percentage point in the third quarter as hot pot sales are seasonally low in the warmer summer months. This margin improvement, combined with healthy same-store sales growth and continued strength in new unit development, will deliver strong double-digit profit growth for China in the second half of the year.", "Looking ahead, we continue to believe our China restaurant margin will sustain around the 20% level over time. Let me take you through the 4 main reasons why we believe this. First, we have the unique ability to grow our business across the entire country with unmatched development resources and a proprietary distribution network. This enables us to increase our mix of higher-margin restaurants located in lower-tier, lower-cost cities, offsetting the lower margins of Tier 1 cities, where rent and labor costs are relatively high. Second, we're growing Pizza Hut Home Service and East Dawning, our emerging brands, which dilute restaurant margin by about 0.5 percentage point today. As we scale these businesses and improve their unit economics, overall margin should benefit. Third, we have potential upside from restaurant productivity initiatives and expect to gain more supply-chain efficiencies over time as we continue to leverage our size. And fourth, we have a strong track record. Consider this: over the past 5 years, our China restaurant margin has averaged a little over 20% with a low of 19% as we drove average unit volumes up by 25% in real terms even as we doubled our restaurant count in an inflationary environment. Taking all these factors together, we're confident that we can achieve and maintain margins of about 20% in China for the foreseeable future.", "At YRI, we expect solid sales growth to continue balance of year. We also expect improved margin performance, accelerated net unit development and more moderate G&A growth in the second half. These factors combined set up YRI for stronger profit growth in the back half of the year. We also plan to complete the refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. business later this year and expect this transaction to be accretive to earnings going forward.", "In the United States, we expect modest profit growth in the third quarter but have a fourth quarter headwind of $18 million as we lapped last year's 53rd week. We expect full year U.S. margin improvement of about 3 percentage points. We also continue to make progress with our refranchising objectives. By the end of this year, we expect our ownership level to be around 5% at Pizza Hut and KFC. We expect to retain a higher ownership level at Taco Bell, but to reduce our current ownership from 22% to about 16% by the end of next year. We believe this will lead to even better results for our shareholders over time. In summary for the full year, we're expecting significant profit growth from each of our divisions, led by strong sales performance across our entire business. And when you add it all together, we expect full year EPS growth of at least 12%, excluding special items.", "Now I want to take a minute and talk about the momentum we're building in new unit development. As you know, our ongoing profit growth model is very much new unit-driven. The good news for our shareholders is that our development pipeline and capability have never been stronger. And because of that, we're now projecting a record 1,700 new international units in 2012. With now 1,000 people on our development team in China, we have unparalleled resources and know-how to take our growth to the next level. As David mentioned, we have raised our China development forecast to at least 700 new units which not only extends our position as the largest and fastest-growing retail developer in China, but also expands the first-mover advantage that has underpinned many years of exceptional growth. When you consider that this equates to opening about 2 company-owned restaurants per day with cash paybacks averaging less than 3 years, you can appreciate the shareholder value created by this extraordinary development program.", "At YRI, which is about 90% franchised, we expect to open about 900 new restaurants this year, over 60% of which will be opened in high-growth emerging markets. This pace of development demonstrates the attractive investment returns that our restaurants offer and reflects the underlying health of our brands in many parts of the world. In India, we're just getting started and expect to open over 100 new restaurants this year, led by equity investments at KFC, where our investment returns have averaged over 20%. With YRI and India combined, we expect to open a record of at least 1,000 new international restaurants this year outside of China.", "Although we tend to focus on our international development opportunity, the fact is that in 2012, we'll also have our highest number of new unit openings in the U.S. since 2002. We've modestly increased net units at Taco Bell for 4 consecutive years and look for the pace of development to increase going forward. At Pizza Hut, 2012 will mark the second consecutive year of net unit growth after a decade of declines as our low-cost delivery carryout units are gaining traction in the system.", "Overall, I'm obviously very pleased with our step change in new unit development. As we said before, there are 3 main drivers of shareholder value: new unit development, same-store sales growth and high returns. As CFO, it's comforting to know that a large portion of our EPS growth is in the ground before we even start each year. And with record new unit development expected this year, we've never felt better about our future growth.", "David, back to you.", "David C. Novak", "Thank you very much, Pat. Appreciate it. So in summary, the Yum! business is in very good shape and we look forward to a solid second half and full year EPS growth of at least 12%. So with that, we'll open it up for any questions that you have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Palmer.", "David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The reason for that profit shortfall in China, it's not the usual one which we generally anticipate would be sales or maybe a food cost spike. You mentioned some reasons, the slower-than-expected pricing rollout, the accelerated unit development and why the margins were down last quarter more than expected. But obviously, The Street is hearing about these reasons more now after the quarter than we heard before. You're giving some comforting guidance and commentary about your margin opportunities in China for the second half and beyond. But the natural question comes back to Yum!'s forecasting ability for that China Division. Have you thought about that and how you can better anticipate your profit performance and communicate that to The Street going forward?", "Richard T. Carucci", "All right. David, why don't I take that since I was the one who gave the previous forecast. China is a pretty difficult business to forecast now than compared to, let's say, 5 years ago. If you go back a long time ago, almost all of our profit growth was generated by new unit development. We could count on cost of sales being pretty stable and us getting synergies in that area, et cetera. So we pretty much were able to grow our bottom line with our top line. If you look at it, there are just more moving pieces today. There's higher labor inflation, a lot more volatility on commodities than there used to be. And probably the only thing I think we missed is we may be missed some of the inefficiencies of going from 500 new units a year to 700 new units a year. So I think we did have some teething problems around new unit development and its impact on operations, and perhaps maybe we could have anticipated better. But whenever you have a high company-owned business, China's 90% company-owned or so, you're going to have volatility when you have same-store sales and cost of sales moving. So I think that -- and then you have an uncertain economic situation to look at there. The piece that we sort of anticipated but maybe not the extent of it is we did know sort of a quarter ago that we were going to have pricing impact. And when we started executing that pricing impact, we just stretched it out a little longer than what we thought at that point last year. And that was just sort of an underground decision based on the reactions that we were getting as we were putting that in place. But as Pat said, those are done now. So from a pricing standpoint, we've pretty much done the lion's share of what's going to impact the balance of the year.", "Patrick Grismer", "And David, the other thing I would add to what Rick has said is that we had effectively guided that margins in the quarter would be down about 3 points. And they were, in fact, down about 4 points, so we missed it by about 1 point. So yes, it was a bit off from what we had indicated. But to Rick's point, the team on the ground is in the best position to read what's happening in the retail environment and to make the right decisions as it relates to how we execute our pricing actions, and then their judgment that made sense and we support them on this to go a little bit slower.", "David C. Novak", "And just the overall strategy, remember, is that what we want to do is to continue to drive affordable accessibility for the growing consumer class. We thought of -- and that's one of the big things that's been driving us. And what I continually tell the team is keep polishing the diamond, okay? We've got great, great brands there, keep making our brands affordable, make sure we have great operations, make sure the assets looks great and the numbers will take care of themselves. And we obviously take a great deal of pride in doing what we say, and I think we have a very good internal forecasting process. And we try to do the very best job we can guiding. And we were off 1 point in China this quarter. But I'm not going to apologize for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Ask about the price increases that you're taking in China, given the timing. It seems like there might be a risk, at least in my mind, to traffic trends if you're taking prices when McDonald's seems to me investing in value, local competitors will have more P&L room for promotions. Given last year's food inflation, consumers are perhaps becoming a little more value-conscious over there. Can you talk about maybe some of the early experiences you've had now with the price increases in place and how you mitigate that risk?", "Patrick Grismer", "Well, Michael, first, as to the extent of pricing that we took, as we said, the pricing was phased in over time. And that was in the low single-digit range, in the range of 3% to 4%. Moreover, the team put a great deal of thought into how and where to take that pricing based on their analysis of purchasing power and cost. And that's why we decided to take it slow. The team is very sensitive to the consumer environment currently and clearly, as David mentioned, is interested in maintaining the strong value position that we offer consumers. So in our judgment, we believe that the amount of pricing that we took was entirely appropriate based on what we've read over time. And so we do not expect that there's going to be an adverse consumer reaction to the amount of pricing that we've recently implemented.", "David C. Novak", "Yes. The last thing the customer is going to see in China is sticker shock, okay? So I think we've done a very prudent job of managing pricing, and again, with the primary objective of being affordable. And I think that continues to be the case, and we're not really concerned about that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just another question on China. You talked, David, about a sort of mid-single-digit expectation on the back half of the year. Just if you could give us any color on how things progressed through the quarter, if you're starting to see some signs of stabilization that gives you comfort with that number. Or are you still seeing consumers tighten their belts and it's unclear when things will stop deteriorating there?", "David C. Novak", "We really don't comment on how we're proceeding during the quarter. I just think that we're very confident in our long-term business model in China. And we think we're making each of our brand stronger this year. And we'll report our numbers out like we always do and not before it.", "Patrick Grismer", "And Jason, the other thing I would add is that I think it's important to look at our comps on a 2-year basis, right? So as David said in his speech a couple of times, as we enter the back half of the year, we are lapping an extraordinary performance, right? Over the back half of last year, same-store sales were about 20%. So with that said and given how we performed in the first half of the year, we stand by our forecast for balance of year. It's single-digits on average.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just to perhaps shift gears to the U.S. business, a two-part question. First, I was wondering whether you can assess how you view the competitive dynamic. It seems like we're seeing a little bit more aggressive value and promotional activity at a couple of your larger burger peers and others. And even in the pizza segment, we're seeing something similar. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the landscape as we look to the back half of the year. And then perhaps as an aside, with people pushing value, I'm just wondering whether you can give us an update on the commodity inflation, perhaps for each segment of '12. I know there's obviously been a spike more recently. And I'm just wondering whether you have confidence in your second half outlook, whether there's any volatility to that or whether the risk is more to '13 from a commodity standpoint?", "Richard T. Carucci", "I'll handle the environment before we get into commodities. I would call the U.S. as sort of in a process of a rocky recovery. So you do see from an industry standpoint, you see sort of a couple of good months and then a bad month and similar from a week-to-week basis. So things are not great and they're not terrible. They're sort of mediocre in terms of the marketplace right now. In terms of our business, I feel pretty good with -- I feel very good about the programs that we have in place. David talked about Pizza Hut, Taco Bell on the call. And if I look at the balance of year for Pizza Hut and KFC in terms of the plans we have in place, I feel good about our ability to be positive in the back part of the year.", "Patrick Grismer", "And Jeffrey, as to your question on inflation, relative to the guidance we provided in New York on full year inflation for each one of our divisions, based on what is happening in commodity markets, what we're currently forecasting is low single-digits inflation in each one of our divisions. And as we mentioned earlier in our remarks, that's one of the reasons why we're confident that we'll see the modest improvement in margins in China in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joe Buckley from Bank of America.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just to follow up on that. So the food cost inflation in China, you're saying the second half of the year will be up low single-digits? Or has it subsided enough as you could see that for the full year?", "Patrick Grismer", "Yes. More on a full year basis, what we're seeing is low single-digits in China. Certainly, it would be close to flat even in the back half of the year for China, including in the fourth quarter the prospect of some deflation, given that we are lapping very high inflation last year.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a couple of other questions on the China margin and some just to clarify what's already said. So do you think the 20% China restaurant-level margin is attainable this year? Or given the shortfall this quarter, will be below that, do you think?", "Patrick Grismer", "It will be very difficult for us to get to 20% this year because of the decline we experienced in Q2. We see that we're going to be in the 19% to 20% range. It's tough to call at this stage, right? But long-term, no doubt about it, we see our way to 20% on a sustainable basis.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then could you comment on the promotional environment there and if that had any impacts on second quarter margin? Was there more discounting or promotional activity year-over-year?", "Patrick Grismer", "That was not a big factor in our margin performance in the second quarter.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one more on the same topic, and then I'll let somebody else go. So is the pricing now -- you mentioned 3% to 4% pricing. Is the pricing up about 6% or so year-over-year? And when do we roll over or lap some additional pricing? I think there might have been something in September of last year, if I'm not mistaken.", "Patrick Grismer", "That's correct. Current pricings, including our most recent actions, is on the order of 7%. There were 2 separate actions taken in the fall of last year, one in September, one in November. So those will roll off as we approach the fourth quarter.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. How much for those? Can you share that?", "Patrick Grismer", "2%.", "Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "2% each [indiscernible]?", "Patrick Grismer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just first following up on that, if pricing is 7%, at least going into the third quarter, are you assuming traffic is positive in the mid-single-digit mix? Or is that not part of that assumption?", "Patrick Grismer", "With respect to transactions, given that we are lapping extraordinary traffic growth in the back half of last year, I would say that the traffic growth will be flat to slightly positive. But that is effectively working in our guidance for now back half of year of mid-single-digits same-store sales growth.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Appreciate the clarification. And can you just help us decompose the labor deleverage this quarter? Because wage inflation was less than quarter, and I know you called out some specifics around both the 24-hour initiative, delivery, as well as the new stores. Is there a way to tease out how much of that is from each of those components? And how much of it is one-time and contained in this quarter? And how much is expected be an ongoing phenomena because those initiatives continue?", "Patrick Grismer", "And John, we normally wouldn't going into that level of detail here. And clearly, it was a contributor to the margin decline in a year-over-year basis. The good news is that we're making this investment to grow these strategic sales layers. So as we roll out more 24-hour operations, as we roll out more delivery in KFC, yes, there's an upfront investment. It's slightly dilutive to our margins. But the important thing is that we're creating the platform for future growth. And also I'm sorry, John, just one last point. As you think about the impact of labor, of course the other big one, which we mentioned on the call, is what happens when you ramp up new unit development. And to the point Rick made before, when you move from a run rate of 500 to 600 new restaurants a year to something north of 700, you have to make an investment in operating capability. And that's been one of the keys to our success in China is that we don't grow ahead of capability. We build the capability first, and then we open the restaurants. And that, what that requires is an investment in restaurant labor so that we have the pipeline of RGMs fully qualified, ready to run these restaurants to our standards.", "John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "What is your -- just last question. What is your expectation of Little Sheep dilution to margin for the full year in China? And I presume that your guidance of 19% to 20% excludes that.", "Patrick Grismer", "That is correct. And thank you for clarifying that. So our guidance on margin excludes the impact of Little Sheep. As we mentioned in the earnings release for the quarter, Little Sheep diluted margins by 0.3%. On a full year basis, in fact it will probably be a bit more than that. I mentioned in my remarks that the impact in Q3 alone could be up to a full percentage point. As to the impact to overall profits, at this stage, we would say that it will have a negligible impact.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.", "Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just 2 quick updates on some bigger-picture issues. First on FX for the year, just given the dollars spent. And then secondly, with the terrific results out of Taco Bell and the margin numbers, is that -- your refranchising, I guess, is that still moving forward? Or is there some thought maybe you want to keep some more of those assets, given the improved performance?", "Patrick Grismer", "I'll take those questions in turn. First on foreign exchange. Reflecting back on what we guided in New York, you may recall that at that time, certainly as I think everybody appreciates, given how volatile the global markets had been, it's really tough to forecast these things. I wish I had that kind of forecasting precision. But back in New York, we said that we expected for the full year China to deliver a $40 million ForEx benefit and YRI to present a $10 million ForEx exposure, so a net of $30 million. Based on what we've experienced halfway through the year and we're currently projecting based on forward rates, China, we believe, is going to deliver a benefit of $25 million, so that's down from the $40 million. And YRI, because of what you just mentioned, the situation with the dollar, YRI will present an exposure of $20 million, so a net of only plus $5 million. So we've gone from plus $30 million to plus $5 million. That is working in our current guidance of at least 12% EPS growth. And secondly, on U.S. refranchising, Rick can comment.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes. No change in the plans. As sort of Pat mentioned, the goal is still to have Taco Bell go from roughly 22% to 16% ownership. And we said we'd do that over a 2- to 3-year period. We're on track towards delivering that. We feel very good, as Pat sort of mentioned, that by the end of the year we'll meet the refranchising target for KFC. So we're making good progress along that front.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions on China. First, I was wondering if you could maybe give us some perspective on what you're seeing in the consumer environment in general. Are you noticing any behavioral shifts or regional changes in demand? And maybe compare the slowdown that we're experiencing over there to what you've seen previously when the economy softened a bit.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Why don't I take that just from a historical context and Pat may want to add to it. Is that we always have a hard time in that part of the world, where when China slows down, they still have pretty strong GDP growth by our standards. But to your point that the consumers do get more cautious, so we are starting to see more sales at retailers in China. We probably expect that to continue as we go over time discounting. And we expect probably that could make it necessary to continue to provide the value that David talked about in terms of our approach to China. But the thing that's so -- if you look at consumers -- we do think they're going to get a bit more cautious. The biggest trends that we continue to see, and this was probably a bit magnified in the first part of this year, is Tier 1 cities are growing at a slower rate. And as you look at Tier 1 and Tier 2 and probably coastal cities, because exports appear to be slowing, they'll probably be hit harder. So one thing we feel fortunate about is the new unit development that Pat took us through, we're doing very well -- continue to do very well in Tier 3 through 6 cities. And those are generally performing at a higher rate. And right now, it's also higher same-store sales in those areas.", "Patrick Grismer", "David, the other thing I would add -- and I'm sure you read the same economic reports that we do. And of course, recently it was announced that GDP in China have slowed from 8.1% to 7.6%. But remarkably, consumer spending rose as a percentage of overall growth from what was 47% of GDP growth last year in the first half to 58% in the first half of this year. So broadly, the extent to which consumer spending is contributing to the growth of the economy is improving and certainly, that works in our favor.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe one follow-up related to the step-up in unit growth. Could you maybe just talk about your confidence in ramping up the pace there? And maybe is some of the incremental openings really focused on those Tier 3 through 6 cities? Or is it more broad-based across the country?", "Patrick Grismer", "Well, as I said in my remarks, we have an extraordinary development team in China that numbers roughly 1,000 people. And that capability is unmatched and is a competitive advantage for us and gives us the ability to drive to a new level of unit development. And as I mentioned, one of the reasons why China G&A is up, I think it's 23% on the quarter, is in part because of the investment, the significant investment we're making in this growth capability. And that gives us a lot of confidence to sustain this high rate of new unit development. As to the distribution of these new units across tiers, over the last few years, and this will continue into the future, we're seeing more of a skewing of our development toward those lower-tiered cities, where we have unique presence and capability. And that works in our advantage, as I mentioned, from a margin perspective because it is in those lower-tier cities that we have more favorable cost structures that allow us to generate higher margins and better returns.", "Operator", "Next question is from Howard Penney with Hedgeye Management.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "I was wondering if you could articulate the thought behind the acceleration and growth in China. Back at the analyst meeting in New York, you sort of articulated the thought process that you would have incremental growth coming from other regions of the world to be able to hit 10%. So is the acceleration in China allowing you to complete that 10% growth rate? Or are there other macro factors or competitive factors that are leading you to accelerate the growth rate in China?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Well, just going back to December, I think that the biggest thing that occurred was the Chinese economic plan and the infrastructure development getting accelerated. And we talked about those cluster cities. And so a lot of new railroads, airports and then malls associated with those places have been sprouting up, and we've going in into those. And those are probably places that we didn't expect to have a couple of years ago. And then the other big part of the increase has just been, as David talked about, the great performance in Pizza Hut, and Pizza Hut also being able to be successful in the below Tier 2 cities. So those are the 2 biggest drivers that we're leveraging, and that's in -- as you know, if we went back 3 years ago, we wouldn't have anticipated that we would've hit these levels this quickly. And there was some teething pains associated with that from a profit standpoint, but we're obviously delighted that the number was able to reach what it reached so far. So we're not looking forward to accelerate beyond that.", "Patrick Grismer", "And Howard, just as a reminder, as we mentioned, when you look at our international development outside of China, so taking YRI and India together, we're now projecting gross builds of at least 1,000, which again is a record for Yum!.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "And still is the notion that there's an increased competitive presence in China not part of the process?", "Richard T. Carucci", "Yes. Well, I think that the competitive nature in China is definitely higher in the Tier 1 cities. In the rest of China, I think as I sort of said before or we said on different occasions, I think our competitive position has actually improved because we're getting more and more units into these smaller-tier cities before anybody -- national chains, Chinese or Western, are able to get there. So it's a different dynamic by location. So definitely to your point, Howard, I think the Tier 1 cities and even the Tier 2 cities are starting to get more competitive. But we really haven't seen that in the lower-tiered places.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "And will this make it harder for the competition to grow in those lower-tiered cities?", "Richard T. Carucci", "That's our hope.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.", "Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I'd like to move to the labor situation in China. Intrigued with the high rate of wage inflation, I'm wondering if that's doing anything to turnover. Are people being lured away to higher-paying jobs in other fields and turnover's rising, and so replacement and training costs are rising? Or are we able to sustain the historical turnover rates and just having to meet the market on wage increases for existing workers? And also whether it's more difficult to hire maybe potential managers in the high wage inflation environment?", "David C. Novak", "First of all, I think that the -- our ability to hire and retain talent in China is renowned. I mean, we have outstanding operating capability there. In fact, we've recently created what we call Whampoa. It's our training academy for the entire retail industry. Basically, we're bringing in management recruits out of college, telling them that within 4 years they can become a restaurant general manager, potentially a franchisee inside of our company. And if they want to move on and move into another industry, they can be well trained and perfectly prepared to go into retail, opening up many, many different careers. So we hired thousands of management recruits this past year and we think that our goal with operations is to have KFC be the operating mecca for talent not only for ourselves, but the rest of the industry. Just like, I think historically in marketing, P&G has been the marketing training ground for lots of talent. So we have -- today when you look at our RGMs, 90% of our RGMs are at least college graduates. And we see that number actually edging up over time. The quality of our jobs, the perception of our jobs is very, very high in China. Now consider this, these people are running $1.7 million businesses. They have up to 100 employees, okay? They have huge general manager responsibilities and they're being very competitively paid. And we have a culture that is, I think, very, very highly regarded and respected in the country. One of the things that's interesting, I was in -- I gave a speech in Shanghai at Fudan University. And they had 300 seats. There were 600 people in the auditorium. They were literally packing the aisles and almost sitting on top of each other. And the dean of the business school asked, \"How many of you have been to KFC or a Pizza Hut in the last week, okay?\" Everybody raised their hand. And our ability to build great brands is very highly respected in China, and so we think -- the thing that I'm most pleased about is that we continue to build operating capability. It's that operating capability that's allowing us to open up all the restaurants and continue to get the great return. So I think the ability to attract and retain talent is probably -- well, we've voiced out our operations was our the biggest competitive advantage and I think it is today, that along with the local team that understands how to really build brands. But the operating capability is something we're very confident and we will never ever take our eyes off of it because we know that people capabilities is the key to getting great returns for the long term.", "Bryan C. Elliott - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "How about on the hourly side, crew side?", "David C. Novak", "We're not seeing any real impact, one way or the other on turnover.", "Patrick Grismer", "And just to build on that, Brian, one of the things that we -- we think our best part-time laborers in China are college students, and the percentage of college students have actually been rising over time.", "David C. Novak", "I think over 50% now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Siegner with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Goes out to either Pat or Rick. Just one last thing on China margins, just to maybe ask it at a slightly different way. You answered one of the questions or saying maybe one of the things that you missed were inefficiencies of accelerating the pace of unit openings. So just at the highest level, and maybe for 2Q and the full year 2012, what is the basis point impact on China restaurant level margins from that acceleration of unit growth? Like what was the drag on 2Q? And what do you anticipate the full 2012 drag to be from that acceleration?", "Patrick Grismer", "Yes. Keith, it was about 1 point in the quarter, and that's what we're expecting for the year.", "Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Even though fourth quarter, you'll start to lap against a really accelerated pace of unit openings last year. I would think the pressure might get a little easier as the year progresses.", "Patrick Grismer", "I'm not calling it on the quarter in terms of our outlook. But in Q2, the impact was about 1 point. And as we look at the year, we would say it's about 1 point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "On China first, regarding labor, should we just continue -- should we continue to expect double-digit wage rate growth for the foreseeable future?", "Patrick Grismer", "Yes.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And just a couple of other questions, most of my China questions have been answered. In the U.S., I think you mentioned modest third quarter profit growth. Can you discuss that? Does it have to do with any change in the top line trend? Or is it more on the cost side? If you can explain that, given a great profit growth quarter in the second quarter.", "Richard T. Carucci", "Just let me clarify. I was answering a question, I thought, about sales growth, so what I sort of said -- they asked about the environment for sales, and we just sort of said we expect positive sales for the KFC and Pizza Hut brands combined for the balance of the year, that we didn't think the environment is going to cause anything out there. I don't think we gave a profit outlook by quarter.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "I thought in the prepared remarks, it was talking about modest profit growth in the U.S. in the third quarter. Did I misread that?", "Patrick Grismer", "Yes, that is correct. But when we look at the full back half of the year, given the headwind we're facing with the lap of the 53rd week, we wouldn't say that it's modest for the back half. It's more of a third quarter phenomenon as we expect that the sales growth will temper a bit from what we've seen in the first half of the year, low single-digits.", "Mitchell J. Speiser - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. And on YRI, in the press release, it mentioned that emerging market comps were up over 9 -- about 9%, which sounds particularly strong. Can you give us a sense -- given that you have given guidance in the other regions, do you expect that emerging market comp growth to continue at a similar rate?", "Patrick Grismer", "Generally, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.", "Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "It sounds like the China topic has been exhausted, so I wanted to ask about YRI and the sort of the company margins expectation for improved performance in the back half. I know you talked about more moderate G&A growth and accelerated net unit development. And I can see why that should support faster growth. But can you just talk a little bit about what exactly went on with the restaurant margins? And is the expectation that things get better, does that embed the fact that the refranchising the U.K. business would automatically just give you back, I think, 200 basis points to margins?", "Patrick Grismer", "Yes. Sara, first to clarify, our forecast of improved margins for YRI in the back half of the year does not assume the benefit of the Pizza Hut U.K. refranchising. When we complete that transaction, as you mentioned, we expect about a 200 basis point improvement to YRI's margins overall. As to why we believe the situation is going to improve, it's important to recognize that in the second quarter, a key contributor to the decline was that we had a spike, a temporary spike in costs in Thailand at a time we were lapping quite extraordinary margins on Thailand. Thailand margins overall are very good, but it just so happens that given the timing of certain expenses including an increase in some wage rates that we took more of a hit in the second quarter. We see the situation for YRI overall in the back half of the year moderating where there's less pressure from unusual cost increases like this. That, combined with ongoing momentum in our productivity initiatives and what we expect we will see from same-store sales leverage, leads us to have confidence that we'll see an improved margin performance from YRI in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "David, you said something interesting in an answer to your question about a manager potentially becoming a franchisee in China. I mean could you, I mean, elaborate a little bit that on what you meant? And secondly on a completely different direction, the credit markets seem to be in very, very good shape for a company like yours. And your debt to EBITDA and debt to free cash flow are at levels that probably people couldn't have imagined 10 years ago. So kind of looking at opportunities that may be presenting themselves, you have your new CFO, maybe have some different ideas in terms of what the capital structure could be, to what extent could you use the debt side of the balance sheet to enhance equity returns?", "David C. Novak", "Let me talk about first about the China franchise -- well first of all, in China, we are and will continue be predominantly company-owned. However, we are doing franchising on a limited basis and we're doing it more on a single-store owner basis, and we've been -- one of the things that we've been experimenting with and executing to a certain extent is taking great restaurant operators in our company and giving them the opportunity to run restaurants in China. So we think that, that will continue to be the case as we get bigger and bigger and bigger, especially across the number of different concept areas that we're in. And I'll turn to my new CFO to give you some perspective on our capital structure.", "Patrick Grismer", "And as to our capital structure, I would say that we're happy with where we're at now and how we've managed it over time because we've gotten extraordinary results. We continue to take a look at what's happening in the market and what might make sense for us and for our shareholders. And so we'll continue to do that and apply the same good discipline we have for the last several years. So no changes anticipated at this stage, but we do continue to look at it.", "John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And if I may ask a question, like why wouldn't there be more debt on -- I mean, just asking a little bit, being more directly, why wouldn't there be more debt on your balance sheet at this point?", "Tim Jerzyk", "John, you've got to keep in mind, we talked about this. You've got to keep in mind everyday when we're building basically 2 new stores a day in China, most of them -- virtually all of them are leased. So we're adding leverage to our balance sheet in the minds of the rating agencies every day. So you got to keep -- they look at it from the full perspective, they capitalize the leases. So when you look at that, you've got to keep that in mind even though the balance sheet debt may look low, they definitely take that into account. And as we said previously, we had -- we were BBB- .And I think we're still BBB- with one of the agencies. We want to be BBB solid after the financial crisis. We felt like having another little bit more margin of safety was important. And that's basically where we are kind of but we're not quite yet with all 3 of them. So as much as some people would like us to add debt, we feel good about where we are, given what we've learned over the last few years, as Pat said.", "David C. Novak", "I think the important point here that you bring up, which we take a great deal of pride in, is that we are a dramatically different company, as you point out, than we were 10 years ago and that we have the ability to invest tremendously behind the core growth of our business, which is our #1 priority. We are able to buy back stock and we're able to pay a good dividend. And our ability to do all 3 of those things has only gotten better. And I think that's what I think is exciting as we think about the tremendous growth prospects we have ahead.", "Okay. With that, I'd like to wrap it up, thank all of you for being on the call. As I said before, and I think it's a good summary of where we've been. The Yum! business is in very good shape, and we look forward to a solid second half and a full year EPS growth of at least 12%.

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions)", "Thank you.

Following remarks from each, we will take your questions.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak", "Thank you very much Tim and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter performance, I think it\u2019s important to note this past Sunday, October 7th marked our 15th anniversary as a company. From the very beginning, our formula for success has been people capability first, satisfied customers and profitability follow; I am proud of how we went to get our ownership culture we\u2019ve developed and pleased with the strong returns we\u2019ve generated for our shareholders.", "As we look back over the past 15 years, we take satisfaction by what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish, but as you\u2019ll hear more about today, we\u2019re even more excited about the unfinished business that lies ahead. When we started our company, we benchmarked high performing companies and all were known for their consistent double-digit annual EPS growth. As a result, we built our company around the objective of delivering dynasty like performance of at least 10% annual EPS growth. We just raised our guidance and we expect that 2012 will mark the 11th consecutive year we deliver at least 13% EPS growth before special items.", "As you know, there are three keys to driving shareholder value in retail; new unit development, same-store sales growth and high returns. Our new unit opportunity in China is the best in retail and our opportunity to expand is now bigger than ever throughout the emerging markets. As I said before, Yum! Brands is about China and so much more.", "As evidenced about 60% of our profit is generated in emerging markets which is where the real economic growth in the world is occurring today. This growth, combined with the facts that we have powerful global brands and only two restaurants per million people in emerging markets compared with 58 restaurants per million people in the U.S. gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion.", "Further, I would not trade our opportunity to grow same-store sales with anyone. We have 38,000 restaurants with underutilized assets. We are laying the foundation for more substantial same-store sales growth by developing breakfast, beverages and broad and improved asset utilization overtime. Meanwhile, our returns continue to be among the best in the restaurant industry with return on invested capital over 22%.", "These facts give us confidence that our business model deliver strong results in even the most challenging economic times; unlike most companies, we don't have to look for growth, it\u2019s staring us right in the face everyday and we expect this opportunity will allow us to build on our track record of at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2013 and well into the future.", "Now on to our results; I am pleased to report each of our divisions produced strong sales and profit results driving 19% EPS growth prior to special items. Given the strength of our year-to-date results, as I just mentioned, we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 13% excluding special items. We expect to open a record 1,750 plus new international units this year, including over 750 new units in China. That\u2019s two new restaurants per day in China and nearly five new restaurants per day around the world.", "Equally important, we have same-store sales growth across our divisions. This combination of record new unit development and strong same-store sales growths has delivered high quality earnings this year and gives us even more confidence in delivering a strong 2013 as well.", "Now let me take you through our key strategies in China and India and then Rick will take you through our strategies at Yum! Restaurants International in the United States; Pat Grismer will then review our financial progress.", "I am obviously very proud of our China team\u2019s continued strong performance. For the third quarter, operating profit grew 22% prior to foreign currency translations. Units expanded 18% and system sales grew 22%. And importantly, and as we predicted, restaurant level margins improved dramatically compared to our second quarter.", "Same-store sales grew at a healthy rate of 6% with transactions down 1%. Keep in mind this is overlapping 19% same-stores sales growth with transaction growth of 27% during the third quarter of last year. When you do the math, our two year same-store sales growth is an impressive 26% with two year same-stores transaction growth of 26% as well.", "What makes this even more impressive is that we\u2019re driving record new unit development at the same time. We\u2019re excited that the China team is going to open over 750 new restaurants this year. Our new unit returns in China remained the best in our business. We know we are building shareholder value with cash paybacks less than three years.", "However you should know that my number one challenge to the team is to never build faster than our people capabilities. Fortunately, as our scale grows in China, our people capability continues to get even stronger. We hired 10,000 new management trainees over the past year through our Whampoa Academy, and currently have 2,000 assistant managers in our system today who are ready to become restaurant general managers and continue to build on a reputation for operational excellence. Our focus on people capability first is alive and well in China.", "Now let me share with you a few highlights from each of our leading brands in China. Let\u2019s start with KFC, the largest western QSR concept in China. Our first KFC restaurant opened in China in 1987. So we\u2019ve been in China for 25 years now. I am proud to say that we recently opened our 4,000 KFC restaurants.", "It took 17 years to open our first 1,000 restaurants but only two years to open our most recent 1000. We continue to expand our unit advantage over our nearest competitor and we're growing in both large and smaller cities throughout the country. ", "We're acquiring the premier sites in the most vibrant trade zones and we're using our assets throughout the day with breakfast, delivery and 24 hour operations. Our new fast food business model balances great tasting food with high quality service and speed. We offer a balanced menu across multiple proteins and day parts and promote healthy lifestyles as well as focus on being rooted in China with continuous innovation. ", "We constantly monitor key consumer metrics and continue to win with Chinese consumers. Now all of this success is underpinned by world-class operations and outstanding people capabilities. Having said this, the most exciting new news in the past couple of years has been the tremendous growth and vibrancy of the Pizza brand. ", "Pizza Casual Dining goes beyond Pizza and continues to unquestionably be the leading western casual dining concept in China with over 700 units in 120 cities. The Pizza menu is revamped twice a year and continues to offer a broad variety of entrees including beef, chicken and rice dishes along with appetizers, beverages and deserts. ", "We're having tremendous success building a true western casual dining concept with everyday affordable value. In fact, our new unit returns are at least equal to the fantastic returns for KFC and we expect to open over 150 Pizza Casual Dining restaurants this year. We are especially pleased to be opening Pizza Huts not only in the largest cities but in Tier three, four and five cities as well where there is nearly one billion people.", "We also continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut Home Service and the Home Delivery category now has a 140 units in 14 cities. East Dawning, our Chinese fast food brand now has 28 restaurants.", "We continue to make progress as we drive for scalable economics with both of these concepts. As you know, we acquired Little Sheep China\u2019s leading hot pot concept in February of this year. We acquired Little Sheep to strengthen net operating model and increase its market leadership position. ", "We know this is a powerful brand and we have the expertise to make it even stronger. We have completed management integration in the Yum!\u2019s China team and have new initiatives moving through the pipeline. We didn\u2019t buy this business for it\u2019s 400 plus units, we bought this brand for its potential for 1000\u2019s of restaurant. Let me assure you our long-term belief in this brand continues to be very high.", "In summary, our China business is having another strong year. But as I said before, China is going to have its inevitable ups and downs. And like I said last quarter, we now face a slowing economy. But that doesn\u2019t change our long-term outlook in China one iota. Our annual performance has been pretty consistent and I expect this to continue. ", "The progress we\u2019re making in executing our China strategy to build leading brands in every significant restaurant category is exceptional. And we\u2019re confident in our ability to deliver strong growth in 2013 and beyond.", "Now let\u2019s talk about our India division where our brands are all about the youth and providing an aspirational experience. We have 495 restaurants in our India division and expect to open 100 new restaurants this year. Our KFC business model is getting stronger, working both large and smaller cities.", "The team has gone to (inaudible) on what makes KFC so successful in China and we are applying these strategies to India. Based on the unit economics we are seeing, we believe there is a compelling reason to put even more capital to work at KFC in China and India excuse me. We are laying the foundation for this business to have leading brands in every significant category in India including KFC, Pizza Casual Dining, Pizza Hut Home Service, and Taco Bell. We expect this business to have a substantial impact on Yum!'s profit growth in the future. ", "Now let me hand it over to Rick, who is going to give you an update on Yum! Restaurants International and our US business.", "Rick Carucci", "Thank you, David. Let me start this morning with Yum! Restaurant International which is perhaps the most under appreciated piece of Yum! YRI has a great business portfolio. There are tremendous development opportunities in emerging and underdeveloped markets and over 85% of YRI\u2019s 14,000 restaurants or franchise.", "This combination creates a steady stream of franchise royalties and strong growth. For the quarter, YRI delivered system sales growth of 4% and operating profit growth of 14% prior to foreign currency translation. Same store sales increased 2% led by a 5% increase in emerging markets. These YRI same-store sales were negatively impacted by about one point due to calendar shift of Ramadan into the third quarter of 2012. ", "With the results we have seen so far this year, we are well on our way to build 900 new units in 2012. While Yum! Restaurant International has tremendous growth opportunities in many parts of the world. I am going to spend some time today talking about the roles of four markets, France, Germany and Russia as well as the African continent. ", "First let me put France, Germany and Russia into perspective. In these three countries combined, McDonalds has about 2,900 units and makes well over a $1 billion in profits. Last year in these countries YRI had 383 restaurants that made less than $30 million in profits. So we know we have a tremendous runway for growth. In France, we have 143 restaurants, we are on the air with national television advertising and we have the highest KFC average unit volumes in the world.", "We are using a business rental program which we patterned after the successful model used in France by McDonalds. This approach combined with the strong KFC consumer proposition is driving disciplined unit growth. We are making significant progress building a profitable business in France and we are using a similar approach in Germany.", "I recently visited Germany where we now have 81 KFC\u2019s. I saw that KFC is leveraging especially prepared chicken to differentiate itself on food quality. The German team and franchisees are really excited because we have the scale necessary now to begin national advertising in 2013.", "David, Pat and I were also able to see our Russia business in person in August. We all came away amazed at the breakthrough progress [Olympus], Rob and his team are making. Two years ago, our restaurants in Russia were all franchise. They were only sub-brands of these KFC\u2019s. They had average unit volumes of about $1.2 million. ", "Well, in the past two years, Russia has had the highest KFC same-store sales growth in the world. So as we sit here today, we now have a 180 KFC\u2019s averaging $1.8 million. The team has improved operations in brand marketing and has converted almost 100% of the system to standalone KFC\u2019s.", "We attended Restaurant General Manager Conference in Moscow where we met many talented and committed RGMs. McDonalds has a tremendous business in Russia, so we know we have a long way to go. However, after seeing how our KFC brand is evolving and the quality of our team, we left with even more confidence about our growth prospects in Russia and our ability to build a very strong business there.", "The last YRI market I would like to highlight is Africa, and as you think about Africa in several pieces. We have a very robust business in South Africa with 650 KFC\u2019s we\u2019re clearly the market leader. We have also been expecting to be in 17 African countries outside of South Africa by the end of 2012 including Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana.", "Our primary objective is to build people capability, infrastructure and scaling these countries. We do not expect them to add significantly to our profit results in the next several years. However, we are very pleased that we have started the journey in this part of Africa. With over 1 billion people, Africa can be a very significant business for Yum! and we are proud to be the restaurant leader on this continent.", "We generated about $50 million of profit from South Africa last year. So if you include France, Germany and Russia and South Africa, we made less than a $100 million in these markets combined. However, these four markets have impressive short-term and long-term growth potential. Together they have the ability to generate up to half of YRI\u2019s 10% targeted profit growth over the next four years.", "Overall, the Yum! Restaurants International business is on-track. We are having a strong year in 2012 and we believe we are well positioned for future success. Our strategy remains to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere.", "Now on to our U.S. business where our ongoing goal has been to improve our brand positions, consistency and returns. Same-store sales were up 6% in the third quarter and year-to-date. In the third quarter, operating profits grew 13% and is up 22% year-to-date. We have structured the U.S. business for more consistent returns and are putting the building blocks in place to build more powerful brands and to sustain our performance going forward.", "Back in 2008, we began reducing our company ownership levels in the U.S. By the end of this year, we have taken our company-owned restaurants from 3,900 to less than 1,700 therefore cutting our equity units by more than half. We have put our restaurants in the hands of capable franchisees while improving our return on capital in the U.S. business by about four points.", "We have essentially completed our KFC and Pizza re-franchising. We began one modest re-franchising of Taco Bell restaurants last year although our U.S. ownership will remain skewed towards Taco Bell. We expect to reach our target ownership levels by the end of 2013. At that time, our U.S. company mix will be about 10% compared to the 22% mix we had at the beginning of 2008.", "As the largest U.S. brand, Taco Bell has been the catalyst of our 2012 U.S. performance. The brand has made great strides with key price introductions at the Doritos and Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell. The good news is that these initiatives not only delivered strong sales this year, but should drive sales in 2013 with new flavor varieties of line extensions to complement our current menu.", "Our biggest global initiative is driving well class operations and I am pleased that Taco Bell continues to make progress in this arena year-after-year. Taco Bell was just recognized for being in the top two in both drive through speed and accuracy by QSR magazine, a goal that they have been aspiring to achieve for several years.", "Pizza Hut and KFC have also contributed significantly to our U.S. performance this year. Pizza Hut has been able to stay relative to consumers by combining strong value with its $10 any pizza and salad innovation. This system has also successfully reversed its trend of declining units by introducing a smaller, less expensive delivery concept we call Delco Lite. After 10 years of unit declines, Pizza Hut added 53 net units in 2011 and expects to add over 130 net new units this year. Our franchisees are very excited about these initiatives and the returns that are generating.", "At KFC, we know we have some heavy sliding ahead of us, but we are stabilizing the business and working better with our franchisees. Our number one focus is to improve our operations. This system is making investments in technology and equipment that can provide a more consistent customer experience. With the successful introduction of Bites and a larger advertising presence, it\u2019s good to see improvement in 2012 in same-store sales and brand profitability.", "We have initiated supply chain initiatives across our U.S. brands. Thanks to partnering with our purchasing coop and our franchisees commodity costs in the US this year are essentially flat which we believe is below the industry rate of inflation. So when we look across our U.S. business, we are proud of what we are accomplishing this year and we also believe that we are improving our business model. We are building a foundation to deliver growth in 2013 and more consistent results going forward.", "Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you, Rick. To start, I would like to thank our operating divisions for their outstanding third quarter performance as 19% EPS growth excluding special items was led by an impressive 18% growth in operating profit prior to foreign currency translation. It\u2019s great to see each of our businesses deliver such strong results reflecting the resilience of our global brands and business models in uncertain times.", "As David and Rick have already summarized third quarter results for each of our divisions, I will limit my Q3 remarks to three key items of interest. China restaurants margin, China new unit development and Yum! shareholder cash payouts; I\u2019ll then lay out our expectations for the fourth quarter and share some initial thoughts on 2013.", "First China restaurant margin; you\u2019ll recall that China margin was down 4 percentage points in the second quarter compared to prior year. As we expected, this trend reversed in the third quarter with margin improving modestly over prior year due to based pricing actions and lower inflation. For the third consecutive quarter, inflation rates fell for both labor and commodities in Q3 coming in at 8% and 2% respectively. This result reinforces our belief that China can sustain a restaurant margin of 20% over the long run.", "Second, China new unit development; as David mentioned, our China division now expects to open over 750 new units this year. To put this into perspective, I would like to point out that a couple of years ago in 2010; China\u2019s new unit growth rate was 13%. This year, it is 18% on a much larger store base. This is a clear breakthrough in development performance and a testament to the size and scale of our China development team.", "Of course, in light of these development results, we're sometimes asked whether we are growing too fast in China. The simple answer is that we approach China development extreme rigor, taking care not too let our cash get out in front of our people capability. This development discipline has four key pillars. ", "Number one, we allocate significant resources to China development with a world-class team that is 1,000 team member strong on the ground, finding, evaluating and securing sights. Capability, that is unmatched in China today. ", "Number two, we select sites based on an intermittent understanding of retail development in China, fully informed by our experience with 5,000 restaurants today, a proprietary database that grows in size and sophistication with each passing year.", "Number three; we evolve our new store portfolio to optimize our returns. For example, shifting development from Tier one cities where store margins are under some pressure to lower tier cities where returns are higher. ", "And number four, as David mentioned, we build a large pipeline of fully qualified restaurant general managers to ensure we open new stores with excellence delivering on our brand promise.", "This is why we are comfortable with our rate of expansion in China and confident in our ability to sustain high returns and generate significant operating cash from this business which brings me to my third Q3 topic Yum! shareholder cash payouts.", "We recently increased our dividend by 18% marking our eighth consecutive annual double-digit percentage increase one of only 12 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. With this rate of growth, we\u2019ve doubled our dividend in less than five years while also returning significant cash through share repurchases.", "This year through Q3, we repurchased shares totaling just over $700 million and we continue to expect at least $800 million in repurchases for the full year. Adding it up, we will return over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases this year all while continuing to invest behind new store development and other growth engines.", "Now I\u2019m going to talk about our expectations for the fourth quarter. In China, we anticipate modest year-over-year margin improvement in Q4 similar to what we saw in the third quarter. This margin improvement and continued strength in new unit development should deliver solid double-digit profit growth for China in the fourth quarter.", "I\u2019m sure many of you are interested to know how same-store sales are currently trending in China, remember our overlap is two points higher as we move into fourth quarter with same-store sales growth of 21% last year. ", "So we do expect comps to moderate further. Additionally, Q4 is our longest fiscal quarter and with three months remaining in a volatile and slowing economy, sales are tough to predict. At this point, our best estimate is that China same-store sales will be low-single digits to flat in Q4.", "Now before I talk about YRI and the US, I\u2019d first like to remind everyone that we have an overlapped headwind due to an additional week in our 2011 fiscal year. This additional week produced a $26 million operating profit benefit to YRI and the US combined or over 4 percentage points of EPS growth. This will obviously have a negative impact on this year\u2019s fourth quarter growth.", "At YRI, we expect fourth quarter same-store sales growth to benefit from the timing of Ramadan reversing the impact seen in Q3. This will contribute to solid profit growth for YRI in Q4 which will be partially offset by the 53rd week overlap that provided an $8 million compared to operating profit last year.", "In the United States we will see substantially weaker performance in the fourth quarter than we have seen so far this year. There are three key reasons why. First, we will have a headwind that went up $18 million as we overlap last year\u2019s 53rd week benefit. This alone equates to 10 points of profit growth on the quarter.", "Second, we expect more moderate same-store sales growth than we have seen so far this year in part because we will be lapping our toughest comps from last year. And finally, our year-to-date refranchising of 340 US restaurants will be profit diluted in the fourth quarter albeit shareholder value positive in the long run.", "In summary for the full year, we are expecting significant profit growth from each of our divisions led by strong sales performance across of our entire business. Therefore, we are raising our full year EPS growth forecast to at least 13% excluding special items marking the 11th consecutive years we are expecting to deliver at least 13% EPS growth.", "Considering the challenging global economy, I am very pleased with our performance and the overall quality of our earnings growth in 2012. I am also confident that our work this year is setting us up nicely for a solid 2013. ", "We are still in the process of developing detailed plans for our businesses next year and as usual we will provide additional perspective at our December meeting in New York. However, I do want to share some initial thoughts for 2013. First, we are fortunate that our new unit development provides us with head start on building next year\u2019s profit plan and this year\u2019s record level pace of 1,750 new units outside the US provides us with the best development driven tail win we ever had. ", "In China specifically, our current development rate is 18% which is well above the low double digit percentage unit increase our ongoing growth model requires. As system sales growth is driven by both new unit development and same-store sales growth, this year\u2019s accelerated pace of development reduces our dependence on same-stores sales growth in 2013 to achieve China\u2019s targeted profit growth of 15%. ", "Nevertheless, we do expect same-stores sales growth in China next year with our new product pipeline as strong as ever and at about 4 points of pricing as we enter the year. At Yum! Restaurant International, our ongoing growth model cost for net unit growth of 3% to 4%. This year, we will build 900 new units driving net unit growth of 4%. When you consider that India is no longer contributing to YRI\u2019s new units, this effectively amounts to an increase in YRI\u2019s development pace. ", "Our growth model calls for same-store sales growth of at least 2% to 3% of YRI and we look to be on track to deliver this. Additionally, over 45% of YRI\u2019s units are in emerging markets where economic growth is higher than the rest of the world further bolstering YRI same-store sales growth expectations for 2013.", "In the US our ongoing growth model calls for same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%. As you know, the US had an outstanding year this year and Taco bell is now building up two great new platforms, Doritos Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell. These platforms will be the catalyst for innovation in 2013, driving same-store sales to expected levels.", "In 2012, we also had net unit growth at both Taco Bell and Pizza Hut and expect this to continue next year as well. And finally, we\u2019ll continue to benefit from our restaurant productivity initiatives, which have delivered significant benefits to our U.S. businesses this year.", "In conclusion, we have a lot of confidence in our business model and the consistency that Yum! provides to the power of our global portfolio. At the end of 2012, this portfolio will have delivered annual double-digit EPS growth over the past 11 years, even in challenging macroeconomic circumstances and our global brand portfolio has never been stronger as our teams continue to grow and invest in emerging markets and manage cost efficiently. For these reasons, I strongly believe that 2013 will be another year where Yum! will deliver double-digit EPS growth for our shareholders.", "And with that, we\u2019re happy to take questions Ashley.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Palmer with UBS.", "David Palmer - UBS", "Good morning and congrats on the quarter and also thanks for the details on this call. You mentioned the China economy is slowing and the fourth quarter same-store sales were at less pricing and that leads you to the low single digit to flat guidance there. Is there anything beyond, in the details of your business and the trends that you are seeing that gives you visibility in terms of where things may bottom in terms of same-store sales and I mentioned that just naturally investors are going to be off balance until they figure our where the bottom in your at least the same-store sales are going to be, is there any sense of that for you in your China business? Thanks.", "David Novak", "", "David I don\u2019t know I\u2019ll drill the answer to that. First of all, we\u2019re not economist or we\u2019re not, we can\u2019t we have not really seen or read any news or have any real news that you really don\u2019t have or you can\u2019t read about already and what we do see is clearly that there is an economic slowdown in China which again is not any news than we talked about this the last time.", "I think the biggest thing that I would want to just point is we\u2019ve been able to deliver consistent results and we\u2019ve been able to do that year-after-year. And I think it\u2019s because our business model is really strong and obviously China even with its challenges is still growing at a reasonable pace. It\u2019s up, GDP was up 7% in the second quarter; it\u2019s expected to be up 8% in 2013 according to the Financial Times and retail growth is supposed to be double the GDP.", "I think for us, the biggest tailwind we have is just the consuming class continues to grow expected to double in the next 10 years. And you guys read the same stuff we read and look same facts are reported. Personal incomes, the middle class incomes are rising, which is also a big plus. And as you saw, our infrastructure, the infrastructure growth is really continuing to grow at a higher rate. So we\u2019ve got all these new cities and clusters and trade zones coming into play that we\u2019re able to now penetrate.", "And so I think the big news for us is old news frankly is that we\u2019re really in position to capitalize on what\u2019s going on in China more which is still the fastest growing economy more than any other retail in the world, we have got leading brands, a business model with three year cash-on-cash, the returns, competitive brand positions that are better than they have ever been. We have got unmatched development capability, you have seen our management team in action; they have been together for a long time, gets better and better, and a lot of young talent coming in. We own our supply chain and we are just attracting top talent, I mean the fact that I pointed out in my remarks, we have 10,000 management trainees this year and 2,000 ready to go assistant managers.", "So, I think, I look at this business long-term, I have to say you know we\u2019re going to have our ups and downs right now, we\u2019re kind of based in a slower economy, but I am always going to be glad, I wake everyday and know that we have a position we have in China and I think as we look to the long terms, we are very confident in what we have ahead of us.", "Rick Carucci", "And David, what I would add to that is that we\u2019ve clearly acknowledged the same-store sales have slowed down in part because we are lapping extraordinary performance from last year, but also because the economy is swelling. But I also pointed out that given the accelerated pace of new unit development this year, tracking at 18% as we enter next year we are going to be less reliant on same-store sales growth to achieve our 15% profit growth for the China division.", "So when you add that all up, when you consider the pace of development, when you consider the pricing that we have rolling into next year and the ongoing strength of our new product pipeline, not to mention, the strong people capability as David mentioned, we continue to be very optimistic that we will achieve that 15% profit growth for China next year.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks. Next questions please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs", "Hi guys, I have I guess two questions. The first one is, how can we be confident in positive China same-store sales in \u201913 and as per your guidance when traffic is running negative right now, the economy is still decelerating and you\u2019ll have less pricing rolling through the P&L next year. So essentially what I am asking is what are you seeing that makes you, that makes positive your base case?", "And then secondly, the accelerated new unit development in China; you talked about why you are comfortable with the pace of opening in the prepared remarks and it all makes total sense. But I just wanted to ask, if you were in fact growing too fast and may be making some mistakes that were being obscured by the near term growth that it provides, how would you know it before it was too late; what are you looking at?", "David Novak", "I am happy to respond to that Michael and I\u2019ll start with the second piece on development. As I mentioned, we have extraordinary development capability in China. We review the performance of our new units routinely paying attention to every possible operating metric you can imagine and there is extreme diligence around how we manage our new restaurant portfolio including shifting as I mentioned development from the Tier 1 cities of where returns have softened into the lower Tier cities where we have higher margins and our returns are outstanding.", "So we do capitalize on what we learned from recent new store openings to inform how we manage our pipeline going forward. So there is extreme diligence and vigor around that entire process; regular review by again a team that is very, very experienced and unmatched in capability in China.", "As for the second question on positive same-stores sales for next year, we do have four points of pricing as we enter next year and depending on how we construct our plan for next year, we may find opportunity to take additional pricing. But at the same time, we are confident in our track record of new product innovation and how we have been able to grow our business overtime we have added sales layers to our business. We're not fully penetrated in all of those sales layers.", "So as we move those two, 100% penetration and we continue to introduce new product innovation. We're confident that we'll be able to generate eventually the same-store transaction growth along with the check growth that comes from pricing to achieve the same-store sales growth on New Year. Now as we said before, there can be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. So I am talking about a full-year basis when I say that we're optimistic that we will deliver the same-store sales growth in 2013. ", "Rick Carucci", "I think one other really good example on just how we approach development, a couple of years ago, Pizza Casual Dining, our unit economics had slowed down and so we did not expand further. We didn\u2019t move into Tier III, Tier IV, Tier V cities at all. What we did as we went back and the team revamped our business so that we added much more menu variety and we also took our value equation where we went with a eat like a rich man, eat like a poor man approach where we had a great every day value entry pricing, half priced menu, entrees on a daily basis and the transactions and profits just went through the roof. ", "And then we started expanding into three, four and five cities. So, I think that\u2019s a great example that where we really follow our mantra which is don\u2019t get you cash out in front of your people capability and or your business model and we constantly are tracking our performance quarterly with what we call our new unit tracking system as Pat talked about, but that\u2019s a great example of how we look at things. I tell the guys all the time and I\u2019ve said this before, we got a great diamonds, great brands, keep caution don\u2019t grow any faster than we grow. ", "And what\u2019s happening though is that we\u2019re able to grow fast because the opportunities are out there and increasing and we\u2019re able to deal with great returns for our shareholders. So we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re growing the business the right way and I can assure you that the team has been told and from day one we\u2019ve never been chasing a number. The number just keeps getting bigger and bigger than what any of us ever expected.", "We went into this year with a projection of 600, okay, this was after we did 650 last year. Why was it 600? Don\u2019t grow faster than what we need to, we don\u2019t give, we\u2019re not trying to be heroes, we\u2019re trying to build a heroic business.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jonathan (inaudible) with Robert W. Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Pat just a follow-up question on the restaurant margin outlook for China for Q4. And I\u2019m wondering specifically what your current expectation is in terms of commodity and wage rate inflation?", "Pat Grismer", "Absolutely, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are expecting modest year-over-year improvement in China margins in the fourth quarter comparable to what we saw in the third quarter but how we will get there will be a bit different. We\u2019re expecting for example, a positive impact from inflation because we expect there will be in fact deflation on our commodities in China in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re expecting a lower a benefit from pricing as we rollover some pricing actions we took last year.", "We\u2019re expecting the impact from new store development to be about the same. So when you add all of those factors together, we\u2019re looking at that point of improvement on margins year-over-year excluding the impact of Little Sheep.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And I guess one more clarification question just on the expectation for slower China comps in Q4. You mentioned that you\u2019re cycling price and you already recycled some again in November. So I just want to ask and I am wondering specifically on the traffic component for China, how much slow in you expect for that factor in Q4 and then whether or not you have actually seen that materialize yet quarter-to-date?", "Pat Grismer", "Well, just to recap a little bit. In Q3, what we have with 6% same-store sales growth, we had about a 7% pricing advantage. So as David mentioned, transactions were down about a point. And what we are expecting for Q4 as same-store sales growth of low-single digits to flat and we have about five points of pricing benefits, so that would give you low-single digit same-store transaction declined in the fourth quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, got it and which you read the pricing as a proxy for overall check growth?", "Pat Grismer", "Yeah.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Jon. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason West for Deutsche Bank.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Just one thing on the modeling or as two things on the China revenue side that did come in a little bit below our total revenue for that segment even tough the comps were better than we expected. So it looks like the new store productivity had slipped a little bit. I don\u2019t know if you can talk about that, what maybe the drivers of that and then just secondly, should we remodeling unit growth in China next year similar to what you are doing this year because I think historically once you step it up, you have kept it at the higher rate, thanks?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Hey John, this is Tim Jerzyk. It\u2019s hard for us to understand exactly what you were expecting; we kind of give you our best thoughts on that even on the last call. I am not sure what you are expecting for Little Sheep. I know there were some discussions we have had with other analysts about the expectations from royalties from Little Sheep and it was a shorter than what had people expected. So that might be or where we were below what you expected. Our new store productivity has consistently been very much stable over the last five years, six years; it\u2019s about 30% less than our average unit volumes of our business net holding steady for both Pizza Hut and KFC. ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Okay then on the development side?", "David Novak", "Okay, in terms of development outlook for next year? ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Right, so we would be modeling similar unit openings in China for next year that you did this year?", "David Novak", "Well Jason, we will be providing that guidance at our December Analyst Conference as we had in years past.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Jason. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer", "Two questions on the US business. Number one, as this big (inaudible) from the Doritos, Locos Tacos somewhat fades a bit at Taco Bell when can we expect you to come out with some more SKU\u2019s to sustain the momentum particularly the cool ranch which is something I am just really excited for and waiting for and then also just a very strong comps at Pizza Hut, if you can just talk about that do you think it is a result of a strong category in the quarter or there are something different you were doing in 3Q to take some significant market share?", "David Novak", "Well Brian, on the first piece, we are not going to give out the exact date, but we expect to have extensions of Doritos, Locos Tacos in next year and part of the reason we pushed that into 2013 was because we were so successful, it basically used all of our available supply of Taco shelves, but maybe you said coupon right before the positive come out since you are big fan of the product volume as well. Regarding Pizza Hut, we\u2019ve had pretty good success through the course of the last year on the boxes, so our box promotions have been very successful and we use those heavily in Q3 and we will probably continue to go on those going forward.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer", "But do you think that the category was strong in the third quarter or I mean do you think a large part of kind of the upside in the comp was market share gains because of the box?", "David Novak", "Yeah, we haven't gone into some of the detailed pieces; I would say we didn\u2019t see a huge - the stuff I have seen, I haven't seen huge changes in overall category in the quarter.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Brian. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.", "Andy Barish - Jefferies", "Hey guys, can you talk about the inflation, particularly the food cost commodity side of things. It seems as if there is something more than just the raw material input cost using up a little bit. I wasn\u2019t aware of some of the changes in the U.S. distribution side of things or maybe it's more full priced product being sold, you know, DLT at $1.29 instead of a regular Taco. Can you give us a little bit more flavor or color on sort of that benefit for commodities and maybe an initial look at 2013?", "Pat Grismer", "Well, I\u2019ll certainly comment on 2012 again any guidance on 2013 will defer to our December Analyst Conference. As far as 2012 is concerned, we have seen significant benefit from what we call our restaurant margin initiatives focused on supply chain efficiencies. And you see that rolling through the U.S., so to recap what our quarterly commodity inflation trend has been in the U.S. Q1 at 4%, Q2 at 1% deflation, Q3 2% deflation, we\u2019re expecting for Q4, 1% deflation so you can see a nice trend there which to your point reflects not only what we\u2019re seeing is a general softening and commodities prices, but the added benefit of the supply chain efficiencies we\u2019re gaining through these initiatives. And that just takes us to flat on commodity inflation for the year, so its market price movement along with advantage we\u2019re gaining through our supply chain initiatives.", "Rick Carucci", "The supply chain initiative is a good example, but David has talked about quite a bit on some of the previous calls. We\u2019re doing a much better job of sharing, learning between divisions either between the U.S. and international or even within U.S. division. So this is actually initiative that was spearheaded by Pizza Hut that we\u2019ve now taken to the other U.S. businesses and now to other markets around the world. So we have a bottleneck consultant and just looked at how we could be more efficient in some of the supply chain opportunities that we had. And we\u2019re seeing some benefits of that this year and I expect to see some benefits for that next year as well.", "Andy Barish - Jefferies", "And any guess at selling more full priced product whether it\u2019s Taco Bell or China now kind of lapping the big value platforms that you put in place in 2011 in terms of the benefit of higher gross margins?", "Rick Carucci", "", "Yeah, well obviously as you look at what we want to do in all of our brands in the U.S. and around the world, we\u2019re always looking at but what we call menu mix management and you know what you would take for pricing and how do you offer value to the consumers and what prices are your new initiatives. And we have benefited this year to the point that you are making as with Doritos Locos Tacos we think in some cases people are probably trading out of regular Tacos for those and those are priced at a higher level. And as we look at 2013, at least in one of our divisions that I have seen some detail, we probably will have more of our initiatives to say the higher priced items which should help us on menu mix. So we why make sure we could stay focused on core value in some of that main parts of our menu.", "David Novak", "I think one of the things that we are very pleased about in terms of our competitive positions with KFC, with Taco Bell and Pizza Hut in U.S. is that we are very competitive on everyday pricing basis. Taco Bell is renowned industry leader for price value and Pizza Hut with its $10 large pizza pricing structure that we continually reinforce is competitive on an everyday basis. So when you have that everyday pricing in place, when you come in on top of that with the innovation, you are able to do the menu management that Rick is really talking about. And that's a formula that we are going for all around the world, I mean it\u2019s we believe that low everyday pricing, entry pricing and then you innovate the heck out of the business and I think we do a pretty good job of that.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Andy. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Citigroup.", "Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup", "Great, thanks. Hey, just two quick ones. First is, how much of the China slowdown besides though I say the 200 basis point tougher compare is due more to the economy versus pricing; I mean what do you see as kind of the biggest factor there? And then just on the U.S. side, the Cantina product, it sounds like it\u2019s having some good momentum, is that due to more trading up or you are getting more new customers from that product?", "Pat Grismer", "On the China comps Greg, it\u2019s really difficult to segment the change quarter-over-quarter into how much is driven by the economy versus the comps and the comp is pretty clear. But we have acknowledged that there has been a slowing trend in the China economy and that\u2019s impacting the retail space broadly and we are feeling some effect of that.", "David Novak", "Regarding the Cantina Bell products, we don\u2019t have a lot of breakdown mathematically on new customer\u2019s etcetera; it\u2019s difficult to get QSR space. We do have anecdotally as a few things, first of all we are seeing more people at lunch time and that the people who buy Cantina products have higher ticket, which is obviously expected given the price point of the product. So we are seeing sort of that benefits on that products and you know we think that if that\u2019s casual guys, so it taught us a lesson which is that people want in a very high quality even food that are going spend more money if they get speed and convenience and obviously with the distribution that we have in restaurants around the country we are able to do that.", "And one of the other things that\u2019s great about that product is that our team loves it. First of all, Lorena Garcia the chef who created a very, a professional personality and she has been very visible to the product launches to our chains through videos and personal appearances and the teams just loves serving the product and getting new customers. And the other anecdotal thing I would say is that our products are skewed a little bit more towards lunch and female customers; again that\u2019s anecdotal math behind that, but that\u2019s what we are hearing from our folks.", "Rick Carucci", "Just a little bit more perspective on China. I think when you think about the economic slowdown in China, think about our business in the context of that because keep in mind; we're overlapping 19% same-store sales growth with transaction growth of 27% during the third quarter of last year. So that\u2019s two years same-store sales growth of 26% and two years transaction growth of 26%. That\u2019s pretty amazing and then think about we\u2019ve added over 750 restaurants. So, I think immediately the economy is slowing down but when you look at our business performance in this environment, I think you would have to say it's the transient in any kind of economic headwind or whatever (inaudible) you would like to use.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Great. Next question please Ashley.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays", "Just two follow-up questions. One, I know in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit Pat about the return of cash to shareholders, the balance between I guess repo and dividend. Just wondering one whether you would consider shifting that balance more from share purchase to perhaps pushing the dividend. I know it's currently just South of the 2% yield level and whether or not you would separately consider increasing leverage, obviously with rates where they are today and then just as a follow-up on the US talk about side of things. Just wondering whether you can give any kind of color in terms of the whether be the mix in terms of what you are selling or whether you think early read on (inaudible) in terms of mix or any kind of data points you can provide there. I know everyone focusing on Doritos and (inaudible) but perhaps if you are seeing broader strength that you think would be sustainable beyond those two products, any color would be great?", "Pat Grismer", "All right. Jeff I\u2019ll address the question on cash payouts. We\u2019re very happy with the mix of cash return that we\u2019re providing our shareholders today. We\u2019re delighted to taken up our dividend by 18% and to be on track to complete another year of significant share repurchases. In our view, this is a good mix. We do look on at our capital structure and determine whether or not a different approach is going to be better for shareholders. At this stage even given low borrowing rates, we don\u2019t think that it makes sense to lever up, to position ourselves to pay either higher dividend or to repurchase more shares. We believe that the strength of our operating cash and the growth in our cash flow year-over-year positions us well to continue to grow our dividend and to continue to accomplish significant with the share repurchases and there are no plans today to shift that strategy. But it is something that we do look at from time-to-time. ", "David Novak", "Regarding your question on mix at Taco Bell traditionally a lot of our product at a particular point time does come from new products that we introduced. The overall Taco mix has gone up considerably so we know that Doritos Locos Tacos piece has been was largely incremental when we launched it. And that\u2019s our total Taco mix is in the mid-teens to low 20s. So we took that up with the launch of the Doritos Locos Tacos. And that part is right now is having about a 7% mix or so. Cantina Bell is about a little under 5% mix right now. And obviously we want to grow that overtime.", "Rick Carucci", "Those are very high mixes for Taco Bell.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays", "Okay. ", "David Novak", "The thing that we just came back from the franchise convention in Colorado, where we were celebrating the [58th] anniversary. I think the people are very excited, the franchises are excited about just the quality, ingredient to upgrade and the fact that we are seeing more up scale consumers and we are seeing more females as Rick pointed out. So this is something I think will build over time. I think one fact what is over 200 million Doritos Locos Tacos have been sold. So this is like, this is prior the most talked about product in our industry right now. I mean and people can't wait for the Doritos. And we really feel like Cantina Bell is just puts us into a whole rein of target and relevant and price value. I mean this product is third of the price for what you get at some of these places. Its two-thirds of the price and consumers recognize us. So we think that overtime.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Jeff. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Elliott with Raymond James.", "Bryan Elliott - Raymond James", "I guess, I just like to get your thoughts on the sort of reality of $7 to $8 corn for globally for 2013 and what you are thinking about that might mean both for purchasing power of your emerging consumers as well as obviously the cost of goods, so I just, I know you don't want to but make any specific comments about \u201813 but just few general thoughts on that significant issue?", "David Novak", "Well as you say Brian, it is a significant issue. It is relevant to our business. We will provide guidance at the December Investor Conference but just to provide a little bit of perspective over the years we have seen commodity peaks like this and we have dealt with them. We dealt with them through a combination of pricing and productivity measures and we don\u2019t expect that 2013 is going to be any different in that regard.", "Bryan Elliott - Raymond James", "Do you see a risk to purchasing power given the percentage of sort of an emerging markets or percentage of income of those new middle class consumers that still goes to food overall potentially being a purchasing power decrease?", "Rick Carucci", "Nothing material but as you have heard say before in these emerging markets we are continuing to see expansion of the consuming class overall that will more than make up for any impact that might be for the purchasing power as the consequence of the shifting commodity prices. ", "Bryan Elliott - Raymond James", "If I can sneak one more in and the YRI slow down was pretty meaningful from first half to third quarter across broad range of geographies, could you feel that back a little bit and is that average ticket, is it traffic, is it competition reducing increasing the amount of sales may be at about lower ticket or promoted items, just give us a sense of what the competitive landscape is there, how much of it may be competition versus consumer behavior change?", "", "Rick Carucci", "I don\u2019t think competition has changed much. So I don\u2019t see that any of the changes is really due to that when you are looking on a total YRI basis, just do want to remind a couple of things that we did talk about is that Ramadan had about 1 point swing for the overall business. So on the emerging market business we said was plus 5% for the quarter, we think it had a 2 point impact; it wasn\u2019t clear from my comments with Ramadan moved forward in 2012, so we expect the bounce back in those markets in the fourth quarter and so far we\u2019ve actually seen that so and we gave Middle East as an example where we had big impact negatively in the third quarter. That will have an impact positively in the fourth quarter.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks Brian. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. I wanted to revisit the China unit opening schedule question again. Two parts to it, one is, I understand you want to be cautious in terms of not out running your resources, but it looks like your history in China there has only been one year in last decade where you\u2019ve opened fewer units in a subsequent year versus a prior year that was a six. So why wouldn\u2019t so another 50 be the new run rate just based on that history and based on your willingness or desire to manage your business in a fairly constant level, but that\u2019s question number one?", "And number two, and during these periods of rapid expansion or acceleration of unit growth, the question often comes up about new store productivity and the easiest way for us to measure that is just store volumes, not returns because we can\u2019t look at the cost as easily as you can, but just the store volumes. What factors are going to drive and move around the store volumes as we calculate them; in other words, are there in your six tier markets lower volumes, it doesn\u2019t look like from most recent materials, but if they are and then also, would there be brand make shift for example as Pizza Hut home delivery going to be a bigger piece of your unit openings next year and will that change volumes materially for the overall blended. If you can comment on those two, I appreciate it.", "David Novak", "Yeah John, I\u2019ll respond to the first piece with respect to new store volumes, to your very point, you know, we\u2019ve seen very high volumes in the lower tier cities. So any shift in the mix of development across the tiers is not going to have an impact to new store productivity. And the same would hold for brand mix shift; well, yes, we will be picking up the pace of pizza delivery or pizza home service development overtime; it\u2019s not going to be to an extent, but it\u2019s going to have a material impact to new store productivity.", "And then as it relates to new unit openings, again, we\u2019ll provide guidance on next year at our December Analyst Conference. Certainly, given the pace of development this year and how we have grown our capability in China to support a new store program of this magnitude, it gives a lot of confidence that we have reached a new level, but we\u2019re not providing guidance on next year\u2019s development at this stage.", "Rick Carucci", "", "John, we have our annual operating plan for China in the next couple of weeks and we\u2019ll go into more detail on this. But the message the team is going to be that and just keep building a quality business and the number will be what it is. But obviously, look we\u2019re not building this business to open up 750 restaurants a year. We want to get to over a 1,000 capability. So that\u2019s our \u2013 and we want to just keep getting bigger and bigger and better and better, but doing it the right way. So we\u2019ll give you more color at the upcoming meeting.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "And just you mentioned 1,000 units; over what timeframe do you think you require to get to 1,000 units a year?", "David Novak", "I don\u2019t know; sometime in my lifetime you know.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Rick Carucci", "I\u2019ll have an answer to that; you know if you\u2019ve followed our company since the very beginning, we\u2019ve never really given a number and never really told people that we\u2019re going to try to get to that. But the whole thing has been build people capability so that we can grow, build the brands. Our brands, what gives you the ability to grow fast is when you\u2019ve got great brands with a great economic model which we do and I think the good news for us is that we still have less than three year cash on cash, cash payback. So we got a great, great business model.", "And I think that the thing that gives us a lot of confidence is when you can match that business model with the people capability, you can do very amazing things like the team has done this year and I think that, we went into this year with a target I think of 600 and in the previous year, we had opened 656 okay and the number is going to be over 750. I kind of liked that approach to business; I would rather have a number that\u2019s going to force us to go through all the disciplines to make sure that we are doing the right things and then I would like to surprise you, okay, with performance that's the right kind of performance and that's kind of our approach.", "So everybody has their own models and everybody builds their own kind of forecast and this stuff and we kind of layout what we layout, and you guys can do your own math, but we are trying to run the business on the basis of given our shareholders great returns and at the same time making sure we\u2019re building our brands the right way.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks John. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research", "Great, thanks very much and yes, I do have another question on China. I guess maybe, a lot of the questions are alluding to and I\u2019ll ask you in a separate way, is that with unit growth accelerating can maybe give us a sense of what the cannibalization factor may be has been in year\u2019s past and do you expect that cannibalization factor to increase or remain steady or perhaps even decrease just say over the next few quarters?", "And then separately, just on KFC versus Pizza Hut, if you can give us what the comps were for each concept in the third quarter and it looks like maybe, is Pizza Hut maybe suffering more of a -- or having more of a slowdown than KFC and maybe how we should look at the outlook just given that Pizza Hut as a higher price point if perhaps KFC might potentially comp better than Pizza Hut has been comping a lot better than KFC over the past several quarters? Thank you.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Yeah Mitch this is Tim. Yeah, by brand it was six for KFC and eight for Pizza Hut in Q3, sorry we didn\u2019t put that in there; that was my call, because it was virtually identical I figured out it wasn\u2019t necessary, but clearly it is, so I\u2019ll be sure to put that in there from now on.", "Cannibalization, a year in China for the investor conference, I think you\u2019ve got a sense for what we are doing and it think that they basically reiterated what so, where are we getting these additional new units that David was talking about with the 750 versus 600 target coming and 656 last year. It\u2019s really a lot of what [Lily Shay] our former CFO said last December and it was that government is building on infrastructure and they are building out this mega city clusters and we are getting more locations in the lower tier cities; there is more transport hubs which they identified had, identified in the presentation and then also Pizza Hut Casual Dining as we have been saying that\u2019s a new opportunity for us in going beyond Tier I and Tier II and which is what it had been pretty much up until like 18 months ago. ", "We have actually opened up a 170, over 170 over the last four quarters of the Pizza Hut Casual Dining compared to 115 last year and by opening Tier III, IV and V to Pizza Hut Casual Dining that\u2019s basically almost a billion people that now we can add distribution to for that brand versus where it wasn\u2019t before.", "In terms of the cannibalization, what we had said before was about one and five new stores of KFC had cannibalized in the past up to may be as much as 20% but I haven\u2019t seen anything lately on that, Mitch. I believe that my guess would be the numbers are a lot, is lower. Just because we're building so many more in new cities and we're building so many more Pizza Huts where the cannibalization factor is probably a lot less. So it was a factor maybe, three, four, five years ago but it's not really that much of a factor today and what it looks like.", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research", "I am sorry if you could just maybe just comment on the Pizza Hut comp versus KFC in terms of, it looks like Pizza Hut might be slowing on a year-over-year basis and maybe a faster pace than KFC, is that something that do you think we should expect given that the ticket is higher or is the fact that there is less competition for Pizza Hut that the out performance of Pizza Hut can continue or you think it can continue when you look at the outlook?", "Tim Jerzyk", "You know, I think for one thing, we can give more color but just to give you a little bit of a background on that, I think Pizza Hut had 11 straight quarters of double-digit same-store sales growth coming into this quarter and it's lap was even more significant than KFC in Q3, it was lapping like 30% growth over the past three years. So, yeah it just slowed down, but I mean those are still big numbers and I think importantly for us, which is what we\u2019ve been saying, it moves that brand into a very growth oriented position or now we can really grow this with great economics at least equal to KFC and the average unit volumes are comparable to KFC. So it's plus eight but it's lapping some big, big numbers over the last three years.", "Thanks Mitch. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joe Buckley - Bank of America", "Thank you for bearing with us. A couple of questions on China and then one on food cost. So in China did the timing of the openings very much this quarter with a very backend loaded that would be my first question. And then secondly, the transaction count decline presumably it includes the benefits of breakfast and delivery in 24 hours. So when the core dayparts how significant with the transaction count decline. And then just a last one you talked about 4% pricing in China going into 2013, if food costs are moderating and if you\u2019re expecting to continue to moderate at least in the early part of next year, what sort of the rationale behind the pricing even so after transaction counts?", "Tim Jerzyk", "Joe, I\u2019m happy to respond here. In order starting with in the timing of openings, I don\u2019t know that the distribution of our new store openings this year is any different or materially different from last year. But with respect to the transaction decline I don\u2019t know what it is for core dayparts when you strip out the new sales layers. I really can\u2019t respond to that question.", "And then finally with respect to next year\u2019s pricing versus inflation, as I said in my remarks or in a response to another question that we could take pricing next year there are no, there are no definite plans at this stage to do that. You are right that given what we\u2019re seeing by way of commodity deflation in China in the fourth quarter those trends will likely persist into at least the first half of next year.", "So we\u2019ll provide more context to you at the December conference in terms of our views on same-store sales and how much pricing and when we might take it. But the fact is that the new pricing strategy that we implemented over the course of Q2 and into Q3 is one the China team is very happy with that increase the level of sophistication and we are able to go and segment their market and determine variable pricing and that will likely continue into next year.", "Pat Grismer", "Joe, on the transaction piece, just one point on that when I looked at the daypart mixes they didn't change. So while we don't have what the core was, it doesn't look like it was something in particular related to any particular daypart or core, that\u2019s the best I can tell from what I have seen.", "", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, Joe. Next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from R. J. Hottovy with Morningstar.", "R. J. Hottovy - Morningstar", "I just had one quick question and its kind of an ancillary question to the unit development growth that you are planning for the next couple years. How comfortable are you in terms of the unit growth with what we have seen in terms of bank and potential constraints for franchise financing right now. Just I wanted you to take on kind of the overall data on financing the franchisees at this point across YRI and potentially China as well? Thanks.", "David Novak", "Yeah. And we haven't seen any issues of getting access to credit for our international business, a lot of our international franchisees are pretty big players and they have been in the business for a while. So a lot of their growth they are able to fund through existing cash flows as well, so we don't see that as (inaudible) in anyway to our growth going forward.", "Tim Jerzyk", "Thanks, next question please Ashley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Obviously, you guys have demonstrated I mean so much success in emerging markets and more examples necessary you mentioned China being the highlight. But then we look at developed markets, and so I wanted to really relate these two points as last year we talked about may be talking talk about refranchising being more down than what it had been in previous years, we are obviously success with the brand this year and it looks like talk about refranchising is all but about the stock. ", "So of course the question in the US is one I put Taco Bell in the hands of franchisees when the economics are so strong and allow them to grow and develop the brand as really as franchisees can and then secondly, having been with McDonalds recently in Europe and studying their markets every year, the demographics in the competitive markets of France and especially Germany will repeat this being very good by a lot of people so I mean why not take that risk and put it solely in the hands of franchisees and pursue a rental model with all and in other words why not you pursue development in continental Europe on the peer capital way franchise model versus directly or indirectly investing your own capital?", "David Novak", "Let me then make sure I have the first part of this right and I will clarify my comments on refranchise. In the US we are basically done with our hitting our targets for KFC and Pizza Hut which we say we wanted to get down to about 5% ownership level in both of those brands and we are close to those, we will be close to those numbers actually now. On the Taco Bell side, our goal was to take the Taco Bell ownership level down from sort of the low 20\u2019s to about 60% by the end of next year. We are continuing along that path. So we have been doing modest refranchising for Taco Bell over the last year and a half we will continue that over the next year and half. So that\u2019s what we are doing on the US side.", "Regarding the question on France and why would we pursue the business rental model versus franchising; the first piece of that we really did is that was delayed to get growth. When we were looking at France, the unit, the great news about France is that we have highest average volumes in the world. The bad news about France is its very expensive. So not that many franchisees, who, when you had the brand that was new in the market, you know, had several million dollars that they were able to put down on a new unit and what we found as we started the business rental model is we\u2019ve been very pleased with the quality of the franchisees. It is we maybe didn\u2019t have as best to as much capital what was required there.", "So we found that we were happy with the way the restaurants were being operated. We believe we could have a big business there from an opportunity standpoint that we talked about before and you know we believe that we\u2019re having the right level of case of growth there. So we feel pretty good about how things are developing in France and we do have a few franchisees over there at the beginning and they are doing some growth at new units, but we expect a fair amount of our development to stay in the business rental model.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "And if I can ask Rick, in Germany, which is you perceived is being the more, competitive global QSR market, and might there be a shift you know overtime in both of those markets, to your pure franchise model when the franchisees get established and the economics get to be more proven?", "Rick Carucci", "We\u2019ll always look at what we think the right mix is between company; we will probably have all three there. We have some company ownership; there we have the business rental model and we have straight franchising. We probably continue to have the blend, continue to look at that overtime, but right now we're pretty happy with the current mix that we have.", "David Novak", "And maybe things for us, you know, on this John is how little of a business we have there already; I mean yes, we have now economics that we think are scalable. So I think that what we try to do is we try to learn from each other and we also try to learn from competition. And I think McDonalds has shown us that the business rental models are where you can expand with good returns over the long-term in continental Europe and I think we\u2019ve gone to school on that model and we think it can work for us.", "And the good news for us is that we\u2019re just, we\u2019re really ground floor; we\u2019re ground floor on this. And we have a capital monitoring system that we put into place and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to monitor the unit economics. It\u2019s something says that we shouldn\u2019t be going that way we can always pullback. But right now we\u2019re really talking about our business, it\u2019s pretty insignificant that we think can become very significant and I think that\u2019s the real point for our shareholders.", "I think it\u2019s upon us to really do whatever we can as Rick said to really grow the business and we think that the business rental model unlocks that growth for us and held a lot faster than if we were just working with the pure franchise business. Given where we\u2019re at, at such an embryonic stage and as to your point earlier is that if things change down the road, we can always look at the mix of our ownership. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve done throughout our history and I think pretty well.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "And with respect, there\u2019s an interesting contract is, okay I understand.

Can you please give us an update to the status of the efforts to sell the Pizza Hut UK business, and then just add to the little bit, does your guidance for what company restaurant margins at YRI might look like post site divestitures still remain intact especially given the strong margin performance of YRI this quarter, thanks?", "Pat Grismer", "Yes, we are in very active discussions with a buyer for the business and we remain optimistic that deal will close by the end of the year. And as we said before we expect that will or when we complete that refranchising that YRI will see two points of margin improvement. Now, you know how these deals go and it\u2019s possible that the deal could slip into early part in next year but we are optimistic that we will see close by the end of the year.", "Rick Carucci", "Yeah. As Pat said, we are in active negotiations where we believe it will close this year but we are going to have the right deal. So if slips into next year, we are okay with that too.", "David Novak", "Okay. Thank you all for being on the call. So let me rap up the Yum! Story overall, we are having another solid year and we are raising our full year EPS guidance to at least 13%, 11 straight years of least 13% EPS growth it\u2019s something that we really proud of, with record international unit development, we are confident on our future growth as well. So as we look at 2013 we are confident of our international businesses that are set up for continued growth and our US businesses on more solid putting to drive more consistent results going forward. ", "We have track record to prove how powerful our growth model is, with the expected opening of 1,750 international units this year and our strategies in the based business, we definitely feel we are in good position for next year and expect to continue our track record of double-digit earnings growth in 2013 and beyond.

Following remarks from each, we will take your questions.Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak.David NovakThank you Tim and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. This is clearly an interesting and challenging time for Yum! Brands immediately following another year of at least 13% earnings per share growth, excluding special items during 2012. This markets the 11th consecutive year we exceeded our annual target of at least 10% which puts us in an elite group of high growth companies. Our 2012 highlight was setting a record for international new unit development which will strengthen our foundation for even more long term growth. In fact, we opened nearly 2000 units outside the United States as well as positioning the United States business for more consistent returns. Overall, there is no question in our mind that our organizational capability is stronger than our and our long term growth opportunities have never been better. However, I know for sure, the issue that the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind is what's going on with China and the government\u2019s recent review of China\u2019s poultry supply, and the corresponding sharp sales decline that began in our KFC business during the last two weeks of December.Today, we want to provide some additional color around how it has impacted our business and how we plan to restore confidence with our customers and get them back into our restaurants. But first here is what happened. There was an investigative report broadcast on a program similar to 60 Minutes by Chinese Central Television, CCTV. That\u2019s a Chinese state owned enterprise which aired on December 18, 2012. It was carried throughout China and was clearly linked to the KFC brand. The report showed that a few poultry farmers were ignoring laws and regulations by using excessive levels of antibiotics in chicken. Regrettably, some of this product was purchased by two poultry suppliers of KFC China.The CCTV story led to an investigation by the Shanghai FDA which caused future media attention, intensifying negative, sensationalized social media commentary. These events significantly impacted consumer confidence in KFC. This onslaught of negative media coverage have been longer lasting and more impactful then we ever imagined, lasting over six weeks. The media coverage is beginning to wind down because on January 21 of this year, the Shanghai FDA reported it\u2019s concluding findings of the investigation. The Shanghai FDA identified issues and provided supervisory recommendations to Yum! China to strengthen our poultry supply chain practices including improved voluntary self-testing procedures, improved reporting and communications, and enhanced supplier management.It is important to note that the Shanghai FDA did not bring a case against Yum! China and no fines were assessed. We have whole-heartedly accepted these recommendations and appreciate the thorough review by the Shanghai FDA. Now hindsight is always 20/20 and history is only good for two things. First, to learn from it, and second, to inspire your belief about what can be done in the future. We are applying our learnings and findings from the Shanghai FDA to further strengthen our QA processes. Our customers expect high quality safe food and they feel that we have let them down. To restore consumer confidence in KFC, we will launch an enhanced product quality assurance program along with an aggressive marketing campaign shortly after the Chinese New Year.Now looking back, history gives us confidence that we have the capability to fully recover and grow. We have faced SARS, avian flu, Sudan Red, and in every case we have bounced back. As an example, in 2005, when our China business was severely impacted by Sudan Red and avian flu, our same-store sales in KFC China were down as much as 40% during the crisis. Our full year operating profit was down 5% but we stayed the course and kept building new units. In 2006, we bounced back and reported systems sales growth of 28% and our profits grew 47%.I think this demonstrates the historical resilience of the brand. Now no two crises are the same and we don\u2019t know how long it will take us to recover. However, we expect to weather this storm and come out stronger. So let me be very clear. We will stay the course in China. We will continue to grow the business with leading brands in every significant category. We will continue to build our two big brands, KFC and Pizza Casual Dining and we will continue to invest behind Pizza Hut Home Service, Little Sheep and East Dawning. Our new unit targets remain unchanged.Now Pat Grismer will give you more color around our near-term sales expectations and our underlying assumptions in a moment. However, because our China business accounted for 42% of our profits last year and because it\u2019s clear it will take time for sales to recover, there is no question due to the sustained sharp decline in KFC China sales, we will fall well short of our targeted growth of at least 10% earnings per share growth in 2013. In fact, under our current broad assumptions, we estimate a mid-single digit EPS decline in 2013. We obviously hope to do better, faster.Putting our current short term China sales issue aside, we will continue to build shareholder value by aggressively developing new units around the world, driving same store sales growth and generating high returns on invested capital. At Yum! Restaurants International India and the United States businesses, we are well positioned to deliver against our operating profit targets and drive future growth in the years to come. I am confident our China business will bounce back strongly and lead the way to restoring our track record of double digit EPS growth in 2014, 2015 and beyond.So now let me turn it over to Rick who\u2019s going to further outline the highlights of Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S business.Richard CarucciThank you David and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to focus both of my comments today around why we believe that Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S businesses are well positioned for a successful 2013.Let me start with YRI, the division that is 90% franchised and it generates nearly half of Yum!\u2019s valuable $1.8 billion annual royalty stream. I am optimistic that YRI will have a strong 2013. We should benefit from strong development momentum from reaching scale in some key markets and from some improvements in our ownership portfolio. Overall, we are poised to capitalize on our advantage of being the global restaurant leader in emerging markets.First, let\u2019s address developments. During 2012, YRI developed a record 949 units with over 65% of them in emerging markets. We\u2019ll continue our rapid expansion in 2013 and hope to set a new record by building over 950 new units. These new units built in 2012 and 2013 should provide about 5 points of proper growth for YRI in 2013.One of the characteristics of Yum! is its strength in emerging markets. As a company, we relish the joint challenge of delivering in the short term while building for the long term. This is true in YRI\u2019s approach to emerging markets where our goal is to continually improve our foundation for future growth while also growing the business year after year. In 2012, the emerging markets grew system sales 12% including 7% new unit growth. In 2013, we are targeting similar growth building an even stronger foundation.I\u2019ll use Russia and Africa to provide some brief examples of what I mean by this. Russia is a market with huge potential. For the past two years, Russia has had the highest same store sales growth out of our 20 business units around the world. System sales grew 46% in 2012 and we opened nearly 40 new restaurants. Some of these are now company owned and are yielding good returns.After buying the business in 2010, we have converted nearly all the Rosticks units to KFC. When you look at the new branding and consider the quality of the people we have added to the Russian team, we believe that our business isn\u2019t only getting bigger, it\u2019s getting better. We\u2019re gaining more and more confidence that Russia can become a sizeable, high profit business for YRI.Let\u2019s move on to Africa, a continent with endless possibilities. As Micky Pant said in New York, Africa could become the next powerhouse economy in the world. Africa has over 1 billion people and we currently have nearly 1,000 restaurants there. That\u2019s less than one restaurant per million people compared to our 58 restaurants per million people in the U.S.During 2012, we opened almost 50 restaurants and ended the year with restaurants in 14 countries. We intend to further expand across Africa in 2013 by building restaurants in Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. By the way, these three countries combined have a population of about 90 million people. At the same time, we expect to grow our core business in South Africa where we have about 690 KFC restaurants today.Our breakfast expansion is doing great as we now have more than 270 restaurants offering breakfast and plan to add another 100 restaurants this year. Africa is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing regions, and KFC plans to be the clear restaurant leader on the continent. We are also building scale in some very large developed markets where our concepts today are significantly underpenetrated. For example we have been working hard over the past decade to reach scale in France and Germany. We have about 150 KFCs in France and about 100 KFC in Germany. We know that we have a long way to go because McDonalds has over 2500 restaurants in these two countries.However the good news for us is that we are now large enough to advertise in both countries. In France, we already have our highest average unit volumes in the world at $3.5 million a year. The France team hopes to increase this level by increasing the televised advertising from 20 weeks to 32 weeks in 2013. Germany now has enough KFC presence to justify national televised advertising for the first time. To give some perspective, when France began national advertising their sales went up over 10%. We expect strong results this year from France and Germany and together they can help drive meaningful growth for YRI in 2013 and beyond.Over the years, Yum! has always sought to improve its company ownership portfolio and the evolution of this portfolio has been an important part of our success. We sold our Pizza Hut UK Diner business to a strong franchise partner late last year. While consistent with our ownership strategy, this move also has the benefit of improving YRI profits in 2013. I am very pleased to announced today that we recently agreed the terms to acquire the operations of our franchise partner in Turkey. Turkey is another high growth emerging market with a population of 75 million people. This population is mostly urban and the median age is 29 years old. Today, Yum! has about 100 restaurants in Turkey, 60 KFCs and 40 Pizza Huts.This acquisition is subject to Turkish competition approval but is expected to close by the end of March. I thank our Turkey franchisee and our [Divine] Dallas based YRI teams for their efforts in developing this market and reaching this agreement. This transaction advances our strategy to increase the ownership in high growth, high return businesses and helps solidify our leadership in emerging markets.Overall, the Yum! Restaurant international business is on track. We had a solid 2012 and expect another year of strong performance. Our strategy remains to drive aggressive expansion and build strong brands everywhere.Now on to the United States. The U.S. as you know is an extremely competitive QSR market, where you have to play your A game every day. While the economy is certainly not robust, it is strong enough to control our own destiny. We believe that the U.S. is set up for success in 2013 because Taco Bell has momentum, because new units are now working in our favor, and because we have meaningful innovation plans at all three of our brands.Our three U.S. businesses are significantly stronger now than they were a year ago. At Taco Bell what a difference a year can make. During 2012, Taco Bell sold 325 million Doritos and Locos Tacos. That\u2019s more Tacos than there are people in the United States and makes it one of the most successful product launches in QSR history. Cantina Bell was also created in 2012 inspired by celebrity chef, Lorena Garcia. This has helped broaden the Taco Bell brand beyond its core user. I hope you all enjoyed the Taco Bell commercial during the Super Bowl which showed the country that you are never too old to live [much]. We know from our almost 10 million Facebook fans and from comments on social media, that Taco Bell is a beloved and much talked about brand today.What's important is that our 2012 Taco Bell successes should pay dividends again in 2013. Cool Ranch Doritos, Locos Tacos will be introduced in March and Cantina Bell innovation is also coming. All of this will be backed with solid operations and more media [weight]. As you heard in New York in a couple of months ago, Taco Bell aligned with their franchise system to reallocate local media to national media which resulted in more efficient advertising. For the U.S to have a successful year, it is important for our most profitable U.S brands to have a successful year and we believe we have a lot of things going in our favor at Taco Bell.Taco Bell is also following Pizza Hut\u2019s lead in going after more rural new units. The combination of a new smaller building asset design and a franchisee rural incentive should provide Taco Bell with more new units by 2014.We are also very proud that Pizza Hut added 150 net new units in the United States last year. This marks the second consecutive year of positive net unit growth after a decade of decline. The pizza brand is positioned to add a similar number of new units in 2013, given the low investment cost and high returns of our Delco Lite units. It is great to see that new unit growth is now positively contributing to our ability to grow U.S sales and profits.In the quick service restaurant business, you need value and innovation to succeed. While I talked about some of the innovation at Taco Bell, I would rather not go into much detail at Pizza Hut and KFC for competitive reasons. However, I will tell you that I believe we will have strong innovation at both Pizza Hut and KFC during 2013. I will also provide one example of product news today. Get ready for the launch of pizza sliders this week. Like burger sliders, this smaller pizza product has the potential to add new occasions to our brands. We will initially sell them in packages of three sliders and nine sliders and once consumers buy the product they will be hooked. I believe that the product will exceed our customer\u2019s expectations of quality and value.Any way you look at it, 2012 was a banner year for our U.S business. Same store sales grew 5%. Margins improved by over 4 points and operating profit grew 13%. All three brands grew same store sales. Profits grew at all three brands, with very significant profit growth at Taco Bell and KFC. However, we recognize that 2013 is an important test for us. We have said that we have positioned our businesses for more consistent results and we look forward to demonstrating that we can back up a strong year of performance in 2012 with another one 2013.Now let me hand things over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.Patrick GrismerThank you, Rick. I\u2019m pleased that 2012 marked the 11th straight year we delivered at least 13% EPS growth before special items. I\u2019m also very happy with the quality of that growth as it was largely driven by positive same store sales growth and strong operating profit performance from each of our major divisions. I\u2019m even more excited about the progress we made with new unit development as we not only set a new record for international store openings, laying a strong foundation for future growth, but also achieved positive net unit results in the U.S for the first time in over 10 years.Additionally, we returned over $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders in 2012, including nearly $1 billion in share repurchases and the eighth consecutive annual double digit percentage increase in our dividend rate. We take great pride in each one of these accomplishments as they individually drive shareholder returns. More importantly, these accomplishments collectively demonstrate the confidence we have in our ability to sustain double digit growth over the long term despite the setback we will experience in 2013 due to the current sales situation in China.Today, I\u2019ll share my thoughts on three key items. Our 2012 fourth quarter and full year results, our updated outlook for 2013 and finally, actions we\u2019re taking to drive long-term growth. First, our fourth quarter results. During the quarter, we delivered 10% EPS growth excluding special items. Adjusting for the additional week in our 2011 fiscal calendar which provided a $26 million operating profit benefit to Yum! Restaurants International and the U.S combined, we achieved 16% EPS growth on a like-for-like basis despite a very challenging quarter for our China business.I will first make a few brief remarks on the fourth quarter performance of our YRI and U.S businesses and then go into detail in China. Yum! Restaurants International had a solid quarter, opening a record 473 new units including 309 new units in emerging markets. Same store sales grew 3% with broad-based growth across our portfolio with the exceptions of continental Europe and Japan where same-store sales were generally soft. We were especially pleased with very strong same-store sales growth in Russia, Africa, Thailand and our Pizza Hut business in Korea. This new unit development and same store sales growth led to operating profit growth of 15% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the impact of our 53rd week in 2011.Fourth quarter results included an $8 million insurance recovery related to Thailand flooding in 2011, which partially offset $11 million of closed store expense related to the re-franchising of our Pizza Hut UK dining business. Moving to the U.S., we had another strong quarter with 3% same store sales growth and margin improvement of 3 percentage points. Excluding the impact of our 53rd week benefit from 2011, U.S. operating profit grew 5% versus prior year. The fourth quarter kept an absolutely outstanding year for Taco Bell with same store sales up 5% and restaurant margin up 2 percentage points.Additionally we made very good progress with our U.S. development strategy increasing our unit counts by about 100 Pizza Huts and 15 Taco Bells during the fourth quarter alone. With improved unit level economics and our new ownership strategy, our U.S. business is now firmly positioned for more consistent profit growth in the years ahead.And now China. China operating profit declined 5% for the fourth quarter prior to foreign currency translation, driven by a 6% decrease in same store sales. Given the importance of this business measure, I would like to describe how China\u2019s same store sales evolved over the course of Q4. As a reminder, China\u2019s fourth quarter encompasses four months, September through December. For the month of September, same store sales were positive for both KFC and Pizza Hut. Despite a positive start to October, both brands posted negative results for the month in the face of increasingly difficult prior year comparables and a weakening retail environment.In November, Pizza Hut responded well to a signature promotion and turned moderately positive. But KFCs slowing trend continued from October. These trends continued into the month of December. And then KFC turned sharply negative as the events unfolded in the last two weeks of the month. Our 6% same store sales decline for the quarter was composed of KFC down 8% and Pizza Hut up 7%. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margin declined 1.9 percentage points, primarily due to KFCs sharp sales decline during the last two weeks of December as well as the dilutive impact of accelerated new unit development over the year.On the subject of development, China had another exceptional quarter opening 369 restaurants. That\u2019s nearly 3 restaurant openings per day. For the full year, China opened a record 889 new units will almost half of these new units built in rapidly growing tier 3 to tier 6 cities. Our new unit development program demonstrates our strong belief in China\u2019s long term growth potential and our confidence in the capability of our China team to create significant share holder value through these investments.Now our full year results. This year\u2019s EPS growth of 13% excluding special items was driven by quality growth from all three major divisions, China, YRI, and the U.S. Each division had same store sales growth for the year and we built a record 1,976 new international units. Something we are very proud of is strong operating profit performance from each of our major divisions which drove 12 points of EPS growth. The strong performance at YRI and the outperformance in the U.S. offset the fact that we had lower than expected performance in our China division in 2012.This demonstrates the unique power of our Yum! portfolio with three global brands covering a diverse set of geographies with particular strength in emerging markets which collectively account for about 60% of our operating profit. Our overall business model is further strengthened by the $1.8 billion pretax royalty stream we generated last year, providing steady cash flow that enables ongoing investment in growth initiatives. Once our China sales rebound, we expect these unique characteristics of Yum! Brands will again support earnings growth consistency in the years ahead.As KFC China\u2019s significantly negative same store sales have continued into the New Year, our 2013 results will be significantly impacted. So let me provide you with an update on our China sales and outlook for 2013.Because we cannot predict how long it will take for KFC China sales for recover, we hesitate to provide specific financial guidance for 2013. Instead, we\u2019ll estimate 2013 results based on broad assumptions. To be clear, based on the strength of our KFC brand equity in China and based on the demonstrated resilience of our brands over time, we do expect these sales to recover. However, we simply cannot predict the recovery period with a high degree of accuracy.As you saw in our release, we estimate that our January same store sales declined 41% at KFC and 15% at pizza casual dining in China. We estimate the timing of Chinese New Year had a negative mid teen impact on January same store sales growth for our China division. We expect this negative impact of Chinese New Year to reverse in February. So assuming no change to current trends, that is no improvement in seasonally adjusted KFC China sales through the end of February and given the effect of the Chinese New Year holiday shift, we estimate that China divisions same store sales will decline by about 25% for the first quarter, with KFC significantly negative and pizza casual dining about flat.Remember, China\u2019s first quarter is composed of January and February alone and the Chinese New Year is a seasonally strong period for our business. Last year, Chinese New Year started on January 23rd whereas this year it will start February 10th.Given the uncertainty of KFC sales recovery in China, we plan to release China monthly same store sales until KFC recovers. We will begin this process with February sales which we expect to report on March 11th.This brings me to our earnings expectations for the first quarter. Even though we expect solid results from our U.S and YRI businesses in Q1, the significant decline in China same store sales will weigh very heavily on EPS growth. For the first quarter, we estimate that EPS will decline approximately 25% before special items. As you\u2019d expect, we are very disappointed with this result, but we view this as a temporary setback from which we will ultimately recover strongly.Now let me share my expectations for full year EPS. Our portfolio of businesses collectively modeled 13% annual EPS growth, including 7 percentage points from China, 3% from YRI, 1% to 2% from the U.S and 2% from financial strategies. As I mentioned earlier, our franchise business model primarily driven by our YRI and U.S businesses, contributes a steady source of cash flow of around 41.8 billion a year and we remain confident that these businesses will achieve their growth targets. If you add it up, our model delivers 6% to 7% EPS growth excluding China.Now, due to the sustained sharp decline in KFC China sales, we will fall well short of our annual target of at least 10% EPS growth in 2013. Although my confidence in our China team and the growth potential of our KFC China business is undiminished, it is difficult to predict how long sales recovery will take. Assuming that KFC China sales improve gradually throughout the year and will be positive in the fourth quarter, we estimate that China restaurant margin will be in the mid-teens and that China operating profit will be negative versus prior year. Importantly, we will stay the course in our China strategy, including investments in new unit development as we build leading brands in every significant category.Taking all of this into account, we estimate a mid-single digit EPS decline in 2013 versus prior year. Obviously, this is very disappointing news for all of us but we view 2013 as an aberration, and we are confident that we will rebound strongly with time. We are confident because we have endured setbacks before. Dave had already mentioned how in 2006 we rebounded strongly from a sharp sales decline in China in 2005. Additionally, we saw Taco Bell bounce back strongly in 2012 following a very weak 2011 affected by a bogus lawsuit and a sensational media attention that followed.Taco Bell\u2019s sales and profit resurgence in 2012 clearly demonstrate that in time, innovation and intentionality can return a brand to greatness. It\u2019s also important to note that new unit development will help to sustain the growth of our China business despite the temporary setback in same store sales. We added 889 units in 2012 and we expect to open at least 700 new units in 2013 as we indicated at our investor conference in New York. If you assumed we will add another 700 units in 2014, the 2014 impact at all this new unit development alone will add about $2 billion to our current China systems sales, or an increase of about 25%.While it is way too early to know what will happen to same store sales or margin levels in 2014, it sure is good to know that the China development engine will help to blunt the impact of the same store sales decline we will experience in 2013. Finally, let me talk about the actions we are taking to drive our long term business model including our continued focus on new unit development.First, as in any year, our primary focus is building shareholder value so we will continue to invest behind future growth opportunities. We are staying the course and will not change how we grow our businesses while doing everything possible to reverse the negative sales trends with KFC in China. Although this will be a very challenging year for Yum!, we will make the right decisions for our business long term. What we will not do is sacrifice our long term growth model in an effort to make one year\u2019s bad EPS number a little bit better.Our growth model is driven by new unit development, same store sales growth and high returns. We are staying the course with our long term growth strategy and will continue to use excess cash to invest behind the growth we see in the business and then return all remaining cash through dividends and share purchases. Our investment in new unit development is skewed towards high growth emerging markets such as China, India, Russia and Africa. And we will use 2013 to further strengthen our foundation in all of these markets including China.We continue to believe that China is the number one retail opportunity in the world and we will continue to capitalize on this growth opportunity. However, as outlined at our December investor conference, we are shifting our China development focus towards lower tier cities where restaurant margins and investment returns are higher. In our India division, we built 138 new units this year, in including 80 KFCs. This is the second year in a row we have built over 100 new units and we expect that number to grow as we build even more people capability in India. We will continue to invest behind our powerful brands in India and we expect this business to be the next big growth engine for Yum! within the next two to three years.At YRI, we will invest behind high growth markets and accelerate new unit development of both KFC and Pizza Hut, particularly in the rapidly growing Pizza delivery space. And finally, driven by the powerful economics of our Pizza Hut Delco Lite and the improved returns on Taco Bell units, we expect that units in the U.S. will be net unit positive again in 2013. In conclusion, we realize 2013 will be a very challenging year for Yum! But our brands are resilient and I am confident that KFCs sales will recover in China as we rebuild consumers trust in our brand. Despite this setback our growth model remains intact and is designed to deliver double-digit EPS growth for many years to come.And with that I will turn it back over to Dave.David NovakOkay. Thank you very much, Pat, appreciate it. So let me wrap up leaving you with our three key messages. Number one, in the short term, any way you look at it, 2013 will be an extremely disappointing year from an EPS standpoint because of KFC China. We ultimately expect a full recovery, but can\u2019t tell you exactly when. We will post you of our sales progress every month until we get KFC China back on track. At the same time, you need to know, given our confidence, it\u2019s full speed ahead with developments this year in China.I said in New York, when you think of KFC in China, think about McDonald\u2019s in the United States. Everywhere you go in the United States in every county seat in America, you will see a McDonald\u2019s in the very best locations. I\u2019m talking about towns like Chillicothe, Missouri to Hutchinson, Kansas. McDonald\u2019s is literally everywhere and it\u2019s clearly the CSR leader in the United States. They had first in advantage and everyone pales in comparison.In the United States, McDonald\u2019s has 14,000 traditional units in a population of over 310 million. We expect to have at least that many units in China with the consuming class growing from 300 million to 600 million over time and disposable income growing along with it. We will be everywhere that matters in China and have the best locations in every town.Now as I said before, we will inevitably have a challenging year in China and unfortunately 2013 is that year. But every day I wake up, I\u2019m glad we have the business we do. I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 trade places with anyone. Our strategy and capability to build leading brands in China and tap into the number one growth market in the world is simply unparalleled. Number two, in the longer term, we fully expect to return to achieving our annual target of at least 10%. With 2014, the expectation will be a big bounce back year. We believe as strongly as ever Yum! Is uniquely positioned to grow aggressively around the world. Importantly, we continue to strengthen our brands and the processes that ensure success so we become an even stronger company down the road. And number three, this business is a business with endless possibilities. We have growth opportunities staring us in the face in China, emerging markets and now the United States. We will continue with confidence our quest to build the defining global company that feeds the world.So thank you very much and we look forward to answering any and all questions that you have.Timothy JerzykOkay. Mishei, we\u2019re ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions). And your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorganThe sense of what you really could have done differently in this case in terms of the antibiotics that were entering into your chicken supply at all and what prevents that in the future. In other words, are you being asked to do inspection at the farmer level which I can\u2019t imagine? Are you responsible for inspection at the supplier level which quite frankly I thought was the responsibility of different authorities or is it just a process to where you and the government need to communicate more? In other words what really is the process of remediation that prevents this from happening in the foreseeable future?David NovakHey John. I think the beginning of your question got cut off on our end. Can you \u2013 sorry to ask you to redo that, but if you could restate your question that would be helpful to us, the first part.John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorganApologies. The question really centers around what you could have done differently to prevent this. David, you made a comment about learning from history and is it, gosh, if we had more people in the field from an inspection point, if you\u2019re doing inspection at the farmer level which I have a hard time believing that\u2019s your responsibility. Was it your responsibility to do more inspections at the supplier level, which I thought was the responsibility of different authorities? So the question that I have is what is changing specifically within Yum! For an issue like this, whether chicken or related to anything else in your supply chain for not occurring again.David NovakWell, okay John. I think first of all I want to make it really clear that food safety is our top priority and you know we do everything we can to make sure our food is safe and is of the highest quality. We have a global protocol for (inaudible) suppliers on food safety and in quality assurance. And if issues are identified in any case we always take appropriate measures to require our suppliers to immediately rectify the problem. If a supplier does not meet our strict QA standards, we simply will not do business with them. What we are doing is we are continuing to invest in QA around the world and work with suppliers and world renowned outside QA experts to improve our practices.We are doing this all around the world and what we are doing in China is we are going to take our processes to an even higher level and strengthen our QA processes going forward.John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorganAnd I am sure you can appreciate me if you need pressing on this, I mean that was I think everyone\u2019s understanding and belief. And I thought it was a fact that that was already done in China and the fact what you are doing in China was considered to be best in class at Yum!, or best in class quite frankly relative to anyone. So what prevents this from happening in the future? Just doing more of what you have been doing or are you being asked to do some of the job of, quite frankly, what I thought was the responsibility of the authorities?David NovakWhat we are doing is, first of all KFC is the leader in China as you say. We have been the leader in food safety protocols and practices in the past. And that\u2019s a high responsibility and one that we take we seriously as we go forward. Our objective in China is to strengthen our poultry supply chain practices. And this will include improved voluntary self-testing procedures. We do self-testings, we are going to improve that and do it even better. This is above and beyond anything that is required by any laws or regulations. We are going to improve our reporting processes and communications and we are going to enhance our supplier management.What we are working on right with our suppliers is a comprehensive QA program that will be even better than what we think was the world class process. And bottom line is, we will focus on making sure we do everything we can to be the very best in this area. So we will be announcing that shortly after Chinese New Year, the comprehensive QA program and a marketing campaign that will also supplement it.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Davenport and Company.Jeff Omohundro - Davenport and CompanyMy question relates to the branding efforts to rebuild consumer trust in China. You have mentioned, couple of times you have dealt with similar issues both in China and the U.S. Could you talk a little bit further about the specifics around the efforts, around the spending against these efforts and how broad these efforts might me, including for example, social media and other avenues.David NovakWell, first of all, it starts with the basis that we have a powerful brand that\u2019s extremely popular and people lover our food and they love the experience and we have got a great strength to build on. I think as far as the marketing goes one of the things we have realize is that in any case, regardless of how strong your brand is, it\u2019s going to take time. Because consumers have lots of options that they can go to and I think what we have right now is we literally have to weather the storm of a lot of adverse publicity that is clearly top of mind with customers.So I don\u2019t think there is any marketing we can do today that is going to change what is going on right now because we do need the gift of time. Having said that, we are working very aggressively to develop a superior program with our suppliers on the quality assurance front and we are working on an advertising and marketing approach that will communicate this to the customer. From everything to [trade liners] to ways that we (inaudible) social media, everything which you can basically imagine. One of the things we do have with KFC is we have a big budget. Last year we opened up 900 more restaurants. So we have lots of medias. We have all the capability we need to continue to build the brand the right way, and we will do that.So we will be launching a new program around quality and what we are doing with our suppliers, communicating the press, communicating it over all the social media, and we will launch that shortly after the Chinese new year, but in terms of marketing clout, we go in with more marketing clout just simply by the nature of we do have 900 more stores as we go forward and we have all the marketing clout to make us one of the top advertisers in China and we have every capability to be able to get our message out. But I did think what we need more than anything and Sam Su and I have looked at lots of different options and we\u2019ve talked about this daily is we really need to get the time and I think over time we will come back because this is a powerful brand that\u2019s loved by consumers and we will prevail in the end.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. BairdA question on China. As you think about the actions you need to take to restore confidence in the consumer picture and what is needed to strengthen the business model there, are there any structural changes to the expense structure that need to be made, for example, maybe greater spending on quality assurance or perhaps more focus on value and less margin at the restaurant level? Anything along those lines would be helpful.David NovakWe don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s material at this point to talk about.David Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. BairdOkay, great. And then maybe a quick follow-up to the last question. David, you mentioned that on the marketing picture you had plenty of dollars to spend. Just curious to know your thoughts on whether you would actually allocate a higher level of spending temporarily to try to accelerate the recovery.David NovakWe don\u2019t think that there needs to be a material change in our overall market expense to make that happen. Just to put it in perspective, I think we have a marketing budget around $400 million. So that\u2019s a lot of tier rating points you can buy and a lot of things that we can do. So like I said we have all the capability to come back over time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.Keith Siegner - Credit SuisseA question for you, maybe a little more color on the mid-teens company restaurant margin target for China for this year, just maybe some details on the big moving pieces, like if we think about pricing to start, should we think of pricing or incremental pricing as off the table for this year? And then in terms of inflation, what\u2019s the update to the commodity outlook? Is chicken cheaper now given that there is so much less demand? Has the labor inflation picture changed? And if there is anything really stand out in terms of things like sales-based rent contracts and that flexing either way, any of the big picture moving pieces on the margins would be really helpful. Thanks.Patrick GrismerAbsolutely, Keith. First of all on the cost side, we\u2019re not seeing any material change to the guidance we provided in New York, specifically with respect to food, labor and rent. The biggest driver of margin pressure is the same store transaction decline and that weighed heavily on us in the fourth quarter and we see that continuing into 2013. What we said as you know is that we expect same store sales to be down 25%, about 25% in the first quarter and that we expect those sales to turn positive in the fourth quarter. I won\u2019t get into the exact slope of the recovery or the extent of the rebound in any given quarter because I don\u2019t think it makes sense here, but what all of that implies is that on a full year basis same-store sales will be down in the mid-single digits. And as you\u2019d expect, the impact to same-store transactions is more significant, probably high singles digit declines and it is the transaction deleverage associated with that sales outcome that is putting the most pressure on margins and it contributes to what we\u2019ve guided under the scenario is a mid-teen margin.Now, you asked specifically about pricing. That is something that we will evaluate throughout the year. Simply based on the actions we took in 2012, there\u2019s a rollover pricing benefit of about 2 points. There could be opportunity depending on what we\u2019re marketing throughout the year to take additional pricing, but we\u2019ve not made any specific assumptions at this time around that. So the primary driver in addition to what we guided in New York around inflation principally for labor but also for food, combined with the transaction deleverage because of the same store sales decline is what will yield what we\u2019ve outlooked is a mid-teen margin for our China business in 2013.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley.John Glass - Morgan StanleyCan you just talk about what else is going on in China and specifically, obviously, before this happened there was a 4% decline in sales. There was something else going underneath that and then when you look at the Pizza Hut numbers you are expecting in the first quarter, flat ex the Chinese New year shift. That\u2019s a deceleration. One, is that just the -- do you think there was a brand spillover that\u2019s occurring to that brand or is there no association. If there is no association, what else do you think is going on there at that brand as your macro issue as well.David NovakJohn, we don\u2019t see any spillover effect of the KFC crisis on to Pizza Hut. You recall from our New York investor conference that we talked about the decelerating trend we saw across our business in the back half of last year. And that was implicit in the updated sales guidance that we provided ahead of the investor conference. And we attributed that as you will recall to the fact that we were facing increasingly difficult comparables from the prior year on top of the fact that we were seeing some weakness in our broader retail environment and that was impacting both brands.We saw the decelerating trend across the back half of last year. Now in addition to that you have to bear in mind that as we enter 2013, we are continuing to face significant comparables from prior year. For Pizza Hut alone in the first quarter we recorded 18% same store sales growth in 2012.John Glass - Morgan StanleyOkay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the question about your anticipation of commodity inflation labor etcetera. Why wouldn\u2019t you see greater commodity pressure? I am assuming there is going to be other suppliers that are either going to raise their prices because they have got some higher regulatory burden. They are going to have chicken that is compliant with the regulations and that\u2019s going to be more valuable in the market place. So why wouldn\u2019t you expect to see an uptick in commodity inflation due to this episode.David NovakWe are taking a look at the situation with our team in China and we don\u2019t expect at this stage that there is going to be a material effect.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.Andy Barish - JefferiesMay be shift over to the U.S. business and Taco Bell. Can you give us kind of broad brush stroke again on the, sort of the reallocation and the increases in marketing and obviously the 2Q is a big lap with the DLT rollout from last year. Anything we should be thinking about in terms of quarterly volatility in Taco Bell? Are you planning for that with new products?David NovakWell, again, what we did at Taco Bell, we used to have 2.5% national advertising and 4.5% total advertising. The deal that we struck with the franchisees is we lowered the total cost of 4.25% advertising but then it all goes to international. And when you do the math on that, it increases the media rates considerably because of the greater efficiency of national advertising. So we think that will be a good tailwind throughout 2013.Regarding quarterly stuff at Taco Bell, I would just say that one think to keep in mind is that we had a very strong second quarter last year when we were, one, wrapping the bogus law suit from 2011 but also launching the Doritos, Locos Tacos. So we had a very large Q2 last year of 13%. So that will be sort of the toughest overlap. In the rest of the quarter I don\u2019t see a lot of, necessarily, movement right now. Like I said at the beginning that this would impact Taco Bell but also some of the other brands. We are not seeing a robust economy right now but we think it\u2019s good enough. In the quick service industry we think it\u2019s a good enough economy where if we have the right innovation, the right value, we will be successful.But it is also what I call the rocky recovery. As an example of that, the last week of January, you saw the industry we think was down about 4 points because you were at the end of the pay cycle. Both monthly payers and bi-weekly paychecks, were both coming due at the very end of January. So it\u2019s just sort of the heads-up that you have to play your A game in this business and I believe Taco Bell in particular is playing their A game.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill LynchAgain a couple of questions on China. Looking again at the fourth-quarter negative trend before the chicken supply kicked in, it seems like it was more concentrated at KFC. Do you think there were pricing value differences year-over-year that contributed to that softness, pre the chicken supply issue?David NovakWell, as we said in New York, Joe, we don't believe the pricing really had an impact on the traffic growth. We measure very carefully the impact of pricing as we roll over \u2013 we had a new pricing system we rolled out, increasing the numbers of tiers to 12, if you recall, and rolling through the price increases in a very targeted fashion and somewhat slowly. And this was spent deliberately in order to really assess the impact on the transactions. And over that period of time we did not see a slowdown in the transactions. And at the same time we look at consumer metrics every single month and our consumer metrics in 2012, the metrics on value really hadn\u2019t changed. So we're maintaining a very strong value position. So we don't believe that the pricing's really in play in terms of what we saw in terms of our transaction. So that's how we're looking at it.Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay. And then again kind of a broad question and a couple of slices of this have been asked, but how do you think about the implications of this event, this experience with the chicken supply issue beyond 2013? Will there be changes in the supply chain or government relations or public perception of brand or even Chinese consumer behavior around chicken?David NovakWell, I think as I\u2019ve said before, we are basically \u2013 we're not really looking to have vertical integration. We're concentrating ourselves in the sense of us owning and running chicken farms and chickens supply. We're concentrating on vertical integration at the supplier lever with world class suppliers because frankly given our scale we need multiple sources for chicken. I think what we're doing is we're working 24/7 right now to develop an even more comprehensive, even more enhanced QA system that will give our customers the products that they are looking for from KFC.Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill LynchOkay. And then just one last one. So YRI fourth quarter comp, I think you guided to plus 4, came in plus 3. Does that variance reflect any spillover of the China into other Asian markets?Patrick GrismerNo. It was closed between 3 and 4 when we guided 4 and we ended up at 3 or just the\u2026OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management.Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk ManagementThe months it took you to recover from the\u2026David NovakI\u2019m sorry, Howard. Can you start over again? We didn\u2019t hear the beginning.Howard Penney - Hedgeye Risk ManagementSorry. That seems to be a pattern here. Do you happen to have the number of months it took for you to recover from SARS, Sudan Red and avian flu in order to benchmark your progress and recovery for this debacle?Richard CarucciHoward, as we look back at how event unfolded in 2005 into 2006, we saw recovery from Sudan Red over a period of six to seven months, but it was at that time then that we were hit with the SARS crisis which extended the recovery out to 12. So there were couple of \u2013 12 months. So there were a couple of events happening at that period of time. And as David has said, there are no two crises that are the same. Each one is very unique and as we\u2019ve come up with a scenario to provide you for how this might play out over the next year, we\u2019ve landed on the scenario of nine to 12 months which is why we\u2019ve suggested as part of this scenario that gets us to a mid-single-digit EPS decline, that we will see same-store store sales turn positive in the fourth quarter.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.Brian Bittner \u2013 OppenheimerThanks very much. I think we all definitely appreciate this enhanced disclosure that you guys are going to be providing on a monthly basis and also definitely appreciate your attempt to, I guess, kind of still get to meet your 2013 EPS guidance. But with this lack of visibility, I mean why you have been kind of communicating the potential positive comps in the fourth quarter because given that\u2019s about a third of the year, that\u2019s going to be so impactful to what you ultimately end up doing this year on the EPS front. And it seems as though with comps still down 25% despite you facing a much easier comparison, a lot of optimism goes into that. So where the confidence really come from to just throw out positive things for sale expectations for the fourth quarter.Patrick GrismerWell, we feel that it\u2019s important to provide some direction versus no direction. We said before that is very difficult, it\u2019s not impossible to predict how this is going to play out. We do look to history to see how our business has performed during other crises. Again, no two crises are the same. But as I mentioned in response to the last question, as we looked at 2005 and into 2006, we felt that it was reasonable to make assumptions that establish a basis for a scenario to give some indication as to how EPS might play out. And that includes an assumption around when same store sales turn positive, and we do take into account as you mention, overlapping from the prior year from one quarter to the next. That is our base case assumption, if you will. We are necessarily characterizing that as a prediction.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA.Diane Geissler - CLSASo I wanted to ask about what the thought process was about the delay between when you receive the final sign-off from the government and when you plan to be back with the media campaign. Just seems like you missed an opportunity to get the message out before the Chinese New Year. And then also, could you comment on what you might have seen in terms of traffic, sort of outside of the you know the Shanghai radius, where I think most of the media attention was focused. Maybe you could talk about other tier one and tier two cities, and then tier three and lower. What did traffic patterns looked like since the start of the year or following the media reports?Richard CarucciYeah, Diane, I'll respond to the second half of your question and David will follow in response to the first part of your question. As you would expect, the impact to our business was much more pronounced in Shanghai itself, which was the focus of the media attention and generally speaking was more pronounced in the higher tier cities than in the lower tier cities.David NovakAnd I think, first, we totally underestimated the impact of this incident. Then we very quickly launched a free beverage and ice cream promotion that had very little impact. And the reality as we concluded is, the consumer needs time and I think the team you should know is working 24/7 with all kinds of urgency on a comprehensive QA and marketing campaign we'll launch shortly after Chinese New Year. So I think we've done a lot of things. We've been on top of this situation daily and I think basically there is not a whole lot we can do right now that\u2019s going to turn the tide. We need some time. History has also told us we need time and I think we could be wasting a lot of money doing marketing right now. We need to get to time.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason West with Deutsche Bank.Jason West - Deutsche BankSo, on the margin outlook for China just getting to that mid-teens restaurant margins. I\u2019m kind of struggling to get there on a negative comp for the year, and just wondering if there are some cost offsets that we are not aware of? Maybe there is some management of G&A or labor that you guys can control, just in light of the inflation that you guided in December. It's tough to get to kind of a mid-teens margin on these kind of comps?Patrick GrismerAs I mentioned the transaction deleverage is significant and you have seen the effect in our Q4 margin, you may recall that we had expected to see improvement in Q4 margin versus prior year and in Feb we saw a pretty significant decline and it was the transaction to leverage associated with the same-store sales decline in the last two weeks of December that contributed heavily to that result and we expect that that will persist into 2013 as long as we are seeing that same-store transaction decline. Bear in mind that the downside leverage is significant, but at the same time when our sales rebound, the upside leverage is equally significant. But that is the primary driver, along with the inflation that we already communicated with respect to both labor inflation being in the mid-teens and food inflation being in low single-digits.So that explains or it helps provide some additional color around why we feel under this particular set of assumptions or the sale scenario that China restaurant margin will be in the mid-teens. As it relates to overall profitability, the other thing to bear in mind is that we are staying the course as it relates to investment behind growth. And that applies not only to the investment in new unit development, again at least 700 new units in China in 2013 as we guided in the New York, but also investments in G&A to continue to build the capability necessary to unlock those growth opportunities.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Larry Miller with RBC.Larry Miller \u2013 RBCJust two quick questions. I think you guys mentioned the media intensity has subsided. Have you seen same-store sales bottom and begin to recover? And then secondly, is there any way for you to give us a sense of chicken consumption in general in China or is it just your belief that it's more centered on you guys?Patrick GrismerLarry, first of all, with respect to the sales trend, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, we are not expecting to see a change in trend from what we saw in December into January. We are assuming for the moment that that continues to the end of February. So, the way I would read that is that while the sales situation hasn't gotten better, it hasn't gotten any worse either. With respect to impact to poultry consumption generally I don't know. What we do know is that KFC has received a lot of attention, has been the target of a lot of negative media attention and that has driven the result that we saw in the last two weeks of December and that has continued into this year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 BarclaysThank you very much. Just specific to China as you think out over the next number of years, obviously the returns have been strong historically and the company operated model allowed you to benefit from the returns and you built the long-term brand and the infrastructure to take advantage of the opportunity, but I think most of us think of you as a global franchisor over time and investors obviously appreciate the YRI model, which you've talked about on a couple occasions of the installation, and I think people would expect the shift over time maybe in China to that type of model. So the question being, with the scares unfortunately more frequent than desired and the volatility that we've seen from that company-operated model, does it give you any reason to consider at least removing some of the company-operated exposure and related deleverage? Or if this type of rationale doesn't do it, would there be any rationale that would lead you to perhaps start to refranchise and jut benefit from that installation?David NovakFrom day one, we've always had a strategy to earn the right to own, and where we want to put company equity is where we have great returns. We continue to have great returns in China in three year cash-on-cash returns. Even in tier one cities it's three to four years now. So across the board we have outstanding returns in China. We have great operating capability and we expect to be predominantly equity in China. Having said that, we are doing some franchising selectively with really good operators, some with people who've worked in our system, store-by-store kind of a model, but we don't see that as a \u2013 we don't see a big shift whatsoever, because we\u2019re just so confident in the long-term returns that we have in China.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS.Eric Gonzalez \u2013 UBSHi guys. This is Eric Gonzalez in for David Palmer. Just have a question about maybe how this antibiotic been such a big deal to Chinese customers. What is being said in the Chinese press about KFC and it's chicken supply that is true and untrue? And what can Yum! China specifically say that can help restore the trust in the brand?David NovakWell, I think some -- there\u2019s been some questions about the growth cycle that we have for our chickens or our suppliers have our chicken, which is 45 days. And frankly these things come up from time to time everywhere, but the 45 days is basically our global standard. Frankly, we simply thought this was a non-issue. Then the CCTV story broke and things started to spiral down shortly followed up by the Shanghai FDA investigation. So I think anytime you have any kind of questions anywhere about your food, it creates an issue and a doubt in consumers mind. And bottom line is, there are lots of places to eat. As much as we love KFC, you don't have to go there tomorrow. I mean you can let this thing settle in or take some time to reflect on this and then you go back to the brand and the products that you love, and you want to have as a part of your life.So, I think once again what we are doing about this is, number one, is we know we need some time. And the team is taking this as an opportunity to develop an even more enhanced and even more comprehensive QA program and then we are going to begin communicating to consumers what we've done to make our processes and systems even stronger. And as we do this, we are going to continue to market the brand. We'll have product innovation, like we always do. We'll have marketing commercials. We still have Germany win. We have a lot of things that really make us a cool hit brand in China and we've been locally relevant for years and we are going to stay locally relevant as we go into the future. So, I think what we are going to do is just what I told you.Eric Gonzalez \u2013 UBSAnd just real quick as a follow-up. Have you considered maybe making some fundamental changes to your supply chain, consolidating your suppliers using fewer suppliers?David NovakWell, I think what we are concentrating on, as I mentioned, is vertical integration at the supplier level with world-class suppliers. And we are going to hone in on the real core suppliers, developing that network, making sure that they are world class, investing with them, helping them, sharing whatever we can to ensure that we get the very best products. So, that's how we're handling it.Timothy JerzykMishei, Before we go to next question, I just wanted to clarify one thing for all those on the call. The mid-teens margin that Pat mentioned earlier is company restaurant margin. So just wanted to clarify that. So, Mishei, can we take the next question, please.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.Michael Kelter - Goldman SachsI wanted to ask for a little more of a history lesson about your China experience in 2005, Sudan Red, avian flu issue. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, negative 40% same-store sales I think. How long was that sustained for and what was your plan to improve the brand image at that time and when you did recover to positive double-digits, was it driven by any company specific initiatives like new product news or was it just the benefit of time elapse and just a brand image recovery?Patrick GrismerMichael, just to provide a bit more color around that. The negative 40% was the lowest point that sustained for maybe a couple of weeks and we began to see improvements in the first 30 days or so. And then as I mentioned, as we were finally turning positive from that event about six months later, than we saw the impact of avian flu. In terms of what we did at the time in order to bring back sales, very similar to I know what we have in store now as David mentioned. Which is product news, demonstrating innovation that will bring customers back into their restaurant while also talking about the strength of our brand and rebuilding trust in the quality of our food. So, the plans are generally similar to what we had done seven years ago.David NovakMichael, just (inaudible) is a historian in the room. One of the differences is when Sudan Red occurred, the media attention was very significant, probably maybe even worse than this, but for a shorter period of time. It was in the news for about a week or two. As David said in his remarks, the media attention this time lasted as a lot longer than we expected with the combination of CCTV and the Shanghai FDA and social media, which wasn\u2019t prominent back then. So we're glad that that's beginning to wind down, but that is a difference is in the two events.Michael Kelter - Goldman SachsAnd then I wanted to revisit one more time a question that was already asked, but maybe ask it in a little different way. The updated guidance or estimate of down mid-single-digit seems \u2013 earnings, which is underpinned by the assumption of positive comps in China in the fourth quarter. Since only two weeks of the four months quarter are easy compares from this chicken issue, doesn't that assumption imply that you\u2019re thinking the 25% of consumers that you've lost mostly all come back before the end of the year and doesn't that base case invite the risk that you have to come back to us with another downward revision in the future?", "Patrick GrismerWell, as I mentioned to you, what we provided is an assumption to explain some basis for an outlook we are not again characterizing as a prediction because it is impossible to predict in this environment. But as we expect sales to turn positive in the fourth quarter, which we think is a reasonable assumption again based on what we\u2019ve seen in the past, based on the strength of our KFC brand, that's how the numbers come together.", "David NovakBut I think Michael, bottom line is we don't know what we don't know. But I think we talked about should we even give any guidance. We felt that we would be better off given you broad assumptions and that's what we've done.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham ResearchI\u2019d like to ask about the new store performance and obviously there is a lot of noise right now, but you did maintain your unit development target for 2013. I guess I would think that the new store sales have been affected somewhat. Can you comment, is it the same degree as the existing stores and maybe bigger picture, could you just give us a sense of how you assess new store performance in this environment to give us a sense that maintaining this level of unit growth is the right move?Richard CarucciWe've always taken a long-term view on our business. So as we expect this situation to be temporary or short-lived, while yes, the impact to sales will affect the near-term returns we are seeing on these investments, we don't see that as a reason to deviate from our long-term growth strategy. We did not see or we have not seen a material difference in the sales impact to new units versus core units, although as I said earlier in response to a question that Diane had raised, we did see a more pronounced impact on units generally in Shanghai, as you'd expect, and broadly more pronounced in higher tier cities versus lower tier cities. But again, fully expecting that the sales will recover, we see this impact to new unit returns in the near-term to not be reason to deviate from our long-term growth strategy for China.Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham ResearchGreat, thanks. And if I could just slip one last question in, just to follow-up on a previous question, it sounds like that we should not expect any step up function in supervision or advertising as a percent of sales on an ongoing basis. Can you maybe explain how that could be? It just seems like that you will have to invest in these types of things to restore confidence, but it doesn't seem like you view it as a step up function. You are just going to reallocate other resources?Patrick GrismerI think the fact is Mitch, we have a $400 million marketing budget. That's a huge amount of effort and we always believe that your money is best spent when you focus it on what consumer perceptions, habits, beliefs you have to change, build, or reinforce the business. So we think every dollar we spend behind reinforcing what we're doing to enhance our quality and it's a dollar well spent that will drive the best possible return for our investors. So we're very comfortable that we have everything we need.David NovakOkay. Thank you guys for your questions. Appreciate it very much. Let me wrap this up. There is absolutely no question we have taken a tough blow, but we have performed well in adverse situations in the past and we are committed to do it again. This is the same business with the same opportunities we talked to you about at our investor conference in New York just two months ago. Any way you look at it, we are still on the ground floor of global growth in China and a whole lot more. So we're very confident about the future and thank you for taking the time. Appreciate it.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Brands first quarter 2013 earnings conference call.  [Operator instructions.]  Mr. Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin the conference.", "Steve Schmitt", "Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our earnings call. This call is being recorded and will be available for playback. We are broadcasting the conference call via our website, www.yum.com. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and any future use of the recording.", "I would also like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.", "In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands\u2019 website to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call. Finally, we would like you to please be aware of the following Yum! investor events occurring in the next three mos. Our April same-store sales release for our China division will be May 10, after market hours.  Our Taco Bell investor analyst conference will be May 21 in Irvine, California.  And our second quarter earnings release will be Wednesday, July 10.  ", "On our call today is David Novak, Chairman and CEO; Rick Carucci, President; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from each, we will take your questions.", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak ", "Thank you Steve, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call.  While better than expected, the first quarter was extremely difficult for Yum! Brands.  As anticipated, intense media attention surrounding poultry supply in China significantly impacted KFC\u2019s sales and profits.  Earnings per share declined 8% versus prior year, as our China division operating profit fell 41%.  Operating profit increased 19% at Yum! Restaurants International and 5% in our U.S. business.  ", "While we\u2019re certainly not happy with our overall results, as we look at how our China sales evolved through March, we were making progress and it was pretty close to where we thought we\u2019d be.  Unfortunately, our quest for a full sales recovery has been dampened by the intense publicity of avian flu in China, beginning in early April.", "Now the last time we were significantly impacted by avian flu was in 2005.  The sales impact was initially dramatic at KFC, but relatively short lived, lasting about three months.  We anticipate this will once again be the case, but there\u2019s no way to be certain.  ", "Based on our results through the first three weeks of April, we expect China division same-store sales will be down about 30% for the month.  You will see the actual numbers in our sales release scheduled for May 10.", "Putting the avian flu situation aside, I\u2019d like to share some of what the team in China is doing to restore consumer trust in the KFC brand and to enhance our industry leading supply chain practices.  Immediately after the Chinese New Year, in late February, we launched what we\u2019re calling Operation Thunder.  To the Chinese consumer, this signifies swift, decisive action, which is exactly what we\u2019re doing to address consumer perceptions related to the safety of our chicken in China.", "As part of this initiative, we announced several enhancements we\u2019re making to our supply chain.  One specific enhancement was to work with our suppliers to eliminate over 1,000 small and less modern chicken houses, where risk could be the highest.  We want our suppliers to only work with the most sophisticated chicken farms in China.", "We also launched an aggressive quality assurance program including 30-second television commercials.  Our strategy is to build as much awareness as possible of our industry leading quality assurance processes.  Our research indicates the more people hear about what we\u2019re doing, the more willing they are to come back into our restaurants.", "Additionally, we are continuing to build the KFC brand with major news around value and innovation.  Our goal is to come out of this stronger than ever on our food safety perceptions in China and get sales back on track as fast as possible.  ", "These are certainly trying times for our KFC China business, but I want to be crystal clear that we do expect a complete sales recovery.  In previous years, we have faced SARS, Sudan Red, and previous avian flu situations, and in every case, we have bounced back.  And when sales do come back, we\u2019re going to benefit from the additional 1,600 restaurants we\u2019ll have built during 2012 and 2013.", "We have a world-class team, an unmatched distribution system, and industry-leading advertising resources.  KFC is a powerful and resilient brand that is loved throughout China.  We expect to bounce back stronger than ever.", "We think staying the course on at least 700 new units is the right number, recognizing we are still out-developing competition by a wide margin, still have first mover advantage by entering over 100 new cities, and have no urgency to expand more rapidly in the current environment.  And remember, this means we will open about 1,600 new units in two years.  There\u2019s no question we are continuing to capitalize on the number one retail opportunity in the world.  ", "As I have mentioned before, the most positive new news in recent years at Yum! is the incredible performance of Pizza Hut casual dining in China.  We continue to have less than three year cash paybacks, and are successfully expanding across lower tier cities.  While sales started a bit slow in the first quarter, we are pleased that March same-store sales grew 4%.  We have major product news with [Stone Fan Steak] this year, and we\u2019re beginning to expand breakfast into more cities.  We\u2019re very bullish on pizza and casual dining this year, and in the years to come.  ", "Overall in China, we\u2019re going to stay the course with our strategy to have leading brands in every significant category.  We will continue to build our two big brands, KFC and Pizza Hut casual dining, and we will continue to invest in pizza at home service, Little Sheep, East Dawning, and we opened 226 new units in our first quarter and are well on our way to open at least 700 restaurants this year, which again, we believe is a very good number.  ", "Outside of China, we expect solid on-target performance for Yum! Brands, and as I evaluate our strategies, I\u2019ve concluded that just like China, we have the right strategies in place, and the best thing we can do for our shareholders is to stay the course with what we\u2019ve been focusing on.  We\u2019re very focused to be the emerging market leader in the restaurant category, and positioned for growth in so many countries around the world.", "At Yum! Restaurants International, we\u2019re going to continue with our strategy to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere.  Our new unit pipeline has never been stronger.  We expect to open over 950 new restaurants this year, and grow operating profit consistent with our ongoing growth model of at least 10%.", "And I\u2019m very pleased that our U.S. business will be a net new unit developer for the second consecutive year.  Importantly, Taco Bell, which represents about 60% of our U.S. profit, had a strong first quarter and continues to have success building on its Doritos Locos Tacos and Cantina Bell platforms.  We expect our U.S. profits to grow in line with our ongoing growth model of 5%.  Finally, we\u2019re investing and developing a great business in India, which will drive substantial future growth for Yum!  ", "So to wrap this up, 2013 is obviously going to be a difficult year for Yum! Brands due to our challenges with KFC in China.  Our Yum! Restaurants International and U.S. businesses are well-positioned to deliver against our growth targets and drive future growth for years to come.", "I\u2019m confident that our China business will bounce back strongly and lead the way to restoring our track record of consistently delivering double digit EPS growth in 2014, 2015, and beyond.", "Now Rick Carucci will take you through our strategies for Yum! Restaurants International and the U.S. business.", "Richard Carucci  ", "Thank you, David.  Good morning everyone.  At Yum! Restaurants International, our strategy remains to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere.  What I would like to do today is review the nature of our growth.  ", "The growth from YRI continues to be driven by our franchisees and our strength in emerging markets.  In 2013, you will see that our equity presence in select emerging markets will also contribute to this growth.  ", "One characteristic that we love about YRI is the recurring and growing nature of its franchise fees.  These franchise fees will approach nearly $1 billion in 2013, which represents 10% growth versus 2012.  Our franchisees are investing heavily behind our KFC and Pizza Hut brands and are aggressively building new units.", "During the first quarter, we developed 147 new units, and 90% of these units were opened by franchisees.  We continue our rapid pace of expansion throughout the year, and expect to set a record by building over 950 new units in 2013.", "This franchise growth provides a large cash stream for Yum!  It also generates significant value for our shareholders.  We believe that the capital free franchise business at YRI is unique, given that it provides income and cash that is large, growing, global, and diversified.  ", "We\u2019re delighted to be meeting with over 500 of these franchisees, representing over 100 countries, at our upcoming biannual franchise convention in Beijing, where we will discuss our strategies and initiatives.  We look forward to working together with our franchisees to develop even more profitable growth opportunities in the years ahead.  ", "As we have said before, Yum! is the clear leader in emerging markets.  70% of the new YRI units in the first quarter were in emerging markets.  The bulk of the emerging market business will continue to be led by franchisees.  ", "However, over the last few years, we have also developed a company-owned presence in some select high-growth countries.  These include Russia, South Africa, and Turkey.  Three years ago, we had no company-owned restaurants in these markets.  Today we now have about 230 company units.    ", "We are bullish on all three of these markets.  Over the past two years, Russia has led our entire system in same-store sales growth.  This continues to be the case so far in 2013, where Russia posted system sales growth of 45% in the most recent quarter, driven by development and same-store sales growth of 25%.  We have been able to step up new unit development this year and we are encouraged by the initial returns we are getting on our new company-owned stores.  ", "In the continent of Africa, we are also expanding aggressively.  We are building off an established base of about 700 stores in South Africa, where we are the clear market leader.  Africa is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and with over 1 billion people throughout the continent, it represents a tremendous long term growth opportunity.  ", "We completed the acquisition of our Turkey business earlier this month.  Turkey is a fast-developing country of about 75 million people.  With only about 60 KFC and 45 Pizza Hut restaurants, there\u2019s no question that we have a huge potential for growth there.  We\u2019ve already ramped up development and expect to open about 25 new restaurants this year. ", "Our acquisitions in these three countries advance our strategy to increase ownership in high-growth, high-return businesses.  I want to emphasize that we believe our company ownership is helping to accelerate growth.  In 2010, we had a total of 63 new units in these three countries combined.  This year, we expect to add over 170 units, and about 50 of those will be company-owned.", "It is likely that the new unit builds in these countries will continue to grow.  The combination of aggressive franchise growth and an equity presence in select countries should help us extend our lead in emerging markets.  We are generating strong growth, and believe we can do so for a long, long time.  ", "As a reminder, Yum! currently has around 2 restaurants per million people in the world\u2019s 10 largest emerging markets.  Assuming we maintain our current pace of development, we\u2019d have only about 4 restaurants per million people in these markets by the year 2020.  That compares to 58 restaurants per million in the U.S. today.", "Overall, Yum! Restaurants International business is on track for another solid year in 2013.  Clearly, we have a long runway for growth at YRI.  Now on to our U.S. business.", "Before I get into the U.S. business performance, it is interesting to note that the U.S. business has a royalty stream in excess of $800 million.  Therefore, when you put YRI and the U.S. together, they\u2019ll produce about $1.8 billion of franchise revenue in 2013.  That\u2019s almost double what we produced as a company 10 years ago.", "While our U.S. business is beginning to development net new units, it is more reliant on growing same-store sales for its growth.  In our category, you grow same-store sales by offering strong value and introducing innovative new products.  ", "In the past year, I don\u2019t think anyone has done a better job of innovation than Taco Bell.  Taco Bell grew same-store sales by 6% in the quarter, and that\u2019s on top of 6% growth in the first quarter last year.  ", "We\u2019re now in the midst of launching Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos.  Our new marketing campaign, Live Mas, is resonating well with consumers, and the brand is generating lots of excitement in social media.  We expect to sell about 100 million Doritos Locos Tacos during the second quarter, and this continues to be one of the most successful new product launches in our history.  ", "As we look at the balance of the year, we believe that we have strong product offerings.  Because these are backed by solid operations and increased media rates, we believe that Taco Bell is well-positioned to have another successful year in 2013.", "Pizza Hut and KFC sales in the U.S. during the first quarter were softer than we would have liked.  In this environment, you win by providing compelling value and innovation.  In hindsight, some of our competitors did a better job of this than we did.  We expect to fare better for the balance of the year, and we are particularly excited about the recent launch of KFC\u2019s original recipe boneless chicken.", "We are continuing to add net new units at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  The Pizza Hut Delco Lite format is generating excitement among our franchisees and is allowing us to add more units in small town America.  ", "Taco Bell is following Pizza Hut\u2019s lead, and is also going after more rural new units.  Taco Bell is again adding net units in 2013, and the combination of a new, smaller building asset design and a franchisee rural incentive should lead us to even more net unit growth and openings in 2014.  When we look at the U.S. we are building the foundation for a business that we believe will provide better and more consistent performance.  ", "To sum it up, while China is clearly experiencing a challenging year, the rest of Yum! is performing pretty well.  We believe we are well-positioned for the future, and these divisions are on track to achieve our full year growth targets for 2013.", "Now let me hand things over to our CFO, Patrick Grismer.", "Patrick Grismer ", "Thank you, Rick.  As you heard from David and Rick, Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S. division are delivering solid results, yet we obviously have our challenges in China.  We continue to see this as a temporary setback, and remain as bullish as ever on our long term growth prospects.", "As evidence of that, we are continuing to invest in the future.  With these investments, and given the demonstrated growth potential of our businesses, I\u2019m very confident that our track record of double digit EPS growth will be restored in the years to come.", "I\u2019ll now provide some additional perspective on our first quarter results and share our EPS outlook for the second quarter and full year.  For the first quarter, we recorded an 8% decline in EPS before special items, which was significantly better than the 25% decline that we had previously estimated.  This better than expected result was primarily driven by stronger than expected sales in China during the Chinese New Year holiday period in February.", "Now I\u2019ll share some performance highlights for each major division.  In China, operating profit declined 41% in the first quarter, prior to foreign currency translation, driven by a 20% drop in same-store sales.  With a sales decline of this magnitude, China restaurant margin was severely impacted, down 7 percentage points versus prior year.  Bear in mind, this dynamic works in both directions, so as our China sales recover, we expect a similar rebound in restaurant margin.", "On the development front, China had an exceptional quarter, opening 226 new restaurants, or nearly 4 per day.  With Chinese New Year following relatively late in the quarter this year, our world-class China development team was very intentional about pulling units forward into the first quarter to benefit from peak seasonal sales.", "Yum! Restaurants International reported operating profit growth of 19% in the first quarter, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation.  We benefited from a major franchise ownership change this quarter, which added transfer and renewal fees, as well as from changes to an overseas pension plan.   ", "These items added 8 percentage points of operating profit growth to YRI\u2019s overall performance.  And, as expected, refranchising the Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business late last year benefited YRI\u2019s operating profit growth by another 3 percentage points.", "Adjusting for these items, YRI\u2019s core business delivered about 8% operating profit growth this quarter.  Importantly, YRI continued to drive impressive unit growth, opening 147 new restaurants in the quarter, including 103 new units in emerging markets.  Same-store sales grew 1%, which was softer than expected, as weak results in Japan and Western Europe adversely impacted YRI\u2019s same-store sales by about 2 percentage points.  ", "However, we experienced strong same-store sales growth in our equity-led emerging market businesses in Russia, South Africa, and Thailand, and we\u2019re pleased with the sustained improvement of our KFC Australia business.  Restaurant margin increased 1.4 percentage points at YRI, largely due to the refranchising of or Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business.", "Moving to the U.S., first quarter operating profit grew 5% versus prior year.  Excluding the impact of refranchising, operating profit grew a very respectable 7%.  This performance was led by Taco Bell, which had an outstanding quarter with 6% same-store sales growth and restaurant margin improvement of 2.4 percentage points.", "It\u2019s clear that our customers love both nacho cheese and now Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos.  And without a doubt, Taco Bell is a leading performer in the category.  In fact, this marks the fourth consecutive quarter that Taco Bell has outperformed the category, demonstrating the positive momentum we have as a powerful brand that represents about 60% of our U.S. profit.  And while sales at Pizza Hut and KFC fell below our expectations in Q1, their profits were more or less on plan.  ", "For the U.S. division overall, restaurant margin increased 2.4 percentage points in the first quarter, including 1.3 percentage points from refranchising.  Importantly, this marked the fifth consecutive quarter of year over year margin gains in the U.S.", "And finally, speaking of U.S. refranchising, we continue to make good progress with our program, which we expect will be substantially completed by the end of this year, bringing our franchise ownership in the U.S. to over 90%.  This ownership strategy, along with our improved unit-level economics, positions the U.S. for more consistent profit growth in the years ahead.", "Now I\u2019ll turn to EPS expectations for the second quarter and full year.  As you know, the most sensitive variable in this year\u2019s profit forecast is China same-store sales, so I\u2019ll start with that.  As disclosed in our 8-K filing on April 10, March same-store sales declined 13% in our China business, with KFC same-store sales declining 16% and Pizza Hut casual dining same-store sales growing 4%.", "As David mentioned, we continue to expect the sales recovery will take time.  However, the recent publicity on avian flu will add even more choppiness to that recovery, weighing particularly heavily on second quarter results.  ", "Based on our results through the first three weeks of April, we expect China division same-store sales to decline about 30% for the month, with KFC significantly negative and Pizza Hut casual dining positive.  Prior instances of avian flu have been short lived at KFC, and with this as our assumption, we believe our overall recovery will be no different from our previous estimate, with China division same-store sales turning positive during the fourth quarter.  We will continue to temporarily provide monthly updates on same-store sales in China, and we\u2019ll report April sales on May 10, 2013, after market hours.  ", "Despite the start of our recovery from the China poultry supply situations that occurred in late December, and with the unexpected impact of avian flu publicity that started in April, we are forecasting a significant double digit EPS decline for Yum! in Q2 and expect this to be the low point of our year by far.", "As for the full year, our EPS expectations are essentially unchanged at this stage.  We are holding our full year forecast at a mid single digit decline because of the risk of avian flu publicity added to our China sales recovery.  Essentially, we are estimating that all of the EPS upside we saw in the first quarter versus our earlier estimate will be offset in the second quarter due to the impact of avian flu.", "That said, I want to emphasize that it is extremely difficult to forecast sales or profits in China right now.  This was already a challenging proposition, and the recent emergence of avian flu has only added to the uncertainty.", "Despite our short term setback in KFC China, our long term growth model is still intact, driven by new unit development, same-store sales growth, and high returns on investment.  The good thing about our business is we are a cash generating machine.  Even with this year\u2019s disappointing EPS results, we expect free cash flow well over $2 billion, which includes a franchise royalty stream of nearly $2 billion.  ", "We also remain committed to using our operating cash flow to invest behind the growth we see in our business, with over $1 billion of capital expectations expected this year, while returning all remaining cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Our investment in new unit development is skewed towards high growth emerging markets such as China, India, Russia, and Africa, and these development opportunities remain very robust.  We continue to believe that China is the number-one retail growth opportunity in the world, and continue to forecast at least 700 new units there this year.", "Given the pace of development we achieved in the first quarter, we expect our new units in China to be more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year, and we expect this intense pace to ease balance of year.", "As always, we approach our China development with extreme rigor, and will continue to monitor new unit performance and adjust our expansion plans as appropriate.  We also expect to open at least 150 new units in India this year, with over half of these being KFCs, thereby growing our KFC store base by over 30% versus prior year.", "At YRI, we expect to build over 950 units, including 80 units in Africa, 60 units in Russia, and 50 units in Thailand.  And finally, driven by the irresistible returns of our Pizza Hut Delco Lite and the improved economics of our Taco Bell units, we expect the U.S. will be net unit positive again in 2013.", "In summary, 2013 is shaping up to be a very challenging year for Yum!, and while we take account of these results, we view this year as an aberration that neither erases our track record of performance nor diminishes the growth opportunity that we are uniquely well-positioned to capture.  I\u2019m confident that we will bounce back strongly and regain our status as a double digit growth company in the years ahead.", "And now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.

I think historically you said the avian flu has been very short in its impact.  Just want to sort of get a sense of if you look back at \u201905, are we talking about a month, or two months?  Or kind of what the overall cadence is?  ", "And then also, on the same, related topic, it looks like you managed margins very, very well in China, so maybe can you just talk a little bit about what kind of variable expenses are there in payroll and occupancy that allowed you to hold margins that well given the negative costs in the quarter?  ", "Patrick Grismer ", "With respect to to the impact of avian flu, when we look back at how this has impacted our business in the past, what we have seen is a sharp impact initially that then diminishes over a period of about three months.  So we\u2019re expecting about the same recovery period this year.  And so just to reinforce then, in terms of our overall sales recovery, what we are currently estimating is a 6-9 month recovery period, with same-store sales in China turning positive in the fourth quarter.", "And then with respect to your question on margin, there were obviously a number of moving pieces here.  The most significant variable in that equation is transactions.  And so the transactions did hit us significantly in the first quarter, and as that reverses, it will certainly work to our advantage over the course of the rest of the year.", "With respect to the composition of our restaurant costs and the variable components, there is a fair amount of variability in rent expense where many of our units have a variable rent component, as well as the fact that a portion of our labor expense is variable.  And also, keep in mind that advertising, which runs about 4% of sales, is also nearly entirely variable.  And so that gives us some ability to mitigate the impact of the transaction deleverage.

Firstly, obviously first quarter development was exceptional, especially for a two-month quarter, and I think David, for emphasis, a few times you said you expect 700 for the year.  So I guess at this point, trying to get a sense whether the avian flu and the December price [unintelligible], kind of having you back off the development maybe, at least as I\u2019m interpreting, maybe slightly, especially relative to prior years?  You know, if there are other issues that we should be sensitive to?", "And then the second question, if I may, is on gross margins in China, or cost of goods sold looked at inversely, that was very, very low.  The COGS was very low in the quarter, and some may have interpreted that you would invest in gross margins to kind of really sell the value message to consumers, whether now or at some point in the future.  So just wanted to get a sense of how you may use the COGS line or gross margins to invest to get back traffic when the time is right.", "David Novak  ", "Well, I think, first of all, on the development, we think that staying the course on the number that we provided at the analyst conference back in December was that we said we\u2019d open at least 700 units.  We still think that\u2019s the right number.", "I think the reason why we believe it\u2019s the right number and we\u2019re staying on it is that we\u2019re still out developing competition by a wide margin, as I said, we still have that first mover advantage that we\u2019re opening up in 100 new cities this year.  So we don\u2019t really see any urgency to expand more rapidly in this current environment.", "I think the China team has always been given the charge that this is a business that\u2019s a jewel.  Polish that jewel, keep making it as strong as you can.  And we\u2019ve never ever forced or challenged the team to grow at a faster rate than it ought to, and I think as we look at the year, and where we\u2019re at, we just think that we\u2019re going to make the prudent and the right decisions as we go forward.  And that number will be at least 700 restaurants, so that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re looking at that.", "In terms of investment in the value proposition, we have great cost structure.  We\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for the customer.  We have a number of value initiatives planned, even with this current challenging environment.

And that\u2019s our goal.  ", "This is obviously a challenging time, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you just can\u2019t keep investing and building the brand and setting yourself up for the future.  And we love our positioning with KFC in China over the long term.

So a rollover pricing benefit, if you will, of 3 points.

The wage rate component of that was up 8%.

And then as you continue to grow, is the poultry industry capable of growing with you?", "Richard Carucci ", "At present, we don\u2019t expect the increased rigor of supply chain management practices is going to have a material effect on our poultry supply costs.  In fact, we have reason to believe that flock yields could improve as a result of some of these more stringent practices and that will help to diminish the cost of any new procedures that may be put in place at our suppliers to continue to drive even higher levels of quality.

And what I\u2019m seeing is that chicken production in China is more fragmented.  It\u2019s not vertically integrated like it is in the U.S.  So on that first point, is there an opportunity to help suppliers vertically integrate in China so you don\u2019t see uncertainty.  Maybe it\u2019s using a multinational company, for example, as a key supplier.  Where do you stand on that?  ", "And secondly is response to rumors.  It seems like you\u2019ve been caught off guard a few times in terms of rumors, and social media has exacerbated this.  Has there been a seismic shift, or has there been a change in the way you\u2019re choosing to respond to rumors more quickly or more effectively?", "David Novak ", "First of all, what I think we\u2019ve done on the supply chain is we\u2019ve taken swift, decisive action to work with our suppliers to get an even more enhanced supply chain system.  As I talked about earlier, we\u2019ve eliminated over a thousand chicken houses from our supply chain.  To your point, we are working with our suppliers to support the integrated farming system, developing best practices, working with them very closely.

Is there something you\u2019re seeing specifically that gives you confidence?  Or is it just relying on the historical analogues?", "Richard Carucci ", "I would say the fact that we have seen sales start to come back in February and March, as David had said, about where we expected, gives us confidence that this recovery period of six to nine months is a reasonable expectation.  Before the recent publicity of avian flu, we were seeing the recovery, and we continue to expect, therefore, that a full recovery will happen in that six to nine month period, particularly given the fact that we expect this dramatic impact of avian flu will persist for only about three months or so.

I think one of the things that we are tracking is as we build awareness of everything that we\u2019re doing with Operation Thunder is just improving consumer perceptions and the answer is the more people are aware of what we\u2019re doing, the better they feel about coming back into our business.

It\u2019s subsided a little bit, but not a lot.

We\u2019ve added in the Little Sheep concept, which has slightly lower margins.  Is this still the right long term target?  Is that what you\u2019re planning for?  Is this something that a return to positive comps can help you achieve?  Or is this now a multiyear process to get back to that target given the acute challenges of this year?", "Richard Carucci ", "We continue to believe that 20% margins are imminently achievable with our China business, and it\u2019s not just comps that are going to get us there.  Certainly in the short term, the transaction recovery is going to be the single biggest driver of margin improvement.  No doubt about it.  However, there are a couple of other things to keep in mind.  ", "The first is ongoing asset leverage as we continue to add new layers to our business, to our existing restaurants.  Whether it\u2019s 24-hour operations in our KFC business or breakfast at Pizza Hut, these new sales layers are going to better leverage the existing investment we have and provide that leverage on fixed cost.  ", "And then the other is the impact of portfolio shift.  As I mentioned, when we look at our new unit development program going forward, for the KFC brand we are continuing to shift from the tier one and tier two coastal cities to the tier two inland and tier three and below cities, where margins are significantly higher and we are continuing to shift more of our new unit program from KFC to Pizza Hut.

This is going to be an increasing focus of our development program going forward, and that\u2019s going to benefit the portfolio restaurant margin for our China business.

I know you don\u2019t want to give any guidance at this point, or specific guidance at this point, but I was just wondering if you think 2014 could be a big rebound year in terms of the earnings growth given the expected sales recovery in China?  So for example, soft year in 2013, followed by a well above average year in \u201914?  And by the time you get to 2015 maybe you\u2019re back on your long run trend line?  Just any thoughts on how you think it might play out would be helpful.", "Richard Carucci ", "I think you\u2019re thinking about it exactly the right way.  Let me tell you, if 2014 is not a big bounce back year, we will all be very disappointed, because that is our expectation.  We have a high degree of confidence that is going to be the case.  And as I said in my remarks earlier, 2013 is an aberration.  ", "So I wouldn\u2019t spend too much time focusing on 2013 results.  Not to suggest that we\u2019re not focused on doing the best job possible, but as it relates to how you think about our business, and what we\u2019re going to deliver, and how we\u2019re set up to continue to grow, I encourage you to continue to focus on 2014.  We do expect that we will begin to see a strong recovery next year.", "David Novak ", "Our great and late chairman Andy Pearson had a great line.  He said the best way to have a great year is to follow up a bad one.  Well, we clearly have a bad one this year, and so we expect next year to be very, very good, and we have very high expectations for ourselves.  I think the important thing for our investors to know is that we\u2019re building the platforms that we think will establish the long term growth.  ", "If you take Taco Bell for example, we are really leading in terms of improving our quality, innovation with what we\u2019ve done with Frito Lay and the Doritos Locos Tacos line.  We have world class operations.  We\u2019ve been focusing on that for some time, but we\u2019re ranked in the top three across every key measure in operations that we look at.  We\u2019re building it for the long term.", "At Pizza Hut, we\u2019ve got good value proposition, good innovation.  We\u2019re working on a major platform in chicken, where we can really develop our sales as we go forward.  Across the board, we\u2019re working on the sales layers, the breakfasts and beverages and things that we think will give us the incremental sales that will be significant over the long term.  ", "So what we\u2019re focused on this year is staying the course and building a sustainable growth engine for the long term.  And nobody expects us to grow at least 10% next year.  We expect to do a lot better.  ", "Patrick Grismer ", "And the other important point to reiterate, David mentioned this in his remarks earlier, is the impact of the new unit development in China.  So last year we opened about 900.  This year we\u2019re saying at least 700, so that\u2019s 1,600 between the two years combined.  Collectively, that will deliver about $2 billion of system sales, which represents about a 25% increase on the base.  ", "So think about it.  As we recover from the effects of this late December incident and the more recent avian flu publicity, we have all these new assets on the ground generating sales and profits that will contribute significantly to our growth in 2014.", "David Novak ", "But the proof\u2019s in the pudding, you know?  I mean, you can look at this and you can see all kinds of potential, but as my father used to tell me, potential means you haven\u2019t done it yet.  So we\u2019ve got to turn around China, we\u2019ve got to keep building these businesses, and then I think the businesses will end up being where they ought to be.  And this is a growth company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies.   ", "Andy Barish - Jefferies", "Two quick YRI questions.  On the avian flu, do you expect a little bit of impact in some of your other Asian markets?  And then just a clarification on the Pizza Hut U.K. franchise renewals.  The deal closed in the fourth quarter, but the renewal fees and new franchise stuff came in in the first quarter?", "Patrick Grismer ", "I\u2019ll respond to that piece first.  The franchise ownership transfer, with the transfer fees and the renewal, wasn\u2019t related to the Pizza Hut U.K. business.  It related to a different market for us, where there was a transfer in ownership from one franchisee to another.  That happened in YRI\u2019s first quarter.", "Richard Carucci ", "Regarding impact of avian flu, I don\u2019t think what\u2019s happened in China is going to impact other markets.  I think what will happen is if that appears in those markets.  We\u2019re obviously going to keep a close eye on that.  We\u2019re prepared in advance to communicate what our response would be, which is what people have said here before, which is properly cooked chicken is perfectly safe to eat.  So we\u2019re ready for the possibility, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have an impact unless it hits other countries.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.  ", "Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research", "I\u2019ll try to avoid the China questions.  It seems like we\u2019ve gotten a lot of different angles on that.  Although I\u2019m sure there\u2019s probably some more.  But just on the balance sheet, there wasn\u2019t a lot of share repurchase in the quarter.  And you are, I think, under 1x levered.  Could you maybe just discuss if there are any constraints to using the balance sheet a little more aggressively in general, and using share repurchase in particular?", "Patrick Grismer ", "We continue to take a look at this, and we\u2019re quite happy with where things are at right now.  We\u2019re generating enough cash to pay the meaningful dividend and return remaining cash to share repurchases at a level that will accomplish what we expect as it relates to contribution to earnings per share growth.  We\u2019re not interested in leveraging up at this stage and putting at risk our investment grade credit rating.  We believe we\u2019re in the sweet spot as it relates to how we balance these things out and the implications for our overall cost of capital.  So no plans to do what you\u2019ve suggested.", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ", "And separately, just on the second quarter, I think you mentioned down double digit.  Obviously that\u2019s a wide range.  Maybe any more particular range, obviously that could be down 10% or down 30%.  Any incremental info on how to model the second quarter would be helpful.", "And does the very weak second quarter results on tap, obviously it\u2019s China driven, but does some of it relate to the very typical comparison at Taco Bell?", "Patrick Grismer ", "No.  Certainly Taco Bell was not playing into how we\u2019ve characterized EPS results in Q2.  What we\u2019ve said is that it will be a significant double digit decline.  By far our low point of the year.  But because we delivered so much better results in the first quarter, that puts us in a position to cover the unexpected severe impact of avian flu on second quarter results and thus hold to our full year estimate of mid single digit down.  ", "And just given that the wildcard here is China sales recovery, which is very difficult to call, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to give a more precise estimate of what that second quarter will be.  But we want everyone to know that it will be a significant double digit decline.  ", "Richard Carucci ", "And regarding the overlap of Taco Bell from a sales perspective, it is a huge overlap, as you point out.  As I said on my speech, we grew 6% in the first quarter on top of 6% last year.  And the second quarter Taco Bell last year had 13% same-store sales growth, which is obviously a huge number.  We look at it as anything positive being a really good result there.  And what the team has put in place, in the launch of Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos, I think we have a decent chance of accomplishing that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West of Deutsche Bank.  ", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "", "Just a bigger picture question on China.  We have seen a bit of a continued deceleration in GDP growth and retail sales growth in that market.  I was just wondering how that plays into your longer term thinking on unit growth.  And does it really matter if GDP is up 7 or 10, or do you have just so much room in the smaller cities that it really doesn\u2019t play into your growth algorithm at all?", "David Novak ", "We see the biggest macro is the growing consumer class, growing from 300 million to 600 million.  So let\u2019s say it grows from 300 to 550 or 300 to 500, it\u2019s still a lot.  And we\u2019ve got lots of upside as we go forward.  So that\u2019s the big macro that we look at, the growing consumer class and growing disposable income.  We think both those things will be moving in our direction and that\u2019s the key.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Omohundro with Davenport and Company.  ", " ", "Jeff Omohundro - Davenport and Company", "Just wanted to expand a little bit on the Taco Bell momentum that you referenced.  I was just wondering if you could maybe address the Cool Ranch DLT launch with regard to mix shift and just how it compared with the original DLT launch.  Again, particularly since you\u2019re overlapping such challenging prior year comparisons.  ", "Richard Carucci ", "When Doritos Locos Tacos was launched in 2012, with nacho cheese, the peak mix was about 11-12%.  And when it was [off air] sort of towards the end of the year, beginning of this year, it got down to about 4%.  So we left it on the menu, but we weren\u2019t promoting it for a period of time.  When we relaunched Cool Ranch, we got about that same level of mix, about 11-12% of mix.", "David Novak ", "That\u2019s a huge number for Taco Bell.  Anything over 3% is big.  If you haven\u2019t tried it yet, you ought to.  If you like Doritos, you can\u2019t eat just one.  Try the boneless chicken at KFC too while you\u2019re at it.  That\u2019s really good.  Then if you need another meal, go have cheesy crust pizza.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.  ", " ", "Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays", "Two follow up questions.  One on China.  I know you talked about the complete confidence and the full sales recovery.  Obviously some of these issues have been compounded, which makes teasing it out somewhat difficult.  I think most people agree that the supplier issue and the avian flu issue will ease with time, and you have history for that.  ", "But any thoughts on, I know we had seen a slowdown in trend in October, November, December, which was talked about at your analyst day.  I know it was tough to kind of look at it.  At that point in time, there was some debate whether average check had gotten too high, or whether there was too much price.  ", "I\u2019m just wondering how you think about what gives you the confidence in the full sales recovery, or what would you see that would make you more cautious that maybe the initial issue back in the fourth quarter of \u201912 might be more severe than you might have thought.  And I had a follow up.  ", "David Novak ", "I think we know that we\u2019re constantly improving our value equation, constantly building awareness of the sales layers we have, with delivery and 24-hour service, and breakfast.  So we\u2019ve got things that we\u2019ve invested in to give us a base that we can build on.  And we think it\u2019s early days.  ", "I mean, we\u2019re not capacity constrained.  It\u2019s not like we can\u2019t make more chicken, sell more products, and build our day parts.  Our average unit volumes are $1.7 million to $1.8 million at KFC and Pizza Hut.  The average unit volumes for McDonald\u2019s is $2.6 million in the United States.  So we think that one of the ways McDonald\u2019s got there is they kept building those incremental day parts over time.  ", "And that\u2019s what we think we clearly have the opportunity, as we move ahead.  And I think that\u2019s just fundamentally, when you look at our asset base, and how we can leverage it, that gives us a lot of confidence.  These are very untapped day parts that we\u2019re just in the early days on.  So I think that\u2019s the biggest opportunity.", "Patrick Grismer ", "The other thing that\u2019s going to help is if you look at the quarters balance of year, the last are the less challenging, if you will, and certainly that\u2019s going to contribute to our ability to deliver improving results balance of year on the underlying business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.  ", "Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo", "Just again staying away from the China discussion, just looking for a little additional color.  I think you said 240 basis points increase in the U.S. restaurant margin.  Looks like you called out Taco Bell sales leverage and some refranchising as drivers.  But what was the approximate margin benefit from each of those things?  And I guess more importantly, as you look out to 2013 full year U.S. margin, what type of guidance can you give us for that?", "Patrick Grismer ", "What we saw in Q1 we expect to be about what we\u2019ll see for the full year.  The impact of refranchising was about half of the margin improvement we saw in the U.S. in the first quarter.", "Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo ", "And that carries through to all four quarters?", "Patrick Grismer ", "There will be some variability from quarter to quarter, but on a full year basis we expect to see about 17% margin for the U.S.", "Steve Schmitt", "I think that\u2019s our last question for the day.

Brands second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions.] Thank you, Mr. Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Novak, Chairman and CEO; Rick Carucci, President; and Pat Grismer, our CFO.", "Before we get started, I would also like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.", "In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands\u2019 website, www.yum.com, to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call.", "We are broadcasting the conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded, and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in the future use of the recording.", "Finally, we would like you to be aware of the following Yum! investor events occurring in the next three months. Our Yum! Restaurants International investor and analyst conference will be on August 21, in Plano, Texas. Our Yum! China investor and analyst conference will be on September 9 and 10 in Shanghai, China. And our third quarter earnings release will be Tuesday, October 8.", "I would now like to turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak ", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. The second quarter was extremely challenging for Yum! Brands, but sales and profits were generally in line with what we had previously communicated. Earnings per share, excluding special items, declined 16% versus prior year, as our China division operating profit fell 63% prior to foreign currency translation. Operating profit increased 12% at Yum! Restaurants International, and 4% in our U.S. business.", "Now, there\u2019s obviously been a lot going on with our KFC business in China, so let me give you an update on our progress. Beginning in April, KFC sales in China were significantly impacted by the intense media surrounding avian flu. The quarter was also impacted by the residual effect of the poultry supply incident, which occurred in late December.", "Fortunately, the extensive media surrounding avian flu in China has subsided, and same-store sales at KFC are on the road to recovery. In fact, our KFC same-store sales decline in June was 13% versus the 26% decline we just reported for the second quarter. This is clearly another improvement in our trend, and further evidence the brand is continuing to recover from both avian flu and the poultry supply incident.", "I was just recently with our China team and I can assure you they are weathering the adversity and executing with a great sense of urgency. So even though we believe the gift of time will be the most important contributor to our ongoing KFC sales recovery, the team remains extremely focused and are taking the necessary steps to get sales back on track as soon as possible.", "For example, we launched a quality assurance advertising campaign in mid-April reminding consumers of our commitment to quality in China and that properly cooked chicken is perfectly safe to eat. Our quality assurance message speaks directly to young families, encouraging them to come back to KFC because of the care we take and the safety of our supply chain.", "In addition, we recently launched a new value initiative centered on wings, a customer favorite, and we have significant news coming on the chicken front. We\u2019re also advertising protein alternatives that are available at KFC such as our shrimp and mushroom rolls.", "Looking ahead, we believe we will have solid marketing and product news coming later this year. We\u2019re hopeful these initiatives will contribute to our overall sales recovery and help build additional momentum balance of the year. We are confident KFC remains a power brand with a great future.", "Speaking of power brands in China, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the very strong performance of Pizza Hut casual dining, which delivered solid same-store sales growth in the quarter, up 7% on top of 10% in the second quarter of last year.", "Pizza Hut continues to lead with innovation and everyday affordable value. We just launched a major new product with Stone Pan Sizzling Steak that we know our customers will love. We\u2019re also continuing to leverage our assets by expanding our breakfast menu into more and more cities.", "Pizza Hut casual dining is unquestionably the leading Western casual dining concept in China, with over 900 units in 228 cities. Importantly, we continue to have less than three year cash paybacks on new units and the business is on track to deliver another strong year in 2013.", "With the terrific performance we are seeing, we continue to broaden our new unit development at Pizza Hut and are aggressively expanding into lower-tier cities. We are very bullish on Pizza Hut casual dining. With both KFC and now Pizza Hut, we are in the early stages of our growth, with a long runway ahead.", "In addition, we continue to invest behind the development of our emerging brands. Pizza Hut home service, which is in the home delivery category, now has 171 units in 21 cities. We now have strong unit economics and will ultimately scale Pizza Hut delivery service across the country, which is obviously more good news for the powerful Pizza Hut brand in China.", "We\u2019re also making slow but steady progress with East Dawning, our Chinese fast food concept, but still have much work to do to develop a scalable business model. With respect to Little Sheep, as I had mentioned on prior calls, the results have been soft due in part to the long approval process and transition of the acquisition.", "We\u2019ve been working hard to reconcept the brand to accelerate long term growth. However, we are now facing the brunt of negative publicity resulting from quality issues at other competitive hot pot concepts in China. This has resulted in a huge cloud over the hot pot category. As the category leader, Little Sheep sales have been significantly impacted, even though there never was an issue with Little Sheep quality.", "We believe we will weather this issue over time. Nevertheless, our path to new unit expansion is taking longer than we envisioned. But we will continue to invest in the brand. Our goal remains to aggressively expand over the longer term.", "So let me wrap up our China business. Even with our recent challenges in China, we are focused on the long term, and we\u2019re as bullish as ever about our growth prospects. We like how we\u2019re positioned in a country with over 1 billion people, and even though the economy is slowing, it\u2019s still the world\u2019s fastest growing economy, and is expected to grow about 7% this year.", "The macro trend we continue to be most enthusiastic about is the growing consumer class, which is estimated to be about 300 million people today and growing to over 600 million by 2020, and disposable incomes are growing right alongside it. In 2013, our new unit development target of at least 700 new stores remains unchanged. This means we will have opened about 1,600 new units in a two-year period and the sales continue to recover at KFC. Our goal is to have substantial momentum heading into 2014.", "Outside of China, we continue to expect on target performance for Yum! Brands, and we are well-positioned to deliver against our operating profit targets for the year. At Yum! Restaurants International, the business continues to have a solid year, led primarily by high-growth emerging markets such as South Africa, Russia, and Thailand.", "And even though we\u2019re being affected by a moderating global economy, new unit development remains extremely robust. In fact, we recently met with over 400 of our franchise partners representing 100 countries at our biannual franchise convention, which was held this year in Beijing.", "As evidence of our franchisees\u2019 enthusiasm for our brands, we expect to open at least 1,000 new units at YRI this year, about 900 of which will be developed by franchisees. Our franchisees\u2019 spirits are extremely high, and it is clear they remain committed to long term growth.", "In the United States, our overall same-store sales were positive, and we continue to be particularly pleased with Taco Bell. Taco Bell continues to have momentum and the franchise community is clearly excited about the future growth strategies of the brand.", "I recently met with Franmac, the Taco Bell franchise leadership committee, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going too far when I say they are extremely enthusiastic about our Live Mas advertising campaign as well as our innovative new product platforms, Doritos Locos Tacos, and Cantina Bell.", "They also told me they are optimistic about our national breakfast launch in 2014. It\u2019s great to have such a progressive group of leaders at Taco Bell. They know we\u2019re building the brand the right way for the long term, see the importance of leveraging our assets throughout the day, and are committed to operational excellence.", "I\u2019m also pleased that 2013 will mark the second consecutive year of net new unit growth in our U.S. divisions, led by new unit development at Pizza Hut, which will open about 125 net new units and Taco Bell, which will open around 80 net new units.", "In India, it\u2019s full speed ahead with new unit development as we expect to open 150 new units this year and double our restaurant count by 2015 to around 1,000 units. We have recently launched major value initiatives for each of our brands that are driving sales and further improving our business model.", "So to wrap it all up, the China recovery is progressing as expected, and YRI, India, and the U.S. are basically on target with our expectations. We expect 2014 will be a strong bounce back year, so in 2013, we will continue to invest in our core business, continue to pay a meaningful dividend, and continue to repurchase shares.", "Now let me hand it over to Rick Carucci who will take you through our strategies for Yum! Restaurants International and our U.S. business.", "Rick Carucci ", "Thank you, David. Good morning. Today, in addition to talking about our results at Yum! Restaurants International in the U.S., I will also describe the diversity of our franchise business at YRI. I will then show how portfolio actions and new unit development are improving results, margins, and our growth proposition in the U.S.", "At Yum! Restaurants International, our strategy is to drive aggressive international expansion and build strong brands everywhere. On our last earnings call, I mentioned that the YRI franchise revenue stream is large, growing, global, and diversified.", "In the 10-year period from 2002 to 2012, our franchise units almost doubled, from 7,000 to 13,000. YRI\u2019s franchisees have tripled over the same timeframe, from almost $300 million to about $900 million. This year, franchise fees will reach nearly $1 billion. So clearly, this revenue stream is large and growing.", "Let me now spend a minute talking about how diversified this global portfolio is. Let\u2019s first look at the regional balance. We have a large and growing presence in Asia, which accounts for 28% of our franchise fees. The Americas account for 22% of our fees. Europe also accounts for 22% of YRI fees. To round out the world, 16% of our franchise fees come from the Middle East and Africa, and 12% from Australia and New Zealand.", "In addition to having strong regional balance, our franchise fees reflect our dominant presence in high-growth emerging markets. Emerging markets currently account for about 45% of our revenue stream, but make up a higher percentage of our growth. As an example, in our most recent quarter, 63% of our new units were opened in emerging markets.", "We also continue to enter new emerging markets. In the past 12 months alone, KFC has entered Argentina, the Ukraine, Malawi, Angola, and just last month, we opened the first Western concept to enter Outer Mongolia. You really know you have a global concept when you can proudly open up restaurants in Outer Mongolia.", "When you put it all together, YRI\u2019s fees are generated from over 100 countries. Furthermore, no single country at YRI represents more than 10% of our franchise revenue stream. This level of diversification is second to none. We believe this large, growing, global, and diversified income stream is extremely valuable to our shareholders.", "Now, at YRI we typically use the franchise model. We have also said that we will develop a company-owned presence in select high growth countries that meet our ownership criteria. These include the ability to build scale, establish a leadership position, and generate strong returns.", "Last quarter I talked a bit about growth markets where we recently acquired equity: Russia, South Africa, and Turkey. Today, I\u2019ll highlight Thailand, an emerging market where we have had company ownership for quite some time.", "Excluding China and the U.S., we have more company-owned restaurants in Thailand than anywhere else in the world. We have 544 total units, 360 of which are company-owned. Thailand is clearly a strong performer and growth driver for YRI.", "Since 2009, system sales have almost doubled, operating profit has tripled, and restaurant margins have increased from 14% to almost 20% today. We have clear brand leadership in Thailand. In fact, we have 473 KFCs, compared to 184 units for McDonalds. We plan on extending our lead with plans to build at least 40 additional units this year. We also have 71 Pizza Huts.", "Given our powerful brand positions and attractive unit economics, we\u2019re confident Thailand will continue to provide meaningful growth for years to come. Overall, we\u2019re extremely excited about our YRI growth opportunities and our new unit development.", "In 2012, we opened a record 949 new units, and added 513 net new units. This year we expect another new record. As David mentioned, our new unit development target for 2013 is now at least 1,000 new units, including 600 net new units. This represents an increase from the 950 new units we were expecting coming into the year.", "This accelerated growth in net new unit count is significant for two reasons. First, 2013 will be the second consecutive year where we will generate 4% growth in YRI net new units. Second, this accelerating pace excludes India, which was a key growth driver for YRI before it was separated into its own division in 2012.", "And while development is a key driver of our growth, our ongoing growth model also calls for 2-3% growth in same-store sales. During the quarter, YRI delivered same-store sales growth of 1%, primarily due to weakness in Japan and the U.K.", "However, our emerging market business continues to see momentum, boasting 5% growth in same-store sales during the quarter. We\u2019re especially pleased with the progress in Russia and South Africa as they continue to grow same-store sales while also developing new units.", "YRI is on track to achieve its ongoing growth target of 10% profit growth as the upside in new unit development, combined with recent portfolio actions, are helping to offset the shortfall in same-store sales growth.", "Now, on to our U.S. business. Our U.S. strategy should dramatically improve our brand positions, consistency, and returns. There are three factors that are helping us achieve this: Our ownership structure, the strength of the Taco Bell business, and our development program.", "In terms of our franchise ownership, a decade ago 28% of our units were company-owned, while 72% were franchise. Through our franchising efforts, we are now 90% franchised. This should help deliver more consistency going forward since there is less profit volatility associated with a franchise business.", "One measure where you can see how portfolio actions have changed the nature of the business is operating margin. In 2009, our full year operating margin in the U.S. was 14.5%. For 2012, operating margin was 19.9%. Year to date, in 2013, our U.S. operating margin is 24%, up 4 points over prior year, and up 9.5% since 2009.", "As we have said before, our U.S. business has become more weighted towards Taco Bell performance. Taco Bell currently contributes about 50% of our U.S. operating profit, and our ownership structure reflects this. We now have 5% ownership of KFC and about 8% ownership of Pizza Hut. However, we are targeting our Taco Bell ownership at about 15%.", "While we are more dependent on Taco Bell the brand is currently performing. If you look at the entire U.S. QSR landscape, I think you could make the argument that Taco Bell has done the most in the last 18 to 24 months to improve its competitive position. The team has done a great job at product innovation, and at the same time the Live Mas brand positioning has really resonated with consumers.", "Taco Bell grew same-store sales by 2% in the quarter. This is on top of the 13% growth in the same quarter last year, which included the historic launch of Doritos Locos Tacos. We actually sold 100 million Doritos Locos Tacos during the second quarter of 2013, and it continues to be one of the most successful new product launches in our history. Our innovative use of social media contributed to the success of Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos, and is an overall strength of our brand.", "So all in all, we are quite pleased with Taco Bell. Our ongoing product innovation is backed by solid operations and increased media rates. We believe Taco Bell is well-positioned to complete a successful year in 2013.", "Now let me give you a brief update on KFC and Pizza Hut. In the second quarter, KFC delivered same-store sales growth of 3%, driven by the launch of KFC\u2019s original recipe boneless chicken. However, sales at Pizza Hut were weak. In this environment, you win by delivering a consistent and compelling value message, and our competitors have simply done a better job in this area so far this year.", "We\u2019ll have a more consistent value message going forward, and we continue to introduce new innovative products such as our flatbread pizza. We expect to deliver better sales growth at Pizza Hut during the balance of this year.", "And as David said, another piece of exciting news in the U.S. is that in 2013 we\u2019ll be at a net new unit growth position for the second year in a row. This is once again led by new unit development at both Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, as well as less contraction in KFC.", "The combination of more consistent growth in new unit development in the U.S., combined with accelerating new unit development at YRI, gives us great confidence in our long term growth model for each of these divisions.", "In fact, in 2009, our YRI and U.S. divisions opened over 1,100 units, including nearly 300 net new units. This year, we expect these divisions, plus India, to open about 1,500 new units, including over 800 net new units. This increase bodes well for our future.", "So to sum it all up, while China is clearly experiencing a challenging year, the rest of Yum! continues to hold up pretty well. Now let me hand things over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you, Rick. Our second quarter earnings per share were obviously very weak, due to the temporary sharp decline in our KFC business in China, but we expected these results as previously communicated.", "The important thing to focus on is that our KFC China business is clearly recovering, demonstrating solid improvement in same-store sales. Additionally, our other key businesses, including Pizza Hut in China, are delivering results that are generally in line with our growth targets.", "Over the next few minutes, I\u2019ll provide some additional perspective on our second quarter results, our EPS expectations for the full year, and our preliminary thoughts on 2014. For the second quarter, we recorded a 16% decline in EPS before special items, due to the significant challenges we faced in China, partially offset by growth in our YRI and U.S. divisions and a lower tax rate.", "In China, operating profit declined 63% in Q2, prior to foreign currency translation, driven by a 20% decline in same-store sales. This decline in same-store sales included a 26% decline at KFC and 7% growth at Pizza Hut casual dining.", "Similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, China restaurant margins decreased significantly in the second quarter, down 5 percentage points versus prior year, driven by the operating deleverage you\u2019d expect with a double digit decline in same-store sales.", "In addition, because Q2 is a seasonally low sales period in China, the deleverage impact on division operating profit, when viewed on a percentage basis, was even more pronounced due to the relatively fixed nature of G&A expenses. Bear in mind these P&L dynamics work in both directions, so as same-store sales rebound at KFC, we expect both margin and profit to benefit significantly from operating leverage.", "On the development front in China, we opened 100 new units during the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. While this was low in comparison to the first quarter, this resulted from a concerted effort by team China to pull new unit openings into Q1 to benefit from peak seasonal sales during Chinese New Year.", "For the first five months of the year, which comprised China\u2019s first and second quarters, we opened a total of 326 new units in China, which is more indicative of the run rate we expect balance of the year, and in line with our expectations of at least 700 new units in 2013. However, similar to previous years, new unit development in China will be heavily skewed to the fourth quarter.", "Yum! Restaurants International reported an operating profit growth of 12%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. The refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business late last year benefited YRI\u2019s operating profit growth by 3% percentage points. I\u2019m especially pleased with YRI\u2019s rapid pace of new unit development, especially considering that of the 205 new units that YRI opened in the quarter, about 63% were in high growth, emerging markets.", "Now as Rick mentioned, YRI\u2019s same-store sales grew 1% in the quarter. This was lower than expected, because similar to other retailers, we experienced soft performance in some developed markets. However, we\u2019re very pleased with the strong and broad-based growth we achieved in emerging markets. Restaurant margin increased 0.8 percentage points at YRI, largely due to the refranchising of our Pizza Hut U.K. dine-in business.", "In the U.S., second quarter operating profit grew 4% versus prior year. This included a benefit of about 10 percentage points from the overlap of expenses incurred in Q2 of last year, related to the resolution of an employment lawsuit. Partially offsetting this, refranchising negatively impacted U.S. operating profit growth by about 3 percentage points.", "Taco Bell again led the way in the U.S., delivering same-store sales growth of 2% in the quarter, successful overlapping last year\u2019s phenomenal 13%. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at Taco Bell, demonstrating yet again that our combination of breakthrough innovation, compelling value, and operational excellence resonates with consumers. As Taco Bell represents about 60% of U.S. division operating profit, we\u2019re especially pleased to see these same results.", "U.S. restaurant margin increased 0.8 percentage points, driven primarily by refranchising. As expected, our refranchising strategy is leading to more consistent results and is setting us up for even better returns in the years to come.", "We\u2019re also pleased with the progress we continue to make with our U.S. development strategy, where we again expect to achieve net positive unit growth for the second consecutive year, led by our attractive investment models for Pizza Hut Delco Lite and Taco Bell.", "Now I\u2019m going to talk about EPS expectations for the full year. To be clear, we\u2019re not changing our full year EPS estimate of a mid single digit percentage decline versus prior year. Additionally, consistent with our previous estimate, we expect that the 16% EPS decline in the second quarter will be our low point for the year.", "Our full year EPS forecast is obviously heavily dependent on our sales and margin recovery in China, and we\u2019ve estimated sales based on the actual trends we\u2019ve observed. You\u2019ll recall that through the end of March, we were making progress toward recovering from the poultry supply incident that occurred in late December, when in early April, we began to be impacted by publicity surrounding reported cases of avian flu.", "The negative impact of this publicity peaked in mid to late April. In early May, the number of newly reported avian flu cases began to fall off, and by the end of May, every province in China had lifted their emergency alerts related to avian flu. As a result, we began to see traffic rebound at KFC as reflected by the sequential improvements we reported in monthly KFC same-store sales since April, an 11 point improvement in May compared to April and a 12 point improvement in June compared to May.", "This pattern is generally consistent with what we\u2019ve observed with past instances of avian flu in China, roughly equating to a 3-month wear off period. Based on this trend, as well as the sustained improvement in our underlying business, we continue to expect that China sales will recover throughout the year and be positive in the fourth quarter.", "As we\u2019ve said before, the shape of these recoveries is difficult to predict, as no two issues are exactly the same. As previously committed, we will continue to keep you informed of our progress by temporarily providing monthly updates on our China same-store sales. Our next update will be for the month of July, which we will report on August 12, 2013, after market hours.", "Now as David mentioned, results of Little Sheep have been soft, due in part to a lower than expected approval process and ownership transition, and our new unit development progress has also been slower than we anticipated. Additionally, negative publicity resulting from quality issues with other hot pot concepts in China has further impacted sales at Little Sheep, even though there never was an issue with the quality of Little Sheep products.", "If this weak performance continues, we could be required to report a noncash special charge for the impairments of trademark, goodwill, and other assets later this year. We will continue to keep you posted on this.", "Moving to our other international businesses, we expect another solid year of sales growth at YRI, driven by record new unit development of at least 1,000 stores in 2013. Additionally, we continue to expect a record 150 new units in India, representing over 20% growth in total store count. And in the U.S., we\u2019re expecting solid profit growth, driven by continued strength at Taco Bell.", "So while our overall results for 2013 will be clouded by the temporary sales issues at KFC China, the balance of our portfolio is on track to deliver targeted growth. I will now share our preliminary thoughts on 2014.", "Based on our assumption that China sales are positive in the fourth quarter, we expect to exit 2013 with upward momentum. In addition, as we enter 2014 we will have opened about 1,600 new units in China over a two-year period.", "So with all of these units in the ground and operating, and assuming sales and margins recover as anticipated, we expect very strong growth in China operating profit in 2014. However, the magnitude of China\u2019s rebound next year will depend heavily on the shape of China\u2019s sales and margin recovery through the end of this year.", "As I\u2019ve mentioned several times before, the timing and trajectory of these recoveries is difficult to forecast. What we do know, however, is that China\u2019s long term growth potential hasn\u2019t changed, and we are uniquely well-positioned to capitalize on two powerful demographic trends that favor retail development in China: Number one, rising income levels, and number two, a rapidly growing consuming class.", "We also believe that our business models for YRI in the U.S. and India have never been better, which gives us the confidence to expect these businesses will deliver profit growth in 2014, consistent with our ongoing earnings model.", "Adding it all up, we are confident that Yum! is poised for a strong bounce back in EPS in 2014, and we look forward to providing a more detailed perspective on this at our December 4 meeting in New York.", "So to wrap things up, I have to say that I consider it a distinct privilege to be the CFO of a company that, even with the challenges in China, and how they\u2019ve weighed on our second quarter results, is committed to staying the course with its growth strategies. Importantly, we continue to make substantial investments behind these strategies because we believe in the durability of our growth model and the power and resilience of our brands.", "And with that, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan ", "Obviously when we talk about China, we talk a lot about the Yum-specific issues that have affected the first half of \u201913. But I was hoping we could maybe talk about the China macro. And to the best of your ability and your knowledge, can you separate what\u2019s happened specifically to you guys in chicken and talk about how the China macro may have potentially affected your rate of development and the development opportunities this year, pricing, and perhaps even overall traffic to western QSR. If there\u2019s any comments that you can make from a bigger picture perspective?", "David Novak ", "I think when we step back and we look at what\u2019s going on in China, and as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, I think the biggest thing we see going on in China continues to go on, and that\u2019s that the consuming class continues to grow. You know, it\u2019s 300 million today, it\u2019s expected to be 600 million people by 2020. And this is backed up from a number of different sources.", "And as Pat just mentioned, we also see disposable income growing as well. The economy itself is growing 7%, which still makes it the fastest-growing economy in the world. So those are things that I think bode well for brands that are consumer-oriented.", "When you look at just the infrastructure, what\u2019s going on in China, it continues to expand at a rapid rate. I think China\u2019s building over 90 airports, six of which will be at least as big as O\u2019Hare airport. Train stations are expanding, subway lines. All these really represent fantastic opportunities for our brand.", "And you know, I think what\u2019s happening in China today is still unprecedented. It\u2019s the largest urbanization effort in the history of the world. And I think that Yum! Brands, and our position competitively, is stronger than any restaurant company in this world.", "And I think what we\u2019re seeing, and Pizza Hut\u2019s great evidence of this, is that if you have innovation and you have value, and an economy like China has today, you can have very strong same-store sales growth and you can open up new units very profitably and move into lower-tier cities and expand very aggressively.", "And that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing with Pizza Hut casual dining in spite of all the, I guess you could say, headwinds that might exist in the market. So at the end of the day, we continue to be very bullish on China. And when you look at the long term, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anyone.", "And I think that this country is going to continue to grow very rapidly, and we\u2019re seeing it today. There\u2019s a bit of a slowdown, but their slowdown is, I think, a pretty rapid rate when you compare it to what\u2019s going on everywhere else in the world.", "So, again, you know, we find this to be true everywhere in the world. When you have powerful brands, you innovate, you provide everyday affordable value, you operate your business well with good service, you can win. So what we\u2019re focused on doing in China is continuing to innovate, continuing to work on our value equation, continue to upgrade our assets, continue to open into the new trade areas, because we think it\u2019s a winning proposition over the long term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Siegner with Credit Suisse.", "Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse ", "Just to follow up on John\u2019s question a little bit, and maybe try to get a little bit more specific, when you think about, even if we\u2019re decelerating to what\u2019s still in absolute terms a great pace of growth for the economy, what could this do to that mid-teens wage inflation outlook you talked about? This quarter came in a little bit lighter. Is it still a mid-teens wage growth inflation outlook that you\u2019re looking for? Or could we end up seeing something slightly slower?", "Pat Grismer ", "Keith, you\u2019re right. We did see the inflation on labor moderate a bit in the quarter. But that was more due to some productivity initiatives that helped to mitigate what would have otherwise been a rate of inflation consistent with the guidance we provided, which over the long term is driven by what the government\u2019s policies are around driving an increase in disposable incomes, which continues to be in the mid-teens range.", "Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse ", "So then one follow up question. As we think about pricing and how fiscal \u201812\u2019s price increases kind of roll off mid third quarter, how do you think about your ability to raise pricing? In an environment, we just talked about that has fairly meaningful cost inflation, how do you think about - is it the macro factors that most influence this? Do you need to see traffic back to a certain level? Do you plan to take pricing? Anything around those plans for the back half and into next year would be very helpful.", "Pat Grismer ", "At present we have no new pricing actions planned. Our number one goal is to regain the traffic that we\u2019ve lost over the last few months, and we\u2019re confident we can do that based on the trends we\u2019ve seen to date. We know that it\u2019s important to provide consumers with innovation and compelling value, and so it\u2019s not our expectation that we would be taking more pricing later this year.", "Now, obviously the situation is very different at Pizza Hut, where we remain in a position of significant strength with our brand. And we have taken some pricing this year, and consistent with our growth model for that business, we may take pricing later this year. But in the case of KFC, given where we\u2019re at today with the brand and our goal to rebuild the brand for the long term, we\u2019re not expecting to take additional pricing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer ", "When I look at the store level margins for China, your labor cost deleverage was a lot less severe this quarter than Q1. So it looks like the cost control has obviously tightened. And I know you just talked about some labor productivity, but your same-store labor costs look like they were actually down over 8%.", "So when we think about sales reramping, how important is it going to be for you guys to stress maybe some of the newfound cost controls you\u2019ve found, or some of the productivity initiatives you\u2019ve found, so that you can allow the operating leverage to really flex itself as those sales come back?", "And you talked about operating leverage a little bit. Maybe other than the labor line, maybe you could point out some other sources of operating leverage as sales come back, and how we should think about the China margins.", "Pat Grismer ", "The operating leverage actually has a greater impact on our occupancy and other costs. We have a much higher component of fixed cost. We do get the operating leverage benefit on the labor line, though, that\u2019s true. But we do expect that the productivity initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place will sustain and will contribute to an improving margin over time. The single biggest lever as it relates to our path back to higher margins is first regaining the transactions that we\u2019ve lost, and beyond that to continue to build new sales layers. Because that\u2019s ultimately what allows us to leverage the fixed costs in our business.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer", "And just a quick follow up. If you can talk about possibly the food cost dynamics in China right now and how your food cost outlook is shaping up.", "Pat Grismer ", "You may recall in New York what we had estimated for the China division for the full year was about 3% food cost inflation. Thankfully, due to favorable trends, primarily in chicken and cheese, we\u2019re now expecting food inflation to be about flat on the year. What we\u2019ve seen year to date is deflation. So we saw about 5% deflation in Q1, 3% deflation in Q2. We don\u2019t expect that deflationary trend to continue balance of year. We expect to land on roughly flat for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass with JPMorgan.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "From Morgan Stanley. Could I ask, just following up on the, I understand about the labor productivity savings. That makes sense. But occupancy only grew 5% in U.S. dollars. And unit growth was 3X that rate. So is there a substantial variable piece to occupancy, and that\u2019s why that\u2019s occurring? What else would cause that line to decelerate so much from a growth perspective?", "Pat Grismer ", "Included in that line is rent and about half of our leases in China have a variable component. Also included in that line is advertising expense, which also tends to be variable.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "And was that particularly variable this quarter? In other words, did you reduce advertising spend this quarter?", "Richard Carucci", "John, we did take the advertising rate up just a bit in the quarter.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "So not down, up?", "Richard Carucci ", "That\u2019s correct.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "And then can you talk about G&A globally? There were some reductions that looked like, from a dollar perspective, some of it came from the U.S., year ago period comparison, but it feels like there was also maybe some reductions, both maybe at corporate and certainly in China. What were those? How sustainable are those? Are those just tied to compensation, or were they in other areas?", "Richard Carucci ", "Definitely there were some overlap issues I think we called out, but in terms of anything one time, I don\u2019t think there was really anything unusual in the quarter.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "And how material is Little Sheep? I understand there\u2019s maybe an impairment risk, but is there a risk that if these trends continue to be poor, that there\u2019s going to be some risk to the China margin that\u2019s material enough to call out, or there\u2019s some risk to earnings in the back half because of it?", "Pat Grismer ", "No, consistent with what we\u2019ve disclosed in the past, the operating results of Little Sheep are not material to the China division results today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ", "On the labor line in China, expenses grew 9% in the quarter, which is less than unit growth, despite some inflation. So obviously you were able to reduce hours, which I think you guys were calling productivity initiatives. Can you maybe be more specific? Where were you able to cut back on labor at the store level in China? And then how do we think about 2014? Are these efficiencies you\u2019ll be able to carry with you that you found in the business? Or are you going to have to flex labor hours back up when sales recover?", "Pat Grismer ", "There were actually two things going on with China labor in the quarter. The first is that because the adverse sales impact of the avian flu, publicity was more pronounced in Shanghai than in other parts of the country. And in Shanghai, as you know, we have some of the higher labor rates. The mix of our labor across the division benefited from that, and that contributed a bit to the labor favorability we saw in the quarter.", "And then the second piece is around the team\u2019s ability to implement tighter controls around labor utilization and a more optimal mix of part time and full time employees.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ", "And then you guys talked about some catalysts for KFC China later this year, including new news on chicken. Can you give us just anything on what to expect there? I mean, are we talking step change type innovation? Anything you could share would be helpful.", "David Novak ", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d characterize it as step change, but we think it\u2019s very solid. That\u2019s how we characterize it. And we really wouldn\u2019t want to go into detail on that in the call.", "Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs ", "And then maybe one last clarification. June same-store sales improved to minus 10, can you tell us anything about the compares so we understand the context of that figure, meaning was June last year weak disproportionately for any reason? Or is the improvement to minus 10 in June a clean, sequential improvement and indicative of the trajectory of their recovery?", "Rick Carucci ", "We\u2019ve made the judgment not to break out the quarters. We reported the quarterly comps last year, and we\u2019re going to continue to report the monthly numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research.", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ", "David, you mentioned the opportunity around transportation areas. I believe maybe some data was given at the analyst day in December. Could you just give us a sense of how many stores are near transportation hubs, and where you see that unit growth opportunity? It seems like that type of unit development might be a little less vulnerable to food safety related issues and perhaps macro-related shocks.", "David Novak ", "I\u2019d have to go back and get the exact number on that, but we can get back to you on that.", "Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ", "And while I\u2019m on the line, if I could separate ask about YRI, in the emerging markets you had a very strong comps growth. Can you maybe give us a sense of where the strength was? Was it broad-based? Were there any areas of weakness? And within emerging markets, Africa has been talked about a lot, and maybe just long term, can you give us a sense of when you think Africa could start being a profit contributor?", "Rick Carucci ", "We highlighted on the call Russia and South Africa were the big drivers. If you talk about the impact of South Africa, you have to think of it as two pieces. South Africa right now has the lion\u2019s share of the business, so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to impact the current year\u2019s results. And so South Africa has been performing very well. Over time, the cumulative impact of it, as we enter these new African countries, will come into play, but it\u2019s probably not going to have a material impact on YRI\u2019s results for the next two or three years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Omohundro with Davenport Securities.", "Jeff Omohundro - Davenport Securities", "My question is regarding Taco Bell and the DLT rollout of Cool Ranch. Just wondering about the pacing of product, compared with nacho cheese. And when looking at the Flamas that\u2019s coming, what\u2019s your sense about the potential of this product versus Cool Ranch? And then lastly, on this same topic, this seems to me relatively rapid pacing of new flavors in this new sales layer. Just wondering how sustainable this model might be going forward in the longer term.", "Rick Carucci ", "Well, you know, I think consumers maybe wouldn\u2019t call it fast-paced. As soon as we launch nacho cheese Doritos, people got the joke and they were almost asking for Cool Ranch Doritos Locos Tacos. So we actually had to wait a little longer than we would have liked to, just because the demand was so great on the nacho cheese. We couldn\u2019t get the supply we needed to launch the Cool Ranch.", "I think we think of them both as separate flavors, but also part of a portfolio. So when you saw us launch the Cool Ranch, clearly we were trying to introduce the news, and a lot of our social media was oriented towards that. So we asked consumers, in fact our fans, to come out. And they were able to try it before we even advertised the product.", "But when we advertised it, we also used the slogan \u201cCollect all two\u201d. We wanted to reinforce we still had the nacho cheese piece. So we look at that as a portfolio and we\u2019re looking at adding to that portfolio. We originally thought that would be early next year. We\u2019re still evaluating the timing of that. We could right now forward possibly a little bit into this year.", "So we\u2019re excited about it, and I think that those will be the main three brands in terms of flavors. I think after that you\u2019ll probably see some more flavors, but they may be either in and out type of ideas. We\u2019re obviously very excited about the results we\u2019ve got as well as the future potential to add other flavors.", "David Novak ", "I think the only thing to add on that is that no one else has this. It\u2019s pretty nice when you have products that nobody will ever have but us. So it\u2019s a platform that is totally unique to Taco Bell, and so every time we advertise it, whether we have product news or not, we\u2019re advertising something that no one else has.", "And, you know, as Rick said, we\u2019ve started out with two biggies. The two biggest Doritos flavors are nacho cheese and Cool Ranch. We\u2019ve hit on them. Flamas is obviously a much smaller segment. But it does give us an opportunity to come back and [pulse news].", "I think the big thing about Doritos Locos Tacos is no one else has it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ", "I have a question on the longer term vision for the China margins and the type of recovery you\u2019re expecting. I think you\u2019ve talked about 20% margins longer term. I\u2019m just wondering what type of average unit volume you might need to see over the next couple of years to get back to that level. Is it just a matter of recapturing the sales that you\u2019ve lost over the last year or so? Or do you need to go beyond that to get back into the really high teens or close to 20%?", "Pat Grismer ", "You\u2019ll recall that prior to the onset of the poultry supplier incident in late December, we were at about 18%. So step one is to regain the traffic that we lost. And we therefore have a high degree of confidence that as that happens, we will return to that level. In terms of getting back to 20%, we still consider that an appropriate target for our business, because nothing structural has occurred to prevent that.", "And so as we think about the drivers that are going to get us back to the 20% target, beyond regaining the transactions that we lost, and also benefitting from the recovery in average check, I would say there are three factors. The first is continuing to build sales layers. We\u2019ve been very successful at this over the years, introducing new day parts and new occasions that put us in a position to leverage our fixed costs.", "The second is to continue to evolve our new unit development strategy. As we\u2019ve indicated before, we are shifting our new unit openings increasingly to lower-tier cities for KFC and more broadly to Pizza Hut casual dining, which is comfortably, today, above 20%. And so with those changes to our development program, we\u2019ll see a benefit that will get us closer to that target of 20%.", "And the final piece is given the strength of our competitive position over time to take pricing where it makes sense. You probably recall that our ongoing earnings growth model for China requires mid single digit same-store sales growth in order to offset inflation and maintain our margins.", "Based on the inflation that we\u2019ve experienced maybe over the last year and our decision not to take pricing, there will be a point in time where we may need to leverage the strength of our competitive position to take a bit more to get to the 20. I think it\u2019s fair to say that that is an appropriate target, but it will be very challenging to get to 20% in 2014.", "But you know, make no mistake, we will have a high-margin business in China. It\u2019s difficult to say when we\u2019re going to hit that 20%, but you have to remember that we manage our brands for the long term. We\u2019re not chasing a 20% margin. We\u2019re not focused on getting there next year, for example.", "We love our competitive position, and even with the 18% margins we had going into the supplier issue, we had three-year cash paybacks because we have such an exceptional asset turnover ratio. It\u2019s a powerful investment model for our shareholders, and we see extraordinary returns continuing at Pizza Hut. So we think the 20% is an appropriate target, and we have a path to get there over time.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ", "And just one quick follow up on the step one of getting back towards that 18% figure. And given you\u2019ve absorbed some inflation this year, and you\u2019re likely to see some inflation next year, what type of rebound in the comps might you need to see next year to get back to that 18%? Or is that an unrealistic target for next year?", "Pat Grismer ", "Well, given where we\u2019re at in our recovery, and we are seeing those improving trends, it\u2019s premature to have such a detailed conversation around 2014. We continue to believe that we will see the strong bounce back. We\u2019ll provide a more detailed perspective, as we typically do, at our analyst conference in December. And at that time we can provide you more insight into the extent to which same-store sales and pricing and inflation will play into our margin recovery over the course of 2014.", "The last thing I will say is that based on our past experience with these things, the recovery curve, or the recovery trend, is rarely linear. So, you know, it\u2019s just important to keep that in mind. We\u2019re giving you our best estimate. We reaffirmed that we expect the fourth quarter to be positive for China. And that will provide us the momentum that we need going into 2014 to see the strong bounce back next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andy Barish with Jefferies.", "Andy Barish - Jefferies", "Just a couple of quick ones. On the promotional side of things, was wings something that you kind of brought on? Or was it in the plan to kind of go back to value? And then just secondly, on the overall China development, can you frame it with just kind of a broader perspective on the percentage of openings in kind of tiers three through six going forward versus sort of what it has been historically, I guess?", "Pat Grismer ", "Well, on the development front, we are continuing to shift. It\u2019s not something that changes dramatically overnight. But I can assure you that there are two key shifts occurring in our new unit development program. For KFC, moving increasingly to tier three and below cities and increasing significantly the number of Pizza Hut casual dining openings.", "David Novak ", "And as far as wings go, wings are very popular in China. And we promote them generally in the summer period. And so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s extraordinary, out of the realm of what we typically do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.", "Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "Just a couple of questions focused on this year if I could. The tax rate is coming in a little lower than what you guided to. Do you think that will be the case for the full year? Or are you thinking something less than 27% for the full year now?", "Pat Grismer ", "It\u2019s not uncommon for us to see some unevenness or volatility, if you will, from one quarter to the next. I think it\u2019s early at this stage to provide guidance that was different from what we provided in December, which was about 27% for the full year.", "Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "And then the wage rate inflation, what did it run this quarter? And you mentioned a mid-teen rate, but hasn\u2019t it been well below that so far this year? And would you expect it to remain below that?", "Pat Grismer ", "So we\u2019re talking specifically about China labor inflation. Q1 was in the mid teens range. Q2 was high single digits. In terms of where we\u2019re going to land on a full year basis, it could be in the high single digits to low double digit range. As I said before, when we look longer term, we continue to expense something in the mid teens range.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ", "Just two questions. One just a follow up on the China side. It seems like the recovery is going along the expected trajectory, but I\u2019m curious about the approach going forward. Pat, you mentioned the outlook for \u201914 is somewhat heavily dependent on the sales and margin recovery in \u201913. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk a little bit about value and the promotions you might be thinking about. Better still, if you want to talk specifically on that, is margin a focus at all? Or is it all about achieving the desired full sales recovery at all costs? And then I had a Taco Bell follow up.", "Pat Grismer ", "Well, it is premature to talk in any detail around 2014. We wanted to give you a sense for what we expect next year, which is the strong bounce back. Certainly value is an important element of any brand strategy, along with breakthrough innovation, and our plan is to continue to offer both.", "David Novak ", "We never go after a recovery at any cost. We run a business. We\u2019ve got a business to run, and we want to have a long term, sustainable business model and brand proposition. So we\u2019re basically running the business the way we think it ought to be run, so that we\u2019re relevant to customers on a continual basis. And we\u2019re not doing anything that\u2019s overly dramatic.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ", "And just a follow up on the Taco Bell. I know in your prepared remarks you mentioned the breakfast rollout. I guess it\u2019s on track for \u201914. Any color you can give in terms of the sales lift you were getting in test, or the potential impact of the comp, or any impact that might have had on the core lunch and dinner business? Any color around breakfast relative to lunch and dinner and what contribution that could make?", "Rick Carucci ", "Not really at this stage. We may know a little bit more. We\u2019re sort of dialing up some of our product ideas and advertising for later this year, and at that point we may have a better read for what exactly could happen.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ", "But in test is there any color around the sales mix or the profit contribution or anything like that?", "Rick Carucci ", "The sales mix has been around the 4% range, but this is before we\u2019ve now dialed it up. So like I said we have plans to dial it up in the fall, and once we dial it up, both advertising and adjusting our product line, we may have a better read.", "David Novak ", "Okay, since there aren\u2019t any more questions, let me wrap this up by just saying that this was a slug it out quarter for Yum! Brands on our way to recovery in China. While our second quarter EPS declined 16%, it was generally in line with our expectations.", "The good news is that KFC China sales are recovering as expected. At Yum! Restaurants International in our India division we expect record unit development this year, and our new unit pipeline has never been stronger. Our estimated mid single digit full year EPS decline versus prior year remains unchanged.", "And importantly, we expect a strong bounce back year in 2014 as we continue to aggressively invest behind our core strategies and capitalize on the enormous growth opportunities we see around the world. We continually say we\u2019re on the ground floor of global growth, and that continues to be the case.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thank you very much.

(Operator Instructions)", "Thank you. Mr. Schmitt, VP of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thank you, Shawn. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from David and Pat, we will take your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements.

All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.", "In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum!

And our 2014 New York Investor and Analysts conference would be on Thursday, December 11, in Midtown Manhattan. ", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Novak.", "David Novak ", "Thank you, Steve. And good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report Yum! Brands is well on its way to delivering in full-year EPS growth of at least 20% with second-quarter EPS growth of 30% excluding special items. Just as important, I'm confident we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that will sustain double-digit EPS growth in 2015 and beyond. Looking at the quarter, we are obviously pleased with the continued progress we are making at KFC and China as evidenced by strong sales in margin growth as well as improving new unit returns. Our KFC Division which is our second largest profit contributor behind China also continues to deliver solid sales and profit. When taken together, our China and KFC Divisions comprise nearly two third of our total operating profit. So it's great to see both performing well. Another highlight is our Taco Bell breakfast platform is off to a great start and we expect to build up this momentum going forward. ", "Now let me give you more color on each of our divisions. Let's begin with China. Our China Division delivered system sales growth of 21% in the quarter as we opened 104 new units and grew same store sales 15%. It's great to see such a strong top line growth. And fortunately this top line growth flowed through nicely to the bottom line as operating profit grew an impressive 188%. The China team deserves a lot of credit for doing an excellent job driving restaurant margins of almost 17% during the quarter and over 19% in the first half. ", "At KFC China, our goal is to improve our already strong economic model and make KFC which is the number one, most popular brand in China, even more youthful, contemporary and energetic. We've maintained our value anchors and still have 6 RMB breakfast offerings and 15 RMB lunch offerings but have shifted our focus from price value led growth to higher quality and more profitable transaction growth. Our primary focus going forward will be on more premium innovation, delivered with the superior customer experience. ", "We are confident we are on the right path to evolve KFC into an even better, higher quality and more profitable business model as we keep the brand contemporary. With the recent launch of the KFC menu revamp in our more than 4600 restaurants in over 950 cities across China, we introduced 15 new products at one time and leverage four popular celebrities to promote four signature product platforms. Our campaign clearly resonates with consumers as KFC delivered same store sales growth of 21% in the quarter. It's important to note that while our guest check has increased, our value scores have also improved. In addition to intensive product innovation, we are enhancing the customer experience with a launch of redesigned packaging, contemporary staff uniforms, new menu board, branded service and a new restaurant design which we will be rolling out over time. On the digital front, we began rolling out free Wi-Fi. We also have a new mobile app coming which will provide consumers the convenience of pre-ordering with electronic payment. And we have more exciting news coming balance of the year. ", "So let me sum things up for KFC China. We are confident we are presenting an even better KFC our customers will continue to appreciate, and a business model that is rapidly improving new unit return, setting us up for continued, aggressive development in the future. ", "Turning to Pizza Casual Dining which is arguably one of the greatest success stories in our industry the past few years. We are clearly the number one western Casual Dining chain in China with hardly any mid scale competition. And if you follow us, you know pizza Casual Dining goes well beyond pizza. As almost two thirds of our sales are non pizza items bringing our pizza and more positioning to life. During the quarter, we delivered system sales growth of 16% and opened 36 new units further strengthening our category leading position. Same store sales were flat in the quarter but keep in mind we are overlapping 7% positive same store sales in 2013, which was our strongest quarter last year. Looking ahead, we have exciting product news coming and the business is on track to deliver another solid year in 2014. Most importantly, the business model and new unit returns are firing on cylinders with two year cash paybacks. In fact, we are aggressively expanding into lower tier cities. We are now in 305 cities and expect to have over 1200 units by the end of the year. That's more than double our unit count only three years ago. And we are just getting started.", "Now the other exciting thing about pizza is our separate and distinct Pizza Home Service business where we deliver an all meal home replacement to Chinese customers. In fact, over 40% of the menu consists of Chinese food. We have borrowed from the innovation and know how we develop with East Dawning, our Chinese fast food concept. So not only are we delivering pizza but we are delivering a full array of Chinese menu options in a small box format that will drive aggressive expansion. We believe we have innovated our way to not only offer a pizza but Chinese food in a scalable, highly profitable fast food format. We now have over 200 units in 26 cities and we are really beginning to rapidly scale this brand across the country. So with the strong foundation in place and with enormous demand for home meal replacement in China that will only grow over time, we expect our Pizza Hut Home Service business will contribute more meaningfully in the years ahead. ", "Last but not least, we continue to work hard to turnaround Little Sheep which is clearly been a major disappointment and continues to be so since we acquired it in 2012. We like to take a step back and look at the big picture of China. We'll always be focused on improving our unit economics by growing average unit volumes. But what excites us the most is the largest component of our ongoing growth model in China is new unit development. And we are as confident as ever we are still on the ground floor with constant, aggressive expansion ahead. That's because in China, we now generate three year cash paybacks at KFC as we've improved the business model, and two year cash paybacks of Pizza Casual Dining. New unit returns are outstanding for these two power brands and importantly our overall returns are getting stronger as we continue to shift more of our development to pizza at Casual Dining and KFC in tier 3 through 6 cities where our unit economic returns are strongest and the consuming population is getting larger and larger.", "In terms of new unit potential the macro trend we remain most enthusiastic about is the large and growing consuming class which is expects to double from 300 million people in 2012 to 600 million people by 2020. And disposable incomes are growing right alongside it. In 2014, we fully expect to open at least 700 new units, and the long-term outlook is bright for KFC, Pizza Casual Dining and now Pizza at Home Service. ", "Moving to India. As discussed, we have made the strategic decision to invest ahead of the growth curve to develop a business that we are confident will drive substantial growth for Yum! in the years ahead. We currently have over 700 units and we are full steam ahead with this development as we expect to open another 150 new units this year. We are well on our way to a target of 2000 units by 2020. We are hopeful the new political leadership in India will create a stronger economy and more pro business environment as we invest in this country with they have well over a billion people. ", "Now let me shift -- now let me show you some perspective on our three brand divisions starting with KFC. Our KFC division which generates over 90% of its profit outside the United States, deliver a solid second quarter led by strong international performance. Importantly, our international new unit pipeline remained extremely robust. We expect to open at least 650 new units outside the United States this year and grow operating profit consistent with our full year guidance of more than 10%. I recently attended KFC's global marketing planning meetings in Dallas where we had nearly 30 countries represented in one room. Now during these meetings all our CMOs from around the world share their marketing calendars and plans for the coming year. There is no question we are building more know how and getting better at advertising, innovation, value and digital. Our expectation is this will result in higher same store sales growth in the years ahead. And even though we have nearly 14,000 restaurants in over 110 countries around the world with only two KFC restaurants per million people outside the United States, we still have a long runway for future growth. Our business model is powerful and our development pipeline is strong. ", "Now let me give you an update on pizza. We are obviously disappointed with second quarter result. In particularly with the very poor performance in U.S. business which contributes about half of pizza's divisions total profit. We now expect full year operating profit at pizza to fall well short of our initial expectations. We've had our ebbs and flows versus the competition over the years, and I can assure we will be back. In fact, we intent to launch a number of major initiatives in the United States to reignite sales beginning in the fourth quarter. Our plan is to launch a major new advertising positioning along with the innovation designed to better connect with millennials and separate us from competition. To this end, I encourage you to try our new Hershey dessert cookie. You should also know we will sharpen our focus on value and tend to leverage our more competitive offers to drive digital activations. Our goal is not only to catch the competition on the digital front but to surpass it in 2015. We know we have great brand to work with the Pizza Hut. Even with our recent challenges in the United States, pizza has the highest average unit volumes at our category in over 2800 more restaurants than our nearest U.S. competitor. Over the past two years, we've also been outgrowing the competition in terms of new unit development. In fact, we expect our fourth consecutive year of positive net new unit growth. Importantly the majority of new units will be opened by franchisee which speaks to the strength of Pizza Hut business model. All of this gives us confidences going forward and we expect to show significant progress balance of the year in 2015. ", "Globally we are sharing best practices to drive sales growth and we are making focused investments to accelerate our pace of new unit development especially across the delivery and express channels. We expect to open a record 450 international new units this year for Pizza Hut and expect this number to growth significantly in the years ahead. ", "So to sum it up, we are bullish on our long-term growth prospects at pizza. We are confident we have the right teams in place, plans and structure. We expect much better performance going forward and to make significant progress by the yearend. ", "Finally, at Taco Bell, obviously the big news for the brand is that on March 27, it will be day they'll go down in history as we launch our national breakfast platform. Here the facts. Our breakfast day part mix around 7% of sales in the second quarter. We fully expect breakfast to be incremental. And anywhere from $70,000 to $120,000 per unit in annualized sales. Remember, McDonald's get about a million dollar in sales before we have even open our doors in the past. This is a huge opportunity for Taco Bell. And we are already making money in breakfast even though we've added incremental labor and food cost are slightly higher. We generated tremendous buzz around our products and marketing and we actually celebrated a record breaking sales week in the quarter. And for the long term there is now question we've enhanced our brand position as the choice of the new generation. And in fact, Taco Bell is recently recognized by MPV Crest for being one of only three restaurant brands to over index with millennials along with Starbucks and Chipotle.", "So overall, we are extremely pleased with the breakfast launch and the direction we are heading for Taco Bell. Now the big question you probably asking is this given the success of the breakfast launch, why did same store sales increased only 2% in the quarter? Keep in mind that during the first two months of the quarter, our immediate emphasis was almost totally on breakfast. Once we returned to advertising our core business, it was with Cool Ranch Spicy Doritos Locos Tacos chicken. And frankly, this product underperformed versus our expectation. We believe that ended up being too much of a niche product to overlap the 15% growth we've had over the past few years with the introduction of Doritos Locos Tacos and then Cool Ranch, two of the most popular product introductions in the history of our entire category not just Taco Bell. Nevertheless, Taco Bell same store sales were positive 2% in the quarter. And we said all along the Taco Bell would be a first half second half story. In fact, trends have improved with the recent launch of Quesarito which proves that when you have great innovation, balance a day, coupled with a strong breakfast line, it is a powerful combination. ", "Looking ahead, we will be introducing mobile ordering and we have significant value innovation plan in our core business to drive growth balance of the year and beyond. Our franchisees are in breakfast to win and they have been also cheering us on to broaden our breakfast offerings with new products that we already in the pipeline. All-in-all, we are pleased to have lots of innovation coming across all day past to drive growth in a very challenging environment. Today's launch of our Power Cantina menu, a line of high protein products that I love is just another example. Importantly, our ongoing product innovation is backed by solid operations and attractive unit economics which allow us to open over 100 net new units this year representing a 10 year high. We are confident; we will ultimately achieve our goal of at least 8000 Taco Bell restaurants in the United States by leveraging our asset throughout the day. We have great progress now at breakfast. We have happy hour, we have the fourth meal, and we see this as a power brand that can be leveraged throughout the day. ", "Now taking a step back when you look at Yum! in total, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on the three things that drive shareholder value and retail. Driving new unit development, building same store sales and doing this in a way that generates high return. In terms of development, our new unit opportunity in emerging markets remains the best in retail. We have a two to one lead over our nearest competitor in emerging market and our opportunity to expand remains enormous. We have only two restaurants per million people in emerging market compared to 58 per million people in the United States today. Clearly, this is a long runway for growth and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come. Furthermore, we have over 40,000 restaurants around the world with all kinds of ideas in hopper and clearly significant capacity to grow same store sales in average unit volumes. The fact we have under leveraged asset is a great weapon as we go into the future. Meanwhile our returns on invested capital have consistently been among the highest in industry. Over 90% of our restaurants outside of China are owned and operated by franchisees. We simply love the franchise model which will generate about $2 billion of franchise fees in 2014. These franchisees provide us with a large, reliable and growing stream of cash which combined with a profit from our equity stores and enable us to invest in high return growth opportunities and return significant cash to our shareholders. ", "So let me wrap things up for Yum! Brands. On the whole, we are pleased with our overall second quarter and year-to-date results. We expect a strong bounce back year in China and solid full year performance in KFC. At Taco Bell, we are pleased with breakfast and confident in our balance of year plans and expect a much stronger second half. And at Pizza Hut, we expect full year operating profit to fall well below our initial expectations. We obviously have major work to do to get our pizza U.S. business on more competitive footing and we are confident that we will do so and transfer the learnings that we have around the globe. When you added all up, we expect full year EPS growth of at least 20%. Equally, important, I am confident we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that will sustain double digit EPS growth in 2015 and beyond.", "Now let me turn it over to Pat Grismer, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. My remarks today, I will cover three areas. Our second quarter result, our outlook for the second half of 2014 and what we are doing to drive long-term value for our shareholders. With the second quarter, our results were similar to Q1 with the very strong bounce back in China, solid growth at our KFC Division, mixed results at Taco Bell and poor performance at our Pizza Hut Division. Overall, worldwide operating profit increased 34% in constant currency and EPS grew 30% excluding special item. We've now produced two quarters of strong EPS growth and are well on our way to delivering on a commitment of at least 20% EPS growth this year. China Division profit rebound in sharply from the second quarter of 2013 which was the low point of last year and grew 188% in the quarter. Importantly, KFC same store sales improved sequentially on one and two year basis growing 21% in the quarter on the strength of a comprehensive restage of the KFC brand. And while Pizza Hut Casual Dining same store sales were flat in Q2, we are pleased that we grew system sales 16% with continued rapid development of this highly profitable concept. We are also very pleased with our continued margin improvement in China. With first half restaurant margin above 19% and with our current outlook for the second half, we are confident that China's full year restaurant margin will be at least 18% or nearly three points above 2013 and back to where we were in 2012. I am also very happy to report that China's new unit returns have strengthened considerably. As you recall from our December Investor Conference, cash paybacks at KFC in 2013 averaged a very respectable four years despite short term sales pressures. As David mentioned, with a recovery we've seen in our business this year, cash paybacks are new KFC restaurants in China are now three years. Pizza Hut Casual Dining cash paybacks in China remained very impressive two years. This is great news for our shareholders as we expect to open at least 700 new restaurants in China this year and paves the way for high return, new unit development in 2015 and beyond. As for our other divisions, KFC produced the very solid quarter with 12% profit growth in constant currency, a significant improvement over Q1. Taco Bell also improved versus Q1 but results were mixed in a challenging U.S. environment with profits declining 2% in the quarter. Taco Bell restaurant margin decreased 2.7 percentage point as we invested in our national breakfast launch and were impacted by commodity inflation of 5%. Now David mentioned, we are pleased with a national launch of breakfast and we know the business will benefit from this additional sales layer for years to come. We continue to expect much stronger results in the second half from Taco Bell. Our Pizza Hut U.S. division on the other hand is in turnaround mode. We expect results to improve balance of year but Pizza Hut Division to fall well short of our initial expectations. As CFO I can assure that we are not holding back from making strategic investments to right the ship. We are strengthening our global digital capability and investing in field level G&A to open new Pizza Hut market and accelerate our pace of new unit development. I expect our investments in international development to begin paying dividend this year with record new unit openings and to see results from our digital investments and other brand building initiatives in 2015. ", "Now I would like to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year. In China, we expect to achieve at least 40% operating profit growth for the full year excluding the impact of foreign exchange driven by improvements in both sales and restaurant margins. We expect restaurant margins to remain strong as we remained diligent and making our labor model more efficient at our KFC business. Margins will also continue to benefit from our move towards higher quality, more profitable transaction as well as our development shift to lower tier cities for KFC and a higher mix of Pizza Hut restaurants. Partially offsetting this, we are expecting commodity inflation of about 3% and modestly higher labor inflation that we saw in the first half of the year. So when you added all up, we are expecting full year margins of at least 18% as I said earlier or back to where we were in 2012 even with the diluted impact of Little Sheep. Sales in China continued to be difficult to predict. Our best estimate is that with the more difficult overlapped we faced in the back half of the year, and with the current trends we are seeing in our business, full year same store sales growth will likely be towards the low end of our guidance range or in a high single digit. And as always if we can do better we will. Now David mentioned, Little Sheep results continued to be disappointing and diluted overall China restaurant margin by 0.6 percentage point in the quarter. We are continuing to focus on improving this business. However, if Little Sheep's performance does not improve, we may be required to further impair the business in the back half of the year. Outside of China, we expect KFC to continue to produce solid results. As I mentioned before, we expect Taco Bell profit performance to improve significantly in the second half as pricing should offset commodity inflation, breakfast builds momentum and higher margin products like the new Quesarito drive more dollars to the bottom line. We also expect Pizza Hut results to improve from the first half as we advanced our value proposition globally and bring more product innovation and more compelling value news and digital activation to the U.S. business. ", "Overall, we expect solid growth in the second half and are confident in delivering at least 20% full year EPS growth. And if we can do better, I assure you we will. ", "Now, I would like to share how we are driving long-term value for our shareholders. Yum! is reliable, cash generating machine. And this year we expect to generate over $3 billion in operating EBITDA, an all time high. This includes over $2 billion in franchise fees from our growing global and diversified royalty stream. We reinvest a substantial portion of our operating cash flow or about 40% to drive the growth our businesses. We also continue to optimize our equity portfolio by increasing the weight of high return businesses including emerging market overseas and Taco Bell in the U.S. where restaurants margins are in high teen. This has positioned us well for future earnings growth and importantly has set us up to achieve higher returns on invested capital which we expect will top 20% in 2014. Second, we pay a dividend which we have grown at double digit rate every year since we first paid a dividend over nine years ago making us one of only 11 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. Our dividend yield is currently just under 2% which is very competitive for a company with our growth profile. And third, after investing behind growth and paying a meaningful dividend, we return all available cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. Each of these levers are large and growing franchise business combined with high equity, high return equity investment, a growing dividend and value creating share repurchase worked together to drive strong returns for our shareholders. ", "So let me wrap things up. We are pleased with our strong second quarter results which were led by outstanding performance in our China Division and solid growth at our KFC Division. Our strong start to the year coupled with our ongoing growth investments has clearly set us up to deliver on a strong bounce back year that we expected in 2014. I am confident in the strength of our business model and we will continue to make the investment necessary to sustain double digit EPS growth over the long term. ", "And with that, we will be very happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "(Operator Instructions)", "Your first question comes from the line of Keith Siegner, your line is open.", "Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets", "Thank you very much. I was wondering if you could give a little more details on the China same store sales breakdown in terms of price, mix and traffic? Assuming mix maybe was a big contributor here, where is the mix coming from? Is this the change in occasions? Is it less promotion etcetera? And then maybe how do you see those three pieces moving in the second half to jive with the guidance that you just gave for same store sales? Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Keith, very happy to do that. So we will focus on KFC where we are at 21% same store sale growth in the quarter. About half of that was driven by mix. And of that mix component the majority is attributable to the fact that we overlap a significant decline in high check family business. Now from last year, you may recall that from last year's result. Average spends however also benefited from the launch of our premium positioned menu revamp. So those two things together drove about half of that same store sales increase. Now we also had about four points to pricing which we felt good about considering that we took absolutely no pricing last year and that was more or less in line with inflation on a two year basis, and as far as we know in line with competition and then we had transaction growth that delivered another six points. I think the important thing here what I most pleased with is that despite the fact we had significant lift in average spend and we had a contribution from pricing, our value scores improved. Our value scores improved with the launch of our new menu. And they improve even with the pricing that we took. So we feel very good about the composition of our sales growth in the second quarter. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning. Pat, I just wanted to follow up on your outlook for the same store sales in China for the year. You mentioned that your expect comps to come in towards the lower end of your prior guidance. And I was just wondering if you could add some context to that statement. Is that because of -- simply because of a comparison that you are facing in the back half of the year or are you seeing any changes in the sequential volumes that might concern you and maybe point you more conservatively relative to your prior guidance. ", "Pat Grismer ", "Well, David, I think the first thing to point out is that we are confident that we are going to deliver at least 20% full year operating profit growth in China on the strength of our recovery and restaurant margin which I mentioned as the high end of our guidance range. Now as we said all along sales are difficult to predict with precision. And we know that China is a volatile market. But our best estimate today based on the currents that we see in our business is that sales, same store sales will likely be towards the lower end of our range. And it's with that combination of higher end margin and lower end sales if you will, so we get to that 40% operating profit growth that we need to deliver on our commitment of at least 20% EPS growth for the year. Now in terms of what driving the softer results in the back half of the year, you got to remember that we have adopted the strategy of pivoting towards higher quality, more profitable transaction and we feel very good about that because that yield a much healthier business model which bodes well for future development. The second piece is that is that the easiest overlap is behind us. Remember, in first half of last year sales were down 20%, same store sales were down 20% in China and in the back half same store sales were down only 7%. So yes we are lapping still in negative number but the overlap is harder in relative term. So it's combination of those things that we contribute to softer results in the second half versus the first half but again still ladder up to the 40% operating profit growth and the 20% EPS growth at least that we've committed to deliver. ", "David Novak ", "As I've always said in the past, we are going to always have bumps in the road with same store sales. In June, we had a Brazilian Samba themed promotion around football that frankly didn't resonate like we had hoped. We are now moving to signature value program where we borrow from the success we had at Pizza Hut where we are offering one of our revamp products per day at a half of the price, making it-- it is only product. And this has been part of our ongoing plans. So we are just beginning to launch that program. And it's early days; we will see how it does. But one thing that we know as Pat said more moving forward is that we are driving popular transaction trends and improving our business model. And importantly when we look at where we are at today, all of our major attributes for the brand are improving. We are the preferred brand, taste is better, value for the money is better and our safety score are back to where they were 2012. So the brand is certainly bouncing back and when we look at the whole China business in total, giving at least 40% profit growth this year and having at least high single digit sales growth for the full year. We feel very good about that. And it's a great base for us to move into 2015 and beyond. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West. Your line is open.", "Jason West - Deutsche Bank", "Yes, thanks. I guess just going back to the comments around the China unit economics and that the store growth outlook. I mean I guess given what you guys are seeing today in the improving economics is it fair to say you're going to sustain this sort of 700 gross opening rate going forward? Or would you like to see that number go higher over time or do you feel like-- you would like to moderate that number? Just if you could talk a little bit about that will be helpful. ", "Pat Grismer ", "Well, Jason, I can assure you we wouldn't moderate that number. We expect to deliver at least 700 new units this year that lapping the 740 from last year. We remain as bullish as ever about a long-term growth prospect in China and we feel very good about how our unit level economics have strengthened. David had said before that we did some of our very best work last year in the midst of crisis to make our business even better. And new unit, I know economics are as strong as they ever been. Even last year with the pressure that we felt on sales, we had four year cash payback of KFC, this year we are back to three years, that include tier three cities and below two and half year cash payback from KFC. Pizza Casual Dining cash payback have sustained at two years. So we feel very good about the position of our brand. We feel great about the overall returns we are seeing on this investment. And we have every reason to believe that we are going to try high levels of investment going forward, maintaining the high level of discipline and rigor around our capital investment products. ", "David Novak ", "I think the other thing that we think going forward we have another weapon in our arsenal with Pizza Home Service. And this is a small pack box format where we are delivering not only pizza but also Chinese food. We think we've actually kind of back our way into Chinese fast food format with great economics coupled with the pizza that allows to get some dramatic expansions we go into future. And again this is small box so the investments costs are not that significant. The main point I would like to make on this is that we have never ever chased a number. We obviously think it will be better than 700, we want to grow that number as we go forward. We are going to stay very, very disciplined as we have in the past. What I have told Sam and the team, and this will continue to be our policy as we've got these incredible brands. They are like diamonds. We need to polish those diamonds and only grow as faster as our people capability can allow us to do it and then we can get the right location in the right places that we need to be and as we go forward. And the beautiful thing about our business in China is that the business models are great. And the business is strong. We are not any hurry. We don't have to hurry. We just need to grow this business the right way. So we will be very focused, very disciplined, look at our returns and only grow as fast as the locations are there, we have a people capability. And remember, I think this year we hired a close to 10,000 management trainees that will come into our system and three years from now will be ready to be restaurant general managers. And we are doing that in anticipation of the significant growth that we expect to have across KFC, Pizza Casual Dining and now Pizza at Home Service. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer. Your line is open. ", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Question on Taco Bell. You mentioned Quesaritos is helping the non breakfast business. Have you been able to keep the breakfast sales stable even when you are pointing your advertising energy to non-breakfast items like Quesaritos. And in the second half we talk about specifically, should we be expecting--", "David Novak ", "Can you speak up David, we can't hear you. David? We can't hear you.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Can you hear me okay now?", "David Novak ", "I can hear you better now. We got the first half of the question I think but you might want to repeat it so everybody can hear it. ", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Let me just repeat that. We talk about; you mentioned Quesaritos is helping the non-breakfast business. Have you been able to keep breakfast sales stable even when you are pointing the advertising energy to the non-breakfast items like Quesaritos? And then in the second half just specifically with the P&L for Taco Bell, are we going to see significant digital launch cost as you roll that out for that brand? Thanks. ", "Pat Grismer", "David, I will go and address the digital launch cost. We do expect to be launching that later in the year sometimes in the fourth quarter. The additional investment against that is working and our forecast for the full year and we continue to expect that Taco Bell division profit will be about in line with their ongoing growth target about 6%. So those costs are loaded into our G&A forecast for the year.", "David Novak ", "And the breakfast numbers remain relatively stable. We feel very good about the base that we have with breakfast at Taco Bell. We have more news coming and we think we have the combination of the breakfast news plus the other day part news, give us the one two combination that we have to have to really go forward. I actually -- I think breakfast is just critical to us on a number of front. First of all, we got this assets with basically has been empty until 11 o'clock and so we regaining the leverage that asset, we are also leveraging on a profitable basis. Remember, I took that thing for McDonald eight years to make money in breakfast. We are already at above breakeven. So we feel good about get $70,000 to $120,000 in sales per unit on annual basis. So this is a great vehicle for us. And I think this category is very tough. You got to have constant innovation and to be able to innovate across all the important day parts to drive the same store sales versus just the traditional lunch and dinner day part. I think it gives an opportunity to even bring more consumer news, more excitement to the Taco Bell brand as we go forward. And regardless of what we market and how we market it, if you look at what we are doing it all drives the Taco Bell brand forward. The Ronald McDonald advertising took our overall brand imagery I think up to -- some of the highest levels we've ever seen. So we were building the brand in all that we do and now we can build the brand across all the day part. So I am very enthusiastic about breakfast. I just about month ago I was out in California meeting with Taco Bell franchisees. And they are into win, they are seeing now that this is really working for them. And they all understand that what this can do for their business over the long term. So when we got into this it was like how we get in with minimum investment, minimum products, and minimum complexities. Now the franchisees are saying, hey, bring us more new products. Let's really go after this. So that's a good thing. And we have obviously there is pockets of strengths where we are doing better than other places but overall we really are doing extremely well. We have a national proposition and we are going to stay after it. This is something that we are absolutely committed to make successful as we go into future. And we think we believe very much in the one-two punch. We think we got to have breakfast and we think we got to have the day part news -- product news to drive the other day part as well. So we have the Quesaritos, we have the protein group, protein line of products that we just introduced. We've got a number of values, initiatives coming forward with product innovation to go along with it. I think we had analysts meeting where many people tried lot of the products that we had up there, we had a very inventive group at Taco Bell and we think we are going to have a lot of news. So unlike some brands that are wondering what to do next, we've got day parts to leverage and we've got all kinds of product innovation that we can keep brining into hopper. So Taco Bell, we think is in very good shape and feels very good about the second half. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Company", "", "Thanks. Obviously the Pizza Hut business outside of China I guess continues to be drag on the profits. And obviously you are going to try to turn around that pizza business outside of China but I am just wondering if there is a scenario where as you are trying to do so maybe you look at possibly splitting that business off either through sale or spin. Or is that something that's not possible if you want to hold on to the China piece of pizza, if you could just talk about that and why you wouldn't maybe look at transaction like that?", "David Novak ", "Well, first and foremost we believe in the power of global brands and we believe we are very good at running global brands and we are going to be able to maximize the sales and profitability of that brand over the long term. We think our structures focus so that we can get after the opportunities that we have. And we think we are going to drive significant growth for pizza in the future. We are very bullish on pizza for the long term. Lot of what we've done this year, you really -- obviously you can't see in the numbers. But we are investing heavily and doing a globally along with digital front and also in terms of driving future development. We think we have significant opportunities in the delivery carry-out business and the express business. And we've got major new initiatives that will be implemented in the United States in terms of both the advertising positioning which we think will be global and also the innovation that we think will be global. And we believe that this will travel and we think we are going to get significant growth at our Pizza Hut in next year and beyond. So we think we are structured just fine. There are all kinds of things that you can do financially to think about reengineering the business and all kinds of scenarios have been brought up over the last 15 years. We look at everything but we are absolutely committed to our current structure, believe it's right and we think our shareholders, they are going to benefit from it over the long term.", "Pat Grismer", "Brian, what I would add to that just to build on David's point. We look at everything through a long-term growth plan so we don't over react to short-term issues in our business. And it wasn't two years ago that pizza was on top. We have a powerful brand. We can beat the competition. Things have softened last couple of years. We've taken our learnings and we are redoubling our efforts to bring the business back next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore. Your line is open.", "Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein", "Just a follow-up on China, if I may. The margins keep beating to the upside I think versus the investors' or Street expectations. Can you talk a little bit about why that is? Is it your costs like commodities and labor inflation are coming in lower than expected? I recognize that you got a lot of leverage and you have more profitable transactions from the menu revamp. But if you can just talk about that in the sense of the outlook for costs. And a related question is Pizza Hut is such a good business in China, the unit economics are still very good. Is the slower comp just the difficult compare? Is there something in the environment? Could it possibly be related to the acceleration in unit growth? Thank you.", "Pat Grismer", "Sara, I will take the question on China margin. We are absolutely delighted with the progress that we are making -- we are continuing make with the six point improvement in margin versus prior year in the second quarter. You are right that the menu revamp helped from a mix perspective as we pivot towards those more profitable, higher quality transactions. With respect to how things are trending and what gets us to the higher end of the range. You are also right that the inflation outlook has tampered. So where as at the beginning of the year we were expecting big higher inflation on food cost or closer to around 1% for the year and labor inflation is at the lower end of our range. We had guided low double digit. So it's going to be pretty close to 10%. So those things together bolster our confidence that we are going to get to at least 80% margin for China Division for this year. ", "David Novak", "I think regarding Pizza Hut and Casual Dining, in China obviously our same store sales were flat, is softer than what would have liked but we were overlapping 7% same store sales growth in 2013 which was the highest of that year. Our system sales growth is 16% in the second quarter. And our business model and returns are firing on cylinders. So we got two year cash paybacks on new units, we will have 20% plus margin for the full year. And remember we've grown our average unit volumes 30% in the past three years and we are doing this with basically no mid scale competition out there today or on the immediate horizon anyway. And we are expanding breakfast in more, more cities. We've now breakfast in 229 stores which is about 20% of our units. So we have a pretty amazing growth story and we are bullish as ever about the future growth prospect for Pizza Casual Dining. I think as we go forward we think we have the big story for pizza is to rapid new unit development that we have with two units -- two year returns. And with average unit volumes so they are already generating by themselves today 20% plus full year margins. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of John Ivankoe. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe - JPMorgan", "Hi, great, thank you. Actually a follow-up on that question. It sounds like maybe in the second half for KFC that same store traffic might be pretty close to flat given what your menu mix is. And from what I understand, pricing that was taken in the fourth quarter and maybe some more pricing that was taken in the second quarter. So, maybe elaborate on that. And if I may, it is unusual to see a company focus on margins in a recovery - allow lower traffic growth. In other words, you're not necessarily trying to gain back the traffic that you lost in the previous year. So David you're obviously very experienced just in terms of what you've seen over your career. May be an example of previous success where you can focus on a higher margin customer and almost willingly allow some of your lower-margin or maybe more price-sensitive customers drop out of the brand as you focus on overall profitability.", "David Novak ", "Well, John, I think first of all I don't think we are focused on margin. I think what we have been focused on is rebuilding the brand. And making the brand more contemporary for a changing China. And so I think the things that we are most excited about is that with revamp that we have, the comprehensive program we put it in terms of service, uniforms, where we headed with digital all the stuff, is where contemporary since the brand were changing in China. And the research measures basically are all moving in the right direction. So we are building the brand. We got preferred brand, taste, value for the money, safety is back where it was in 2012, all the measures that you want to see going up are going up. So I think first and foremost what Sam and team have been focused on is rebuilding the brand and rebuilding the brand the right way. We look back couple of years ago in 2012 I guess it was, at 2011 we had 20% transaction growth which kind of blew everybody away. And that came primarily from value driven transactions which are good. But they are not necessarily sustainable from a profit perspective in terms of really driving our business model for the long term. So what we've done now is we still have 6 RMB launches and breakfast in 15 RMB lunch items. But we shifted our marketing focus to more focusing on the premium one which we think is more in line with where consumers are going today. And as a result of that we are getting significant same store sales growth. Some traffic growth, but we get the much better business models as we go forward that we can build from. And we really like that as we think about where we are headed. So I don't think that we are just margin driven. I think we are very focused on building the brand and doing so in a manner that will strengthened our business model, that give us a best possible unit economics going forward, it will allow us to open up as many as restaurants as we can. ", "Pat Grismer", "And I will just add on that to say we are not going to comment on what we expect transaction growth to be in the back half of the year but building what I have said earlier, we do expect that comps in the second half, one is strong as they were in the first half in the part because we are lagging more challenging numbers. Also there is no reason to believe and you suggested that the pricing we've taken this year is putting pressure on pricing because of the --we mentioned value scores have improved with the brand we launch and with the pricing and we feel that the pricing we've taken is entirely in line with inflation and not ahead of competitors. ", "David Novak ", "I think that's a big point. We are improving the overall brand dynamics from preferred brand to value for the money scores, both are going up. And we've been very, very mindful of the pricing. When I think about building the brand from margin perspective I -- there is a very brands that I think have been that successful okay in terms of like getting their -- by taking price and not taking price smart way and all that. So you asked me, historically, what have I learned? I mean if you price without being aware of where you stand with your brand and what your brand is capable of doing, you go down a very slippery slope. But we have priced and reorganized our menu and restructured our menu and innovated around our menu to improve the brand dynamics and that's all the feedback we are getting from the customers telling us. They think the best time to take price is before you have big news. So we did in Chinese New Year for example. We did just before Chinese New Year. And then we also did it just before we did the revamp. And so I think the big point I am making is we are not building this brand from a margin perspective. We are building this brand from a brand perspective and we are doing it in a way that happens to get us better margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass.

And maybe help us more than - maybe just put some numbers or framework around how we should think about the full year.", "Pat Grismer ", "John, I am not providing any more specific guidance on full year performance out of the detailed division only to indicate that the results will be below our expectations this year, well below our expectations and we had guided that the results would be below the ongoing growth model that we had established for the division and I really don't care to provide anything more specific than that at the stage.

Again on the higher quality more profitable sales in KFC China, is there risk that you are going to confuse the consumer? In 2012, you hit value hard; so hard that on that great comp number, your margins got killed. And now in recovery mode, I'm not sure exactly how you're repositioning it higher -- if it's meal combinations or different offerings or what it is. But it sounds pretty different. And if you could elaborate on that, I'd appreciate it. And then just on Pizza Hut, the Pizza Hut international business was pretty weak also. Could you talk a little bit about that? And we're used to seeing Pizza Hut have a tough year, a good year, alternating. And this looks like two tough years in a row. And, again, if you could comment on more on the international piece, I'd appreciate it.", "David Novak ", "First of all on KFC. I don't think we are confusing the customers whatsoever. I mean I think the brand is just being presented in a new improved way. We still have value offerings. It is not like we are advertising on television, gee; there is no value at KFC today. We still have the 6 RMB breakfast, we still have the 15 RMB lunches. We are introducing news around new products and new advertising with celebrities. And I think people -- every brand measure is moving up and there is no -- we are not getting anything from customers that says they are confused. So I would say to answer that is no problem. ", "Pat Grismer ", "And what I would say as well we all know from our experience the great brand follow the customer and give the customer what the customer wants. And consumers in China are ecstatic. Their expectations are increasing. They are becoming even more so sophisticated and this is what they want. We are giving them what they want. That's what they are telling us. ", "David Novak ", "But I think consumers want great value which we have, best in the category. And getting basis what the number-- best of we've had. They want great taste which is we know is proven -- our measures are high and we are the preferred brand. So I think KFC is absolutely fine. I think Pizza Hut globally -- the division itself is underperforming and I have already detailed all the things that we are doing to get the business turned around and we expect much stronger year next year. We have a very good brand, the best brand we think in the category. And we've underperformed versus competition. And we think we will make significant progress next year. ", "Pat Grismer ", "And it also reminds you that we expect record level development globally with pizza brand and the vast majority of that will be done by franchisees.

Just two quick follow-ups. One, just on that topic of the value versus the premium. Just maybe you can give some color in terms of where the brand stands in terms of sales value versus premium. We often get that color in the U.S. but just - you talked about two years ago, the big value push versus today. Any kind of color in terms of how you mix value versus premium? And separately just the Taco Bell, just to clarify what you said earlier, I guess it's running still mid-single-digit breakfast. I think you had said longer-term you were pushing for high single digit. I'm just wondering how you gauge whether or not it's cannibalizing the lunch and dinner. It seems like the advertising dollars got shifted. But now as it shifts back, how do you get a good read that the consumer is now coming for breakfast and therefore not coming for lunch or dinner? Thanks.", "Pat Grismer ", "I'll address the Taco Bell question first, Jeffrey. And we look at a several different ways. But as we read the net list that we are getting in our breakfast day part which we define as sales before at 11 AM, we compare that to what we are getting before we nationally advertised and launched breakfast, we are seeing about five point lift which relative to the mix reinforces for us -- this is a highly incremental layer for us. We also look at the performance of the stores and this is a vast majority starts which offer breakfast versus -- today a small group, but [than] less meaningful group that doesn't offer breakfast and we see a dramatic difference in same store sales growth. Those data points reinforce our belief that what we are seeing here is a highly incremental layer. And we also believe that we have a good read on what drove the relatively soft performance balance of day as we talked about before with the media shift and the underperforming promotions.

Your line is open. ", "Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "", "Good morning. Just coming back to margins a little bit but from a different tack. So with what you guys have been able to achieve with KFC China in terms of driving margin efficiencies, you've been very good at detailing this in terms of sales forecasting, labor scheduling, reduced operating hours, things like that. I'm just curious what the opportunity is for you to pull some of those same levers as you look at some of these larger developed markets in the KFC division. So I recognize that those are 90%-plus franchise markets, but it just seems to me that there's a healthy opportunity at least on the operational side, to share some of those best practices with some of your bigger franchise groups out there.", "Pat Grismer", "Absolutely, Jeff. We are not pleased with the overall margins we are seeing for our KFC global brand division. Bear in mind working in that number would be -- some of our businesses in more developed market which are in the low end of the spectrum as it relates to margin performance. And then we have some businesses and they are in virgin market which benefit from relatively low labor and rent costs. That's not to say that we don't have an opportunity to deliver better results for both emerging and developed markets. And we are moving aggressively to share learnings around, how we can optimize food cost, optimize labor cost as you say, capitalize on the outstanding know how we have in China given the impressive results they have delivered. And make sure that we are leveraging that to achieve similar gains in our KFC global business. We also continue to look at opportunities we have to optimize our equity portfolio, earn-the-right to own philosophy and where we have equity businesses that are underperforming then we make those adjustments in order to optimize result for our shareholders. So really through a series of tactics leveraging know how we have in our organization and the good strong discipline we have around margin management. We are keen to improve those margins because we know there is an opportunity in our KFC global business. Helpful, Jeff?", "Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC", "", "I'm sorry. Real quick, if I could add just one more quick question just on the P&L. So any type of high-level, absolute dollar interest expense number you can roughly guide us to for 2014 as we think about that relative to 2013?", "Pat Grismer ", "I think we guide to about $10 million reduction because of refinancing we did last year, Jeff.", "Operator", "Last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar", "", "Thanks. Just a quick question about innovation on a broader level. I know you've been running a few fast-casual tests in the U.S., and just wanted to see broadly what is your plan for some of these smaller concepts? I know it's not a meaningful part of the business. But as you see longer-term -- you just testing for learning or just kind of - just probably get a sense of the fast-casual concepts start to pop up a little bit here and there, West Coast and Texas, just what the thoughts are behind those. Thanks.", "David Novak ", "We are testing some fast casual concepts primarily innovation labs where we can really learn more about what customers think about some of these products, some of these products we expect them coming to our base business or derivatives of them. If we have some learning that suggest that we have a bigger idea I guess we might start to think about a bigger. But it is more of a real focus on learning, more about the fast casual segment and using as incubator for what can go into the base business. So, we have got a Mexican concept, it has been opened up on the West Coast. We've got chicken small box format being tested in Dallas. And so we are looking at that. And we are also looking small box derivatives are offered to our base brand to give us more opportunities as well which we think probably is the biggest idea of all.", "Pat Grismer", "Thanks. R. J., just a modification response in the interest expense. So that should be similar to last year. So I think David that's our last question. ", "David Novak", "", "Well, thank you very much for being on the call. Let me summarize. We expect to have at least 20% EPS growth this year and will be better if we can obviously. The key points that I would like to leave you with is we are back on track with China with the better business model and better brand dynamics. We have three year payback with KFC, two year at Pizza and we are continuing to make significant progress with Pizza at Home Service. Number two, Taco Bell is successfully establishing breakfast. We believe that what we are doing at Taco Bell, how we are building the brand, the one-two combination of breakfast plus the innovation we have coming is going to continue to improve our unit economics and help us take Taco Bell from 5000 stores to 8000 stores. Our franchisees are in the breakfast program and in to it to win. Number three, KFC global is getting better and better around the world. And we expect continued success there. Pizza Hut next is major turnaround mode but we expect to go on to the 2015 very strong and benefit from the fact that we will be overlapping not so high this year and last but not least, one of our big engines at Yum! is new unit development. And we will have over 2000 new units opened in 2014. So we are very confident. We will get back to our ongoing growth model of delivering at least 10% earning per share growth on a sustainable basis. So thank you very much. Appreciate you being on the call.", "", "Operator", "", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands' Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Schmitt of Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy; you may begin your conference.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Melisa. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Novak, Chairman and CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. After remarks from David and Pat, we will be happy to take your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.", "In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum!

Investor event. Our 2014 New York Investor and Analysts Conference will be on Thursday, December 11, in Midtown, Manhattan. And our fourth quarter earnings release will be on Wednesday, February 4.", "With this, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. David Novak.", "David Novak", "", "Okay. Thanks, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Despite the recent supplier incident in China which has impacted China sales and reduced our full year EPS outlook, I am absolutely confident in Yum! Brands' ability to deliver strong, sustainable growth in the years ahead. And here is what, we fully expect China to fully recover. KFC Global is having a strong year and building momentum. Taco Bell has successfully and profitably introduced breakfast and is now expanding in the United States with new unit growth. And Pizza Hut Global should have a strong 2015 led by an expected US turnaround, which is in its early stages. ", "For the third quarter, earning per share increased 3% excluding special items. We clearly had unexpected negative sales in China and continued soft performance at our Pizza Hut Division. On the positive side, we delivered solid results at our KFC and Taco Bell Divisions, and have the benefit of overlapping a higher tax rate in the prior year. Importantly, our China sales are on the path to recovery and we expect a strong bounce back in 2015. ", "Now while it is clearly yesterday's newspaper, let me remind everyone that through the first half of the year, we are well on our way delivering on our objective of at least 20% full year EPS growth excluding special items. First half EPS growth of 27% was driven by particularly strong results in China, where system sales were 19% and we delivered restaurant margins of nearly 20%. However, our strong first half results have been offset by an unexpected and highly publicized food supplier incident in China, which significantly impacted sales at both KFC and Pizza Hut. As a result, we are now estimating full year EPS growth of 6% to 10% prior to special items. ", "Now I am sure you have a lot of questions about China. So let me get right to it. First here is what happened. On July 20, an undercover investigation was televised in China depicting alleged illegal actions by employees of Chinese food service supplier, Shanghai Husi, a division of OSI, which is a large and global food service supplier to many in the restaurant industry. To be clear, OSI was not a major supplier to Yum!, and represented only a small percentage of our sales at KFC and Pizza Hut in China. However, given our size and category leading positions in China, our sales were disproportionately impacted because we were mentioned with the same media weight as our major competitor, who was a large customer of OSI in China. ", "Also the fact that this followed the December, 2012, poultry incident at KFC clearly didn't help. Upon learning of the televised report, we terminated our relationship with OSI not only in China, but globally. We also began taking unprecedented measures to further strengthen our supply chain practices in China to prevent and identify fraudulent and deceptive behavior by suppliers going forward. For example, we are now requiring standards for suppliers in China to install closed-circuit televisions and implementation is underway. We are also establishing a whistleblower system to encourage suppliers' employees to report any potential food safety violations. ", "Unfortunately, no matter how many controls we have in place, it's extremely difficult to prevent a company from deceiving us if they resort to illegal activities. Nevertheless, we will learn from this incident and are committed to developing even better quality assurance processes as we move ahead. ", "Let me be clear, we expect all of our suppliers to follow the law and we are absolutely appalled with the alleged outrageous behavior of OSI. In fact, their actions are under investigation by the Chinese government, six employees have been arrested, and OSI has publicly admitted to wrong doing. We are waiting the final outcome of this government investigation, and I assure you we will pursue every legal recourse available to recover damages from this incident. ", "While we are doing everything we can to turn the situation around, what we need most right now is to get to time. As we've said before, experience tells us it take six to nine months to fully recover from this type of events, and this will most likely be the case with this situation as well. But make no mistake, KFC and Pizza are beloved brands in China and around the globe, and are proven to be absolutely resilient. We have complete confidence in a full sales recovery and expect our bounce back to be strong. ", "Now this is the quarter when we typically share some perspective on the upcoming year. So as we look towards 2015, China is obviously the key variable. I am sure you can imagine it's difficult to predict the exact shape of our bounce back in sales at this stage of the recovery process. However, sales are on the path to recovery and we expect a strong bounce back in 2015. Equally important, we firmly believe we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that would drive strong, sustainable growth in 2015 and beyond.", "Let me give you a little color on each of our divisions starting with China. As I said, obviously we have a short-term issue and we are weathering the storm. While primarily staying the course with our marketing plans, we supplemented this with the short quality assurance advertisement in August and communicated our action plan via social network. ", "Our consumer trust scores clearly dropped but our research indicates that we are on our way to rebuilding trust. At KFC China, we have over 4,600 restaurants in nearly 1,000 cities across the country, which is more than twice our nearest competitor. Going forward, we are continuing the roll out of our new restaurant design and introducing new digital technologies to contemporize the customer experience. Additionally, we expect to build up the most successful learnings of our KFC menu revamp and we are launching new group of products in the first half of 2015. Our goal is to present even better KFC our customers will appreciate and restore the stronger business model we had in the first half of the year.", "Even with our short-term sales issues, we still have the underlying economics that gives us confidence to keep investing in aggressive new unit expansion. Turning to Pizza Casual Dining, which is by far in a way the number one restaurant casual dining chain in China, and it has no major competitor. Pizza Hut continues to lead with menu innovation and everyday affordable value. In fact, 20% of Pizza Hut's menu is revamped twice a year with the most recent update occurring on September 29. ", "We are also continuing to leverage our assets by expanding our breakfast offering into more and more cities. With this new sales layer, our long-term goal is to create and own a mid scale casual dining breakfast occasion in China on a scale that matches what exists in the United States today. This is a huge opportunity and we are well positioned to capture it. ", "Today, we have nearly 1,200 restaurants in over 300 cities in China for Pizza Hut. We have a powerful economic model that generates fantastic new unit returns. So with strong underlying economics even in a temporary downturn, we continue to accelerate our new unit development of Pizza Casual Dining and plan to open over 250 units this year, further strengthening our category leading position. In fact, no other major casual dining chain in the world that we are aware of is growing units at such a rapid pace. Pizza Casual Dining is clearly a power brand with a great future. ", "Taking a step back, let me put KFC and Pizza brands in China into perspective. Basically today at KFC, we have restaurant margins of about 15% on depressed average unit volumes of $1.4 million. While these unit economics are strong, this compares to restaurant margins of 20% in average unit volumes of $1.7 million in 2011. There is no question in our minds; KFC will eventually get back to these sales and margin levels. Remember, McDonald's has average unit volumes of $2.5 million in the United States. We firmly believe we are still early on in our journey to leverage our asset base in KFC in China.", "Looking at Pizza Casual Dining, our average unit volumes have dipped slightly below $1.6 million, and we have restaurant margins of about 19%. This compares to average unit volumes of over $1.6 million and restaurant margins in excess of 20% just last year. Again, with breakfast, late night, continued innovation, a strong economic model and accelerating new unit development, we fully expect to get back to previous sales levels and more in the years ahead. ", "In addition to our opportunity to grow same -store sales and margin, the biggest opportunity we have in China is to penetrate the country with new stores. Yum! Currently has five restaurants per million people in China with a consuming class is expected to grow from 300 million people in 2012 to over 600 million people by 2020. This compares to or about 60 restaurants per million people in the United States where the consuming class is about 300 million people today. We continue to believe we'll openly have well over 20,000 restaurants across all of our concepts in China. ", "So in 2014, our new unit development target of at least 700 new unit stores remains unchanged. This means we will open over 1,400 new units in a two year period and we expect another strong year of development in 2015. All of which will provide substantial momentum for China Division as sales continue to recover. ", "Now let me share some perspective on our three global brands divisions starting with KFC. Our KFC Division which is our second largest profit contributor behind China continues to deliver solid sales and profit growth led by strong international performance. Importantly, our international new unit pipeline remains extremely robust. We expect to open at least 650 new KFC units outside of United States this year, and grow operating profit in this division consist with our full year guidance of more than 10%. ", "As you may know, we have nearly 40,000 restaurants in over a 110 countries around the world, 91% of which are franchised. We are especially pleased with our continue strength in emerging market led by high growth countries such as South Africa and Russia. Looking ahead, our new unit opportunities in emerging market are arguably the best in retail. With about two KFC restaurants per million people in emerging market, we know we have a long runway for growth. ", "Moving to our more developed KFC market, we have very solid businesses in Australia and UK and we are also pleased with the progress we are making in the United States. KFC is in strong shape and well positioned for 2015.", "At Pizza Hut, while we are disappointing with the full year operating profit and it will fall well short of our initial expectations, we are pleased with the progress we are making and expect us to continue in to next year. We sharpened our focus on value in the United States and have leveraged more competitive offers to drive digital activations. And consumers are responding. In fact, sales turned positive during the last few months of the quarter and our digital mix is now over 40% on our delivery in carryout business which represents more than five percentage point increase over second quarter. Our system is now fully aligned around competing more effectively and winning into digital and social world. You will see more evidence of this going forward.", "Looking ahead, we expect to build up this momentum with a launch of further initiatives to drive same-store sales growth beginning in the fourth quarter. Our plan is to launch new advertising positioning, design to better connect with millennials. We've recently had good success with our Hershey's dessert cookie and bacon and cheese stuffed crust pizza. We plan to reinforce Pizza Hut's leadership, quality, innovation and superior value as we continue to implement a comprehensive turnaround plan. ", "Globally, we are sharing best practices to drive sales growth and we are making focus to investments to accelerate our pace of new unit development, especially across the delivery and express channel. We expect to open a record 450 new international units this year for Pizza Hut and are counting on this number to grow significantly in the years ahead. ", "Turning to Taco Bell. We are definitely well positioned to deliver on our expectation for a strong second half. During the quarter, we delivered same store sales growth of 3%, clearly outpacing the QSR category. Importantly, breakfast sales are sustaining with the 6% day part mix without the benefit of high launched level media weight. I would go so far as to say we are one of the very few companies in the history of the QSR industry to launch breakfast successfully and profitably in year one. Not only our breakfast sales largely incremental, but we are making money and sustaining it with margins of nearly 21% in the quarter. Without question, we now have a great platform to grow from. Remember, McDonald's breakfast day part is 25%. So this gives us an opportunity to grow on that day part for many years ahead. ", "Going forward, we will introduce mobile ordering and payments in the fourth quarter and we have significant innovation plan in our core business to drive growth, balance of the year and beyond. With strong unit level of economics at Taco Bell, we are seeing an acceleration of development with over 100 net new units this year which represents a 10 year high. And we have even better development pipeline headed into 2015. We are confident we will ultimately achieve our goal of at least 8,000 Taco Bell restaurants in the United States. ", "Finally, we are investing for the long-term and develop the great brands in India which will drive substantial future growth for Yum! KFC will be bigger in units than McDonald by the end of the year, Pizza Hut sales of deliver unit economies are getting stronger and more competitive with Dominos. And at Taco Bell, early results are encouraging with plans for accelerating the pace of development. ", "Now to sum things up, in spite of our short-term issue in China, the fundamentals of Yum!'s growth model remains extremely compelling. As you know, there are three keys to driving shareholder value in retail. New unit development, same store sales growth and generating high returns. In terms of development, our new unit opportunity in emerging markets including China remains the best in retail and our opportunity to expand is huge. We have three iconic brands and while we have about 60 restaurants per million people in the United States today, we only have two restaurants per million people in the Top 10 emerging markets including China and India. This is a long runway for international growth and gives us tremendous confidence in our ability to continue our aggressive expansion for many years to come. We also see significant opportunity to grow units at Taco Bell in the United States and make it a truly global brand. ", "Furthermore, we have over 40,000 restaurants around the world that have significant capacity to grow. And as I said, we are building momentum behind major initiatives around the world that would drive same- store sales growth in 2015 and beyond. Remember, in China, average unit volumes are well below where they were two years ago, and we expect to get back to these levels in more over time. We are making KFC even more contemporary, have huge upside at breakfast delivery and late night and are building off of our best operations in the world. ", "At Pizza Casual Dining in China, we will continue to grow the core with constant innovation while we grow the breakfast and late night day part. At our KFC Division, we are sharing know how and getting better at advertising, innovation, value day part expansion mention and digital, which we expect will result in higher sales growth in the years ahead. We are particularly pleased with our progress in breakfast in Asia. The initial results of expanding our happy afternoon hour, through our learnings from Taco Bell, and the beginning of the US turnaround at KFC.", "At Taco Bell, our breakfast day part is now established and already profitable. What's more, our dollar cravings menu is resonating, product and digital pipeline is full and ready for 2015.", "And finally at Pizza Hut, we are making significant progress on the digital front and have a comprehensive turnaround plan now in place at our US business that we will expand globally. Additionally, we will be overlapping 2014 results which will give us the short-term boost in 2015. Meanwhile, our returns on invested capital are consistently been among the best in the retail industry. Over 90% of our restaurant outside of China are owned and operated by franchisees. We love the franchise model which will generate about $2 billion in franchisees in 2014. These franchisees provide us with a large, reliable and growing stream of cash, which combined with the profit from equity stores, enables us to invest in high return growth opportunities and return significant cash to our shareholders.", "So let me wrap things up for Yum! brands. At our three global divisions, KFC continues to be delivering solid results, we are making solid progress at Pizza Hut and we are pleased Taco Bell is delivering on our expectations for a much stronger second half. We had an unexpected issue in China, but we fully expect to be on the path to a full sales recovery and continued aggressive growth in the years ahead.", "Now let me hand it over to Pat Grismer, our CFO.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover three areas. Our third quarter result; our revised outlook for the full year and our capital allocation philosophy. For the third quarter, I'll highlight some key aspects of financial performance to add further dimension to our reported results.", "Starting with China. David outlined why our same -store sales declined 14% in the quarter. So I'll explain how this impacted our restaurant margin which came in at 14.9% or 4.6 percentage point below prior year. First, same-stores transaction declined 17% which not only significantly de-leveraged our fixed cost but also made it difficult for our teams to manage restaurant level expenses, leading to inefficiencies in food and labor. Combined these issues to over negative margin impact of about six percentage point. Rollover pricing actions provided approximately four points of margin benefit but half of this offset by 10% labor inflation. Restaurant margins were also negatively affected by inventory write- off related to the disposable of OSI products. Collectively, these items account for the roughly five point margin decline for the quarter. ", "Clearly, had it not been for the de-leverage and inefficiencies triggered by the OSI incident, we would have reported restaurant margins of over 20% for the quarter. We are confident that as we rebuild sales in China, margins will rebound as well. One of the thing I would like to point out about China's third quarter results, we continue to shift our new unit development program to a higher return investments. For example, year-to-date to Q3, 67% of KFC China development was in Tier 3 through six cities compared to 53% in 2012. Similarly, 36% of total China development with Pizza Hut Casual Dining compared to 23% in 2012. Over time this evolution of our development program will enhance portfolio margins and returns. ", "Now moving to our Global KFC Division which posted its best quarter of the year with solid improvements in sales, margins and profit. System sales throughout was especially strong in emerging market, up 12% led by Russia, Thailand and Africa. International developed market also delivered solid system sales growth, up 6% led by the UK, Continental Europe and Australia. Profits grew an impressive 14% before the impact of foreign exchange, excluding a two point benefit from the overlap of franchise convention expenses. This compares to 8% profit growth in the first half of the year and demonstrates the strong momentum that we see in this business across both emerging and developed markets including our KFC US business which delivered 2% same-store sales growth in the quarter. ", "Our Global Pizza Hut Division also posted its best quarter of the year, although still well below our ongoing expectations. While total same-store sales declined 1%, our US business which represents more than half the division's profit, actually turned same-store sales positive in the second half of the quarter. Despite this improving trend, operating profits declined 6% excluding a four point benefit from the overlap of franchise convention expenses. We are obviously not happy with these results. However, comparing this to the 17% profit decline we recorded for the first half of the year, it's clear that many of the turnaround efforts launched earlier this year including the digital initiatives which David mentioned, are beginning to have impact and are providing upward momentum in advance of a new brand advertising campaign in the US. ", "And finally for Taco Bell. Again, their best quarter of the year. We've long said that Taco Bell in 2014 would be a first half, second half story from a profit, growth perspective. And the division's third quarter result certainly bares this out. Profits grew 14% compared to a 9% decline in the first half of the year. Importantly, restaurant margins swung from a 2.6 percentage point decline in the first of the year to 1.8 percentage point gain in the third quarter as targeted pricing actions and restaurants cost savings more than offset food inflation, which is unexpectedly escalated significantly over the past several months. ", "Additionally, we are on pace to open nearly 200 new stores this year. Our strongest rate of development in more than a decade. Over 80% of these new restaurants will be franchised demonstrating the brand's attractive unit economics. ", "The last financial highlight, I would like to draw your attention too is tax. Since the second quarter of 2010, we've disclosed in our SEC filings a dispute with the IRS regarding the valuation of intangible assets. I am pleased to report that we've resolved this matter in the third quarter. In conjunction with this, we made an initial cash payment to the IRS of $120 million, which was effectively fully reserved. Remaining cash payments due under the terms of our agreement are also fully reserved. In the aggregate, these additional payments are expected to be less than the amount we paid in Q3. Including adjustments related to this settlement, our third quarter effective tax rate was nearly 11 point lower than prior year as we lapped an incremental tax reserves that we recorded in 2013. We are pleased to put this matter behind us.", "I would now like to shift gears and talk about our full year outlook. In China, sales remained difficult to call, however, based on current trends and expected recovery period of six to nine months, and the knowledge that this recoveries are rarely linear, we expect same-store sales to be negative for the fourth quarter. This is obviously disappointing, but I can assure that the team is working very hard to restore consumer trust, accelerate the sales recovery and rebuild margins responsibly. Importantly, we are continuing to build new restaurants and expect to open 700 new stores this year. Although, the current sales declines have dampened our new unit returns, these returns on average still exceed our internal hurdle rates. And because we expect sales will full recover, we are confident that our restaurant expansion program is not only extending our competitive lead, but is also creating shareholder value over the long term. ", "Keep in mind; KFC and Pizza Hut are the leading brands in China with enviable competitive advantages. No other retailer has the scale, the development expertise, the advertising clout, the supply chain infrastructure or the people capability that we do in China. We believe that with the benefit of long-term macro tailwinds, the restaurant category in China will grow significantly over the long run and we are better positioned than anyone else to capitalize on this opportunity.", "Outside of China, third quarter results at KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are indicative of the momentum that we expect will deliver on our promise of second half results that are substantially better than what we delivered in the first half of the year. Trends are clearly moving in the right direction. ", "Now when you added all up and include our updated 2014 tax rate of approximately 25% to 26%, we estimate full year EPS growth to be between 6% and 10% versus prior year excluding special items. As you would expect, the single greatest variable in this equation in China sale, which I said earlier, remain very difficult to predict. This recovery, combined with the fact that the OSI incident occurred in the middle of our peak summer seasons, figures very heavily in our full year results. We will provide an update on our 2014 outlook as well as 2015 at our Annual Investor meeting in December. ", "Now, I would like to discuss our capital allocation philosophy. Our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Year-to-date, we've generated EBITDA of over $2 billion versus $1.9 billion in the same period last year. And importantly, we remained disciplined in how we use this cash. We concentrate our investments in high growth, high return businesses. And we re-franchise when we believe the franchise model creates more shareholder value. We have a good track record of doing this and this will continue. In fact, we've begun to re-franchise a portion of our equity position in Western Europe, where margins and returns have lagged our expectations. Additionally, as KFC restaurants in higher tier cities in China trend toward lower margin, we expect the franchise mix of these restaurants to increase gradually over time. We also have a good track record of returning all available cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. For example, over the last five years, we've repurchased 57 million shares representing 12% reduction in outstanding shares. And I am sure you read our recent announcement of 11% dividend increase. This marks the 10th consecutive year we increased our dividend at a double digit rate, one of only 12 companies in the S&P 500 to do so. With this latest increase, we also raised our dividend payout target to 40% to 45% of annual net income before special items. Our resulting dividend yield of about 2% compares very favorably to other companies with the similar growth profile. ", "So when you consider the growth opportunity we have with our brand and the cash we return to our investors, we believe our company is set up to provide a compelling total shareholder return over the long run. ", "So let me wrap things up. We are urgently working to overcome the temporary, negative impact that the China supplier publicity has had on our business. We are confident that we will bounce back in China and regain the momentum we saw in the first half of 2014. This combined with the momentum we are building outside of China, positioned us for an impressive 2015. Most importantly, we believe our double digit growth model will endure for many years to come. ", "And with that I'll hand things back over to David. ", "David Novak", "", "Okay. Thanks, Pat. We are reading to take questions but before I do, I want to point out that this will be my last earnings call as CEO, and the Greg Creed will be the CEO beginning January 1, which time I will assume my new role as Yum!'s Executive Chairman of the Board. We've been working on seamless transition together and I couldn't be more pleased to have a leader of great stature taking the helm. I have worked with Greg for over 17 years, he lives and drives our culture, he knows all aspects of the business call, he has worked on every brand, and he has been Yum!'s chief operating officer in the past, he has a great brand builder and what he has done at Taco Bell, I think has been absolutely sensational. The Board and I are absolutely convinced that he is just the guy to take the company to the next level. Greg will join me and take a lead at our December Investor Conference in New York. And with that, we are happy to take any questions that you may have. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "(Operator Instructions)", "Your first question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning. And first David, congratulations on your great run as CEO of Yum!, and good luck with your transition upcoming. My first question is really related to the China trends. And I know you mentioned the trends are starting to stabilize or improve there. I am just wondering if you could give a little bit more context on how deep some of the same-store sales declines were initially and perhaps what you are seeing more recently? And then related to that, what level of decline are you embedding in your fourth quarter outlook? ", "Pat Grismer", "Hi, David. I am certainly not going to provide specific numbers around what happened in any given month, but happy to speak to overall trends. Now first let me remind you, we had a very strong first half of the year where same-store sales were up 12%, demonstrating the strength and resilience of our brands. So even as we've been impacted here in the last quarter, we expect our brands to bounce back strongly. We remained very confident that we will see a recovery in what we estimated a six to nine months period because we saw in the month of September that sales were substantially better than they were in the month of August which was the month immediately following the publicity incident. So we are clearly recovering. We are also seeing consumer scores improving and that further reinforces our belief in this recovery. But remember, we are in the very early stages of this recovery cycle, so it's appropriate to be a bit more conscious at this stage when we are guiding sales. And we also know from our past experience that these recoveries are rarely linear. The other thing I\u2019d point out is that China's hardest same-store sales overlap this year is in the fourth quarter. So when you add all of those things together, our best estimate today, again based on current trends that we see in the business, is the same-store sales will be negative over the fourth quarter which as a reminder spans the months of September through December. But make no mistake, we expect sales to continue to improve across the quarter and again history tells us that our brands are resilient and we will be prepared to provide more color and context on this at our Investor Conference in December.", "David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird", "Great, thank you. And then maybe second and relatedly, is there any more color that you could share on what actions you are taking to restore trust with consumers? I know you mentioned the quality assurance campaign that you ran, but is there anything that you can share about what you are doing currently or planning to do for the rest of the quarter to restore the trends there? ", "David Novak ", "I think David, we basically have announced all of our action plans to continue to make our supply chain even stronger, and unprecedented things that we are doing to work with our suppliers. That's all been publicized. We had a quality assurance advertising campaign that was very brief, just lucky for now that we are clearly addressing the issue and that our food is safe to eat, which it absolutely is and has been and always has been. So that's what we've done. Right now, we are in the midst of just running our basic marketing programs that we've had. We are currently doing promotions around our rice based products, rice and chicken based products, and we are basically waiting for the business to come back. Like I said, the biggest thing we need is to give the time and that's exactly what we are doing as we are aggressively marketing the brand and hoping that time takes its course and which we are very confident the business will come back. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "Hi, thanks, and I will add my congratulations, David, I think by my calculation, you probably suffered our questions for 70 conference calls non stop. So I will lob in one more. Can you compare the rate of improvement in China sales this incident versus the prior? I think last time you lost some family business over concerns. So are consumers responding differently? Is there different kind of product mix? And also can you just map out the rate of improvement versus the prior incident in December of 2012?", "Pat Grismer", "John, as you know, two crises are ever the same. However, as we step back and look at how sales and consumers scores are trended in the two months or so since the incident, I would say that the trend is broadly in line with what we saw the last time, but again we are relatively early in the stage of this recovery and we continue to believe that we will see a full recovery in a six to nine months timeframe. ", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley ", "Okay and then Pat, you had indicated sort of the breakdown of margins which was helpful. What in your mind was truly one time and maybe didn't do the math quick enough. You talked about some inventory or food waste. Can you just talk about what you thought was really discrete to the third quarter and what was just sales de-levering? And in the past you have been very good about moderating labor. Have you been even better and faster this incidence? Are you able to correct going forward at a more rapid clip correct labor scheduling to benefit margins going forward?", "Pat Grismer ", "Well, John, I would clearly characterize the extreme sales de-leverage as a one time event and this is not something that we would expect would happen regularly. And the impact to our business was quite severe just given how sharp and sudden the transaction decline was. And our teams did the best they could to respond to that situation. You know you never want to pull out labor too quickly because you don't know how consumer traffic is going to trend. And we want to make sure that the consumers who are coming to our brands are having a very good experience. Yes, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there were some inventory write-off that were quite substantial that translated into over half point of drag in our margins for the period just related to the product from OSI. So again I think that it was the transaction de-leverage that clearly was the big driver. And I would characterize that as a one time event. Again, have it not been for all the effects we saw of the OSI incident to our margins; we would have posted a margin and quarter of over 20%. And I think that's the better indication of how we are thinking about our business model longer term and what we are striving to get back as quickly as possible.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital. Your line is open. ", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. And congrats, David. Two real general investor concerns that we hear about and it might be too broad to comment today, maybe let say for the December Analyst day. And the first is that KFC and Pizza Hut brands in China are somehow impaired due to the result of multiple incidents happening. Are you seeing lower lows and some of these scores in a way that implies to you that these brands are getting hit harder and deeper with each of these incidents? And second, there is a concern that your some thread that connects these incidents, even though they don't seemed linked, maybe it's the fact the press is more active or there is an underline distrust at the food supply chain broadly in China but this implies that Yum! China has a higher risk of sales shocks going forward as well. Could you comment on those two concerns? ", "David Novak ", "I think the first one the research trends that we see are basically similar, so we haven't seen anything move one way or the other return. In terms of the impact in the future-- I can only tell you that we monitor and respond to social media 24x7 and we actually responded quickly this last time around and the sentiment turned positive a lot faster this time around. We really can't predict future. I would never be one to say that we could never have any incident like this again. And but I can tell you we get stronger from everything that we had-- ever happens like this we get lot stronger and stronger from -- we improve our processes that are already strong. Everything we can do to learn from and get better. We are really confident that the China is going to be a continue growth vehicle for us. We got 300 million people today going to 600 million people by 2020. This consuming class is going to grow, our brand are clearly the leading brands in China. Even as we take short-term sales process, our margins are still very good. We have very good business model as we go forward. I think what we've proven over time is that we are resilient enough and strong enough to weather storms like this. Now, hopefully we won't have another incident like this for a long time to come. Believe me, we are doing everything we can to make sure that-- sure that we don't.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. ", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital ", "Great, thank you very much. David, congratulations.", "I've got two for you. One, just specific to the China unit growth, you talk about this year being another year of that 700 plus. Just wondering whether anything that has happened over the past few months or perhaps the past couple of years leads you to change that view and we should think something materially different as we look to 2015, whether it is by brand or by tier or whether we are full speed ahead in terms of 700 plus for the next few years? And then the other question is just in your prepared remarks you talked about China and being obviously a very high growth company operated business model. The rest of the world needless to say is more franchise and slower growth. Are there any updated thoughts on whether you would ever consider separating the China business? It just seems like you are running two different tracks and they might be greater appreciation for people who would like to invest in one or the other but rather not both. Thanks.", "David Novak ", "We believe in our business model, it has served us well in the past, we think it's going to service well in the future. We think what we have right now is not a structural issue. We think we have a short term brand issue that we have to deal with. And our challenge is to -- in China is basically to recover and grow. That's 100% of our focus and a lot and I guess I have to rephrase it. I guess like 1000% of the focus that we have. The single biggest thing we can do for our shareholders right now is to put every inch of muscle, fiber, whatever you want to call it and turn this business around and get it back where we really know it's capable. And that's our focus. One thing I would tell every shareholder is that we always have a right to own philosophy. You have to earn the right to own. 90% of our business outside of China is franchise which I think you point out very well. China is primarily our equity business is where we put our capital end. And that's because we have great returns on invested capital and we've had cash on cash returns in three to five years. We expect that to be the same as we go forward. We think that will serve our shareholders very well. And we have that earn to right to own mentality and that's going to guide our thinking our structure as we go ahead. ", "Pat Grismer", "And Jeffrey to respond your first question around the pace of development. We have no reason at this stage to back off our commitment to continue to aggressive development. We will however continue to evolve our development program to pivot towards the higher margin, higher return opportunities as we have done for the last couple of years, increasing the weight of KFC new units in lower tier cities and increasing the weight of Pizza Casual Dining restaurant which again offers superior economics. But we remain bullish on the long-term growth opportunity in China. And we believe that we have the very solid business model that is currently under short-term pressure but it is going to bounce back and bounce back strongly. And provide the returns necessary to sustain the high rate of development. ", "David Novak ", "Greg and I are heading towards China in a couple of weeks. We are going to have the annual operating plan. We are going to hear what the team has to say. We have a very focused new unit tracking systems, where we look at returns and monitor returns on a quarterly basis and see other doing versus our internal rates of returns or CapEx requirements. We will sit down, we will have very, very discussion on that, with the shareholders remind that we have nothing to believe other than the fact that we continue our strong rate of development basis on what we know today. And I don't anticipate any new revelations. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open. ", "Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets", "Thanks and in addition to you David, please pass the congratulations on to Greg and look forward to giving him some hard questions going forward.", "David Novak ", "He is capable handler.", "Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets", "I can't imagine how frustrating this has been especially post restaging the KFC brand earlier this year. But you talked about staying the course, hunkering down, sticking to the basic motions. Just wondering, can you talk a little bit about that decision weighing that approach versus say going and buying back some traffic, getting people back in, reminding them how good the experience is. How do you think about those two approaches? If you could give us some color there that would be great. Thanks.", "David Novak ", "Well, first of all, we are working on marketing right now that really gets to exactly what you are talking about. Reminding people of the role that KFC plays in their life, the good time spent you had in the past, the good time you can have today and that we are contemporary and we are on the money in terms of what you are looking for in China as China ever change, so the marketing direction that we are taking I think is very similar to what you're suggesting that we do. When you look at value, value is a very important component of the basic quick service restaurant industry. We've got very good entry pricing today. We will have promotions as we go forward that will entice trial back into the business. We will -- we will be looking for massive retrial of the brands over time. And right now for example we are offering free drinks at KFC. So whether that's put into the right context now to get everybody in the country to come back tomorrow, I am not going to say that. But we are offering free drinks with a soup or rice from --rice purchases at this stage. So I think we are pretty aligned with the fact that retrial and getting last year's backend is clearly the goal and that's what we will be talking about at the KFC team.", "Keith Siegner - UBS Capital Markets", "Thanks, David. Pat, can I sneak in one real quickly? Just in terms of the margins to follow-up a little bit, are you seeing any major changes, like where is COGS inflation, how do we think about that? Also it is rare to see occupancy dollars down in that China business year-over-year. Was there anything one time that hit that line item as well? Thanks. ", "Pat Grismer ", "Nothing one time on the occupancy line but also in that category however would be rent large portion something, vast majority of our leases have variable component. So if sales come down and so do rent and so that was account for decline in absolute level of rent expense which fall for the occupancy other line. With respect to COGS sales, that's an area that's going to put a bit pressure on margins in the fourth quarter because we had three straight quarters now flat commodity cost in China, and we are expecting fourth quarter to show 3% food cost inflation. ", "David Novak ", "Thank you. Just one more point to that. Keep in mind that our advertising is also flat percentage of sales, so as sales come down that line will also be reduced. So thanks Keith. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley with BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ", "Joe Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I wish you the best. A question on the China sales cadence again. I realize you expect improvement sequentially but because this incident was a second half incident I'm imagining the first half, second half performance in China was like dramatically different. So maybe to put it in some perspective, do you think the fourth quarter will be down less than the 14% full quarter decline in the third quarter?", "Pat Grismer", "Again, Joe, given we are at in the recovery process, we are not going to be any more precise and how we guide same-store sales. We do expect an improving trend consistent with our past experience. And we anticipate full recovery within a six to nine months period. And it just isn't appropriate I think at this stage to be any more specific or precise than that. ", "David Novak ", "We will know more Joe in December. Joe, we don't know, we don't know. And we will know more in December and we will update you in December with all the color that we have to provide you on that.", "Joe Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Can I switch gears for a moment and ask one on Taco Bell. The 3% comp I think you mentioned a couple of points of price and a 6% breakfast mix. So doesn't that add up to the lunch dinner business being down pretty significantly at Taco Bell?", "Pat Grismer", "Well, there is no doubt that other day part are under pressure, consistent with what we are observing across the entire QSR category in the US. We feel very good about how the breakfast layer has added incremental sales to our business and has helped us to deliver same-store sales growth in the tough environment.", "David Novak", "I think the big thing is our margins were 21% when we launch breakfast. To me we are in different where these sales count. The great thing for us next year 4% or 5%, I don't care if they come from breakfast, late night, lunch, dinner, whatever. I don't care where they come from. We just need them. And what we have now as we have a lot more muscle in the KFC, in the Taco Bell box to go out and get those sales. I love the fact that we got 6% mix of breakfast and our margins are 21% and we know that McDonald has 25% of their business from breakfast. And it killed me for years driving by all those McDonald's that are full and before we even open up our doors. So I think this is like just taking our awareness and taking our usage of breakfast up over time is like the biggest new product we could ever introduce to grow the base business. And that the trade-off, the margin trade-off between lunch and dinner aren't that significant for us. So we are able to leverage the box and that's the name of the game. And when we talk to our franchises, one of the reasons why we really believe so much in breakfast as we thought this was essential for us so we would have more growth options as we go forward in the future. So I think it's just early days if you look at breakfast. Everybody thinks Taco Bell has a great late night business. Fourth meal, our Sunday, Monday, Tuesday breakfast is higher than our late night business. So we got -- we are building a pretty damn good business that's only getting better as we go forward. I am glad, Joe, that we have it in our arsenal. Now, we also launch a dollar craving menu which is being very well received. We launched that recently which we really pulls our value story. The thing about this is that these dollar cravings products are actually products that people crave, and they are really good value for a dollar. And so we think that's going to be a good one. And the other thing that we feel good about with Taco Bell, we are breaking new ground with mobile and digital and our social work is I think best practice not only our industry but for any consumer good as we go forward. So there is a lot of good news. I think the best barometer about breakfast is our franchisees are saying, stay on it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. ", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Thank you. So I actually wanted to ask about the China growth story as well which is opening 700 new units but actually the net growth looks a lot lower than that. So I guess the two questions are one is, ultimately I think that is what we care about when we are trying to figure out revenue growth is kind of net unit growth. And then also, is there any kind of mix shift going on there and is that what might have shown up in your occupancy cost, more closures in Tier 1 and 2 higher costs markets? And then I will have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Okay. Thank you, Sara. First on the net units. Yes, we are concerned about net units. So it's not just a matter of gross but also looking at the closures. In fact, in closures there was a bigger story which was that disproportionate share of those closure were Little Sheep unit. So not reflection of the overall strength of our business model and the development opportunity with KFC and Pizza Hut. ", "Sara Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay, great. And then the follow-up was you said that you responded more quickly as time sentiment turned around more quickly on the China scandal and yet still expecting kind of the same six- to nine-month recovery period. So could you just talk a little bit about that? I know in the past, David, has said accurately that really time is your best friend but just this idea that you learned a lot from last time, you handled it potentially better this time and yet the cadence of the recovery is pretty much the same.", "David Novak", "", "Well, I think that what we've learned is that no matter how much we love our brands and we do, I mean we love our brands beyond belief in our company, we have learned instead consumers have lots of options. They do not have to use us every single day and they can figure out when they want to come back. And what we've learned over time it really doesn't matter even almost a big, the issue there if there is a highly publicized event, it takes six to nine months to recover. Just because consumers are cautious when it comes to food intake. And I want to point out nobody was ill because of this, nobody-- no real tangible personal issue that took place because of this other than the fact that we were tainted by this. And it takes time and it was highly publicized and this one was really tough to take, okay. Because this was here we are going the safety behavior that we -- there is no process in the world I think it could overcome. And the fact of the matter is when I watched that CCTV event and I saw the coverage, you had McDonald's, Pizza Hut and KFC, mentioned in absolute equal amount and I would say it would be hard to argue that we might not --we thought they are more mentioned, okay. And it was like when I saw that I said oh, here comes six to nine months a problem that I was not at all surprised by this, okay. So I think that's just what we have learned. We have always said that with our business, we have a great business model. We have great brands, that we have the single biggest risk we have in our business is when we have any publicity around food safety issues. And now that's exacerbated with social media. We are getting better at responding to social media, but it's still out there. So if one of those issues that we are just going to have to deal with and hopefully we won't have future event.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ", "Amod Gautam - JPMorgan", "Hi, thanks, it's Amod Gautam filling in and on behalf of John as well, congrats, David. The question was on productivity, could you remind us of when the productivity initiatives were put into place at KFC in China? And then secondly, where does that fall in terms of the priorities of the China team, where do they tell you they are in terms of margin initiatives whether food, waste or labor scheduling? Is there still an opportunity there?", "Pat Grismer", "You may recall last year we started to see significant productivity gains in the third quarter. So and the third quarter of this year we lapped those productivity gain and actually we added to them a bit. So the team remains very focused on sustaining those initiatives to drive higher levels of labor productivity. It remains a priority for them to continue to drive margins back to a level that they were couple of years ago. So even as we look to recover some sales pressure that team is not taking their eye off of the continued opportunity to drive high rates of labor efficiency. As a step going forward as we introduced newer technologies back of house that will provide next leg of opportunity on labor productivity.", "Amod Gautam - JPMorgan", "And if I could just add, how soon might that happen, the back of house technologies?", "Pat Grismer", "Probably in the next couple of years, next month.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open. ", "R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar ", "Thanks. I had a question about the reach of the food suppliers' publicity in China. More specifically were there any noticeable differences in the same store sales results and the higher tier cities versus the lower tier cities and does the shift you have gone to over the last couple of quarters more towards lower tier cities helping the overall recovery and what I mean over the next couple of quarters?", "Pat Grismer", "We didn't see any meaningful differences in same-store sales performance or they impacted the publicity across city tiers for either brand. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open. ", "Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited", "Good morning. I wanted to ask about your point, David, about the competitor set. So obviously you were mentioned, Pizza Hut, KFC, McDonald's, local brands were sort of swept up into this OSI issue as well. Can you just talk about your dialogue with the consumer, what you are seeing maybe in terms of your market share? Did they trade out into local brands; did they trade away from fast food in general? Just any color around your brand versus the competitive set would be very helpful. Thank you.", "David Novak ", "Okay. We have not been able to do a source of business study, okay that where we can really crack where people are going. So maybe the China team will have more color on that and we meet with them in the next couple of weeks. Be happy to share that with you when we have it. ", "Diane Geissler - CLSA Limited", "", "Okay, great, thank you. ", "David Novak", "Okay. I want to thank everyone for being on the call. There is no absolutely no question that we have a taken a tough blow but we performed well in adverse situation in the past and I am absolutely confident we will fully recover in China. And we will deliver strong sustainable growth in years ahead. As I hope we conveyed on the call, we are very confident about the future and Yum! is definitely well positioned to deliver on the three things we know drives shareholder value. The new unit growth, the same-store sales growth and the high returns which we are ever mindful of all three of these key dimensions of our business. I want to thank all of you for the nice congratulation. It has been a great joy and a great honor to be the CEO of this company.

I'm pleased that you could all join on my first earnings call and I'm honored to share with you the opportunities ahead Yum! as well a review of our results. Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at the Investor Day in December. Our goal is to continue to build free global iconic brand that people trust and champion. I believe that's critical to delivering sustained growth and I'll share some views during my comments about 2015. ", "But before I do, I'd like to comment on our 2014 results. As you saw in our release last evening, we grew full year EPS 4% in 2014, despite a 29% decline in the fourth quarter. These results were heavily skewed by the challenges handled in our biggest division, as we suffered two highly publicized supplier incidents in two consecutive years in China. However, we continue to believe this setback is temporary as evidenced by the bounce back we delivered in the first half of 2014 following the first supplier incident. As prudent of our convictions, we continue to invest what our belief is. We are building 700 new units in China this year because we absolutely believe that market offers strong unit economics and return on investment. Based on our expected recovery in China and the positive momentum across the rest of Yum!, we expect EPS growth of at least 10% in 2015. ", "As outlined at our Investor Conference in New York, this will be a first half second half story with EPS growth negative in the first half of the year then turning strongly positive in the back half of the year. I'd like to reiterate that we are firmly committed to restoring our track record of at least 10% EPS growth and consistently achieving our division targets. So how are we going to do this? Well today I'd first like to update you on what's happening in China since we last met in December. I will then discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our business and after that Pat will walk you through the financials.", "First China, following the successful menu revamp in 2014, China operating profit increased 116% in the first half of the year and Yum! EPS grew 27%. We were convinced that 2014 would be a year of at least 20% EPS growth. The Shanghai Husi supplier incident changed all of that. We know KFC and Pizza Hut are beloved brands in China with a huge advantage not just in scale but also innovation, quality and people capability, despite the recovery of KFC is not occurring at the pace we expected. The good news is that our consumer perception scores have shown continued improvement. Metrics at KFC including food safety scores and reliable brand scores have improved every month since their August lows. From what we can tell, the biggest setback to this recovery is that we incurred two supplier incidents in such a short timeframe. ", "So what are we doing to address this? We've learnt from other setback that we must innovate our layout and that's what we're doing. We have two menu revamps scheduled this year one in the first half and one in the second half. This proves successful in the first half of 2014 and we'll leverage the success this year. And of course we'll continue to offer compelling value. We've also started our initial rollout of premium coffee in Shanghai KFC stores in December.", "The initial results are encouraging and firstly ground copy has contributed probably to our breakfast and afternoon data. We expect this to add an incremental sales way that we can grow. By the end of February we have copy in more than a thousand of app stores and by the end of the year we anticipated we should have copy rolled out into over 2000 stores. This is a significant achievement and stepping a different way we'll have premium copy in more stores by the end of the year then Starbucks had total stores in China in 2014. I want to assure you it's my top priority and all hands are on deck to get the China business back on track as soon as possible. Prior to our investor meeting in December Joey Wat, our KFC China President spent several days in Irvine working with the Taco Bell team to learn more about Taco Bell innovation process mobile app and digital customer engagement. Jolly has taken those learning and is looking to improve KFC China in these areas. ", "This is just one example of have we share now have and best practices from teams around the world as we address the set back with a sense of urgency. Now let's step back and look at where we are KFC China averaging volumes in 2014 where 1.35 million or 20% off at peak levels but despite these margins held at 15%. These fundamentals demonstrate we can still open stores with confidence offering attractive returns for our shareholders. We know still have work to do to regain our customers trust but once we do the opportunity are tremendous. Just recovering average unit volumes to 2012 levels to KFC will result in $1.7 billion incremental revenue and that doesn\u2019t even include the new units we\u2019re building. Pizza Hut Casual Dining is recovering more quickly the brand was not as severely impacted by the supplier event as KFC. Many consumer metrics are back to process where they were in the second quarter of 2014. And we introduced this to the fact of Pizza Hut has only been impacted by one supply instrument not two by no means are we out the woods but we are trending in the right direction. And we are continuing to build the brand by expanding style layers like breakfast in late night.", "I want to assure you that we remain committed to new unit development and plan to open 700 new units in China in 2015 which builds under 737 we open in 2014. In addition to the massive new unit opportunities have been KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining, we continue to expand Pizza Hut Home Service as well. We have a tremendous sales leverage opportunity in China as sales recover and we fully expect to realize this overtime. There\u2019s a $600 million profit opportunity by simply returning our existing assets to the volumes we had in 2012. And I have great confidence in Sam Su, our Vice Chairman and China division CEO and his ability to get the China business back on track and capture this enormous upside. ", "Now for the other two thirds of our business. First KFC, our KFC business model is incredibly strong I love the combination of being the emerging market leader being franchise led and having allotments like double digit operating growth well into the future. We expect to open 700 new international units in 2015 after a record year in 2014 of 666 new units. We're clearly entering the year with same stores sales momentum as comps grew 4% in our last quarter.", "We saw continued excellent system sales right in Russia of nearly 40% and double digit growth in Africa and Thailand all in constant currency. The new use to KFC is our U.S businesses performing much better. U.S same stores sales grew 6% in the fourth quarter and the division is poised with best year in sometime. All of this sets the KFC division after a strong 2015 Micky Pant our KFC CEO is there is lot of credit leading this incredible brand and with this brand positioning is always original I am confident the best is yet to come. ", "Now to Pizza Hut, we opened a record 465 new international units in 2014 and expect to improve on this number in 2015. Our focused brand structure is clearly paying dividends with Pizza Hut development. However, Pizza Hut\u2019s more than a new unit story as you all know Pizza Hut launch his new menu in the U.S driven by the flavor of new brand positioning in December. I would be remits if I didn\u2019t tell you sales were softer than we expected with our initial launch and I absolutely believe our product in brand positioning arrive but we struggle to get our communications balance to build the new brand positioning while still connecting with our core-customer. However, this is a long term strategic initiative, we are excited by the fact that the people who have tried it, love it. Repurchase in temp is greater than 90%. Look this is just a first innings we are working to drive more customer trial as a rapid pricing campaign evolved to drive self through shopper product and crossing office. And impressively, we've seen operational pick up from the new menu. I know new Pizza Hut CEO David Gibbs and his team our focus on getting the advertising and crossing right to ensure that their brand building efforts pay huge dividends. We also enhanced the Pizza Hut mobile app back in late November. Before the fourth quarter over 40% of delivering in carry out orders we're by digital. Over 50% of all digital orders are occurring through the app and mobile devices and digital sales grew 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. ", "Just this pass through Sunday, we saw over $10 million worth of peaks of app digital devices. Mocking the single biggest digital day in Pizza Hut's history believe me we absolutely understand importance of digital to complete acceptably in the Pizza category and are making significant investment in these area of the business. There is no doubt in my mind that the Flavor of Now is instrumental to building a more relevant consumer proposition for Pizza Hut. We've a long runway ahead of us and we are making the necessary decisions to drive future return both domestically and globally. ", "And finally, the Taco Bell. Taco Bell continues to fire on all cylinders. The breakfast launch last spring of the success and we continue to record strong margins. Breakfast was again 6% of the day part mix in the fourth quarter and we expect to further grow the layer with additional product innovation. I believe a lot of the momentum witnessed at Taco Bell is attributable towards inside driven brand positioning, product development, advertising and social engagement with core users. We are applying this to the other two brands and across the globe. And vice-versa, all ideas don\u2019t have to come from the U.S. or from Taco Bell. For example, we're taking a page from the success of our open-kitchen Taco Bell restaurant in Bangalore, India and I plan to open a similar restaurant in the U.S. in 2015. This sharing of ideas globally is especially important as we work to spread good ideas worldwide and across brand to make the brave decisions necessary to lead this food revolution. Our mobile app launch is also a solid start of Taco Bell. We've seen 2 million downloads so far. We expect 2015 to be another solid year as we focus on furthering our breakfast offerings, generating more innovation across all dayparts and optimizing our presence with next gen footprint.", "I'm thrilled to have Brian Niccol leading this brand and taking it to the next level Live Mas positioning. The opportunity that lies ahead of Taco Bell is really unmatched as we start to expand internationally and who better to take the brand global than Yum! We have the infrastructure, supply chain, franchise relationships, fixed brand, this brand's domestic success on a global scale. As I see it, we are just in the early days of taking this brand to a new level. ", "So in conclusion, we have an incredible growth opportunity ahead of us. Without a doubt, we are disappointed about the results out of China but we are addressing issue head-on and I believe the upside from this business is tremendous. Yum! is in a unique position. We have three iconic brands and I think we have an opportunity to make each of these brands stronger. My vision as CEO is to build three global iconic brands that people trust and champion. In order to do that, we have identified each brand's true known positioning that is a clear, compelling and relevant guidepost. As you saw at our New York Analyst Meeting each of the brand leaders is using these brand positioning and underlying principles to drive results through brands that are more relevant, more engaged, more connected and ultimately more caring. I believe this will overly translate to consistent results that will reward our shareholders. ", "And for now it gives me much please to hand over to Pat to take you to thorough details on the financials. Over to you.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas. Our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2015 and our ownership strategy. For the fourth quarter EPS excluding special items declined 29%. Reported EPS was negative, primarily due to a non-cash special item charge of $361 million related to further impairment of Little Sheep assets in China which I'll cover in a minute. I'll start with a broader discussion of our China business and then move into our other divisions.", "As we outlined at our December Investor Meeting, same store sales KFC China are recovering at a slower pace than we initially expected and declined 18% for the fourth quarter which for China division includes the last four months of the year. Same store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining were more in line with our original estimates and declined 9% for the fourth quarter. These sales declines weighed heavily on restaurant profitability particularly as the fourth quarter is the seasonal low point China's fiscal year yielding a restaurant margin of 7.1% for the quarter.", "In addition to significant sales deleverage, we were also impacted by food inflation of 3% and labor inflation of 9% which combined had a negative 3% point impact to restaurant margin. While we're not pleased with these results, we expect the combination of sales improvement, modest pricing and responsible cost management to dramatically improve our China division's profitability as the year progresses with a particularly strong second half. ", "Given our long-term positive outlook for China and our continued belief that the current sales issues are temporary, we opened 737 new restaurants in the world's fastest growing economy. We also continued our disciplined approach to development shifting our new unit program towards high return investments. As evidence of this, Pizza Hut Casual Dining still delivering 18% restaurant margin in a year when same store sales declined 5% comprised nearly 40% of our new unit openings in 2014. ", "Now before moving to our other divisions, I want to provide some color on the impairment charge that we took in the quarter related to Little Sheep. Due to sustained same store sales declines, significant store closures and the evolution toward a more franchise led business we determined that it was appropriate to further write-down our investment in Little Sheep and therefore recorded a non-cash special item net charge of $361 million. We are extremely disappointed with the performance of Little Sheep since we acquired the business in 2012. It has clearly fallen well short of our expectations and hasn\u2019t yet achieved the unit level economics necessary to justify the expansion we had envisioned for this concept. We have a small dedicated team focused on improving this business and pending the outcome of these efforts will evaluate our options with Little Sheep later this year. ", "Now moving to our global KFC division which posted its strongest quarter of the year with solid improvements in sales, margins and profit. Systems sales growth was especially strong in emerging market up 12% led by Russia, Africa and Thailand. International developed market also delivered solid systems sales growth up 5% led by the UK, Continental Europe and Australia and the U.S posted its strongest quarter of same stores sales growth in nine years of 6%. Operating profit grew an impressive 19% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation this included a benefit of 3 percentage points from the favorable resolution of the pension matter in the UK. Importantly KFC stead a new record for international development in 2014 opening 666 new restaurants demonstrating the global power of this iconic brand.", "Our global Pizza Hut division posted flat same stores sales growth for the quarter. Although this was the lower expectations it represented another sequential improvement in quarterly sales performance since the start of the year. Despite this improving sales trends operating profits decline 11% driven by 2.7 percentage point decrease in restaurant margin coupled with strategic investments in international G&A to lay the foundation for future growth. On the positive side the quarter capped a year of record level development for the Pizza Hut brand opening 465 new international units capitalizing on the continued strong growth of the Pizza delivery category globally. And finally Taco Bell which posted their best quarter of the year with operating profit growth of 20% global same stores sales grew 6% including 7% same stores sales growth in the U.S driven by breakfast the launch of our dollar credence menu in our recent Sony big box promotion. Restaurant margin improved 0.1 percentage point to 20.6% raising full year margin to approximately 19%.", "Additionally, we opened 236 new stores this year our strongest weighted development in more than a decade. Almost 90% of these new restaurants were opened by franchisees further demonstrated the attractive investment returns to the Taco Bell brand generates. I know like to talk about our 2015 outlook we are full committed to delivering EPS growth of at least 10% this year. And consistent with the plans, we laid out in early December at our Investor Meeting we have a path to achieve this target without profit growth from our largest business KFC China. The pace of sales recovery in this business remains difficult to predict and we'll have much better visibility to this trajectory and the implications for KFC China's profit growth and young EPS growth as the year progresses. Along these lines, our path to at least 10% EPS growth has become tougher. The major change is foreign currency translation. We initially estimated exposure of at least 1 percentage point of EPS for the year but based on current spot rates and projections that could now be around 4 percentage points of full year EPS headwinds. To be clear this exposure is largely one of profit translation and does not impact our competitive position as it relates to how we place our products around the world. The vast majority of our input costs on a local currency where we operate so swings in foreign exchange rates have no real impact to our pricing or competitive value. ", "With respect to China, Pizza Hut sales are about where we thought it is. But KFC continues to recover at a slower pace than we anticipated. Same stores sales for KFC did not improve in the month of December and January as we expected, as recent promotions were too narrowly focused from a consumer perspective. We've taken swift action to develop new advertising and new local store marketing programs to strengthen our overall promotions with broader appeal to our core-customers during the upcoming Chinese New Year period. We expect these actions will deliver improved results in the coming weeks. In spite of these headwinds, we remain committed to delivering at least 10% full year EPS growth for 2015 with the first half negative and the second half strongly positive just as we outlined in New York. However, based on current trends, we expect China same stores sales for the first quarter which is limited to the month of January and February will be in a negative mid-teen range. Combining these with our new expectations for foreign exchange we estimate that young EPS in the first quarter of 2015 will be about 20% lower than prior year. So with a weaker than expected start to the year why am I confident it will deliver at least 10% full year EPS growth for 2015. Here is the key reason number one, we expect China division to have a very strong second half bolstered by A the gift of time and the demonstrated resilience of our brand including the upward trend in our key consumer metrics. B two menu rebounds including new breakfast innovation and the continued roll out of premium coffee at KFC. C, two menu revamps and the expansion of our breakfast afternoon tea and late night programs at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. And D, new product and digital innovation at Pizza Hut Home Service. We are also continuing prudent new unit development of all three businesses, while making the investments necessary to contemporize our brands to keep pace with the changing China. We have enormous profit leverage in our China business, so when sales recovery as we expect they will, we are positioned to realize a significant uplift in division operating profit similar to what we achieved in the first half of 2014. In fact, as sales recover to 2012 levels, we believe there is $600 million of latent profit potential just with our current assets underground.", "Number two, we expect positive momentum to sustain at both KFC and Taco Bell divisions which together account for about 55% of our global operating profit supported by more breakthrough product innovation, solid franchise driven at new unit pipeline plus the rollover benefit from last year's record development and continued progress on digital. ", "Number three; we expect Pizza Hut division sales and profits to strengthen across the year as we accelerate the pace of international development particularly in emerging markets building on last year's record level additions which benefit this year. Improve the execution of our brand re-launch in the U.S. with more targeted product news, promotional offers and marketing communications continue to improve and expand our digital platforms and leverage our best product innovation ideas from around the world. ", "Now I'd like to quickly cover our ownership strategy and how we make decisions where to invest equity. First from a global perspective, we lead with franchise development with our franchisees opening over 1,500 restaurants around the world including the vast majority of new units opened at our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell divisions. Second, we maintain purposeful equity investments on the basis of financial and strategic criteria. On the financial side, we own equity where we generally have high growth, strong returns and strong operating capability. On a strategic side, we have equity positions that allow us to innovate our concepts, build capability and lead the growth of our system. And third, we refranchise when we believe the franchise model creates more shareholder value. In fact after a conducting a comprehensive review of our equity business, we announced in December our intent to become even more franchised as a company. ", "Currently, we are slightly more than 90% franchise outside of China and India and we're going to take that to approximately 95% franchised over the next three years. With this, we expect operating margin for these businesses to improve from 24% in 2014 to over 30% in 2017. For China and India, we realized there are opportunities to unlock shareholder value to refranchising as well. We will be picking up the pace of refranchising and franchise development in these divisions and expect to be approximately 10% franchised in China and 85% to 90% franchised in India by 2017. We expect the profitability and capital efficiency of our businesses will improve with this refranchising and importantly these actions along with the China sales recovery will boost our return on invested capital which we expect to reach at least 22% on 2017.", "Finally, we pay a dividend which we've grown at a double-digit rate every year since we first paid the dividend in 2004. This equates to an annual dividend yield of about 2% which is very competitive for a company with our growth profile and we're committed to that.", "So let me wrap things up, while we see additional headwinds for 2015 and the recovery at KFC China is taking longer than we anticipated, we are committed to EPS growth of at least 10% and restoring our track record of double-digit EPS growth going forward. We are also committed to ensuring the ownership model, create shareholder value and we'll be increasing our franchise mix in the years ahead.", "And with that, I'll hand things back over to Greg.", "Greg Creed", "Thanks Pat. Before we begin the Q&A, let me just tell you why I'm passionate about this company and believe in the future of Yum! Brands. First, we have three iconic brands with incredible global infrastructure and franchise capability to facilitate growth. That's a strong competitive advantage to start with. Second, we have a China business with leading brands, supply chain, development expertise and of course people. Other companies would kill for what we have. Yes we've had some challenges over the past couple of years which have been painful for our shareholders. But that doesn\u2019t erase the company we built over the years, while the enormous opportunity ahead of us. We're going to turn this business around and when we do, we have a tremendous sales leverage opportunity to capture and I'm confident we will.", "Our KFC division is an emerging market powerhouse as strong as this business I know it can get stronger. The top 10% of our restaurants are generating sales that are more than double the average KFC. Our assets are under-leveraged. We're going to remedy this by expanding operating hours, leveraging digital and strengthening the core and we expect the recent improved performance in the U.S. to continue.", "Pizza Hut it's a powerful brand that quite frankly has underperformed over the past few years, but we adjusted a record in new unit openings. Think about this, if we can set a record in new unit openings when the brand is not growing same-store sales, just imagine what we can do when we get sales going. We're making digital our top priority and we're going to perform much better. ", "Taco Bell is accelerating the unit opening lunch, breakfast and mobile ordering has fantastic innovation in high teen restaurant margins and with more focus and investment behind Taco Bell international I know we're going to make a significant progress in taking Taco Bell global as an organization we're going to build stronger brand we're going to have sharper our brand positioning and inside driven marketing program. And we're going to focus on the following areas more product customization, more transparency, leading innovation and much more engagement through social media and digital. And finally we're going to continue to give back to the community and deliver on our social responsibility commitment. All of these lead my goal of having brands that people stuff and champion is going to take hurries to do the right thing and it's going to take time. But we have to scale and the resources to do it. I firmly believe we're going to build stronger brand and all of these will lead to strong returns for our shareholders in 2015 and over the long term. ", "So now I'll hand it back to Steve will commence to Q&A.", "Steve Schmitt ", "Okay we are ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Our first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe", "I just want to see if I caught a comment and then I'll have a question on that. It sounds like refranchising in China and India would actually be additive to profits in the near-term. Is that what I heard? ", "Greg Creed", "John I would say I'm not meaningfully additive.", "John Ivankoe", "Okay, but at least not dilutive. And then when we talk about cash flow and returns in some of these other things, it would clearly be accretive. So I guess there are two schools of thought with re-franchising, one of which, you know, you sell stores at a relatively low margin because you can, we talked about, have these sales not be dilutive to profit or maybe even modestly accretive to profit and let the franchisees turn around the system from a fairly low base. And there's another school of thought that you re-franchise stores once the brand has regained strength and is showing increases in same-store sales and margins and what have you, so you can put new stores in the hands of franchisees with some momentum behind them. So do you subscribe to either one of those schools of thought? Or how should we be thinking about re-franchising, broadly, especially when we think about the existing base of margins, for example, of Pizza Hut globally or especially China on a system wide basis?", "Greg Creed", "John generally speaking we love the franchise model we think it\u2019s a powerful way to create shareholder value and we've demonstrated that overtime. Our equity positions have been quite purposeful as we've talked about. But we've always guided our ownership with believe that we earned the right to own and this were we're not continuing to earn the right own and what we believe those units will create more shareholder value in the hands of franchisees capable franchisees who been continue to build the brand and develop alongside us as equity operators that\u2019s the direction we're headed. So our strategy hasn\u2019t changed at all guided by the underwrite to own if anything I would say building on what we presented in New York. Our goal is to be even more discipline in that regard.", "John Ivankoe", "So just to understand, you have no problem re-franchising stores at a relatively low price at a relatively low margin, if that's what you think is right for the long term of the business? ", "Greg Creed", "When we structure our refranchising deal we structure prices that we believe are there based on the current operating performance of those unit. And what we believe is there potential in the years ahead fair prices.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of David Palmer RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "David Palmer ", "You mentioned consumer perception scores are improving in China. Have those scores continued to improve even in recent weeks and months, or are those stalling out lately? And versus the competition, are you seeing a divergence in perceptions? Because it does appear that perhaps competitors are recovering more quickly. And what is that telling you about the business? And then lastly, is there anything in terms of your comparisons in the first quarter, perhaps marketing, media waits and other, that we should know about? Thank you. ", "Greg Creed", "David let me just say that the good news is that there has been sequential improvement in the metrics. Obviously we get KFC on a monthly basis that we're seen a month to month improvement in KFC obviously on Pizza Hut to get on quarterly basis. But the good news is that whether its food safety or trusts worthy on a liable brand all of those metrics are improving on a month to month basis. So that\u2019s the good news. The second part of your question was.", "David Palmer ", "About how does that compare to the competition and perhaps what does that tell you about how you handle it and perhaps how the consumers view you competitively on those trust scores. And then lastly, in terms of the comparisons on your marketing and media wait, is there anything to note there in terms of how we view this first quarter? ", "Greg Creed", "I think the good news is that the consumer metrics are in line with our key competitors in China. I mean they were planning in that the same direction at the same time. So I think in that sense there is no really disconnect between the including and metrics are now key competitors metrics. I think as you know a key competitor had greater sales originally then we had I put that down to the performance of the promotions that we were running in both December and obviously as we started running to the New Year. I think what's really important is that I think we're sequentially getting better and I think we've learned that, as Pat actually referred to in his commentary, we try to make the --no we've try to be useful in contemporary and maybe we got a little bit tune out and walked away from our course, but I'm excited about in the discussions I've been having with Sam and Joey, they were already course corrected. The advertising for the Chinese New Year promotion. We've also added some local store marketing for what will be the Chinese new promotion so what I'm really about is that course correcting very quickly when the promotions aren\u2019t working. We realized where we can get better and we're making those changes immediately.", "Next question please Sharon.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Glass, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass", "If I could just ask one other question on China sales recovery, and then I have one on margin, is there anything to read into the fact that the Pizza Hut business is stronger than KFC, other than that supplier issue? In other words, does it say something about how the consumer is changing there? How do you know that's not the underlying or one of the underlying issues? Maybe can you speak to is it maybe is there an asset base issue at KFC that needs to be addressed as well as some of the promotions? ", "Greg Creed", "John I think as we look at everything from the consumer metrics everything else, we do believe that as we know KFC had two incidents consecutively, Pizza Hut had one. Pizza Hut's recovering in line with other people recovering in the marketplace. And we really do believe it's down to the fact that unfortunately KFC had two things. Now let's not forget KFC is the number one brand in China and obviously the growth that we've had from Pizza Hut over the years and continue to have as Pat talked about, so I remain incredibly confident in both KFC and Pizza Hut in China. And I'm just totally-totally confident that we're going to turn the thing around.", "Pat Grismer", "And John to the second part of your question around the role of the asset plays in all of this, as we outlined in New York, we see asset image being a critical component of our overall strategy to contemporize the brand. Last year we remodeled a bit over -- a bit more than 300 units, we'll do more than twice that number this year, as we look to move more aggressively to contemporize our assets recognizing that a fair portion of the stake was built just in the last five years so overall it's a fairly contemporary stake but for some of our older assets we will be moving more aggressively over the next year with a different remodel package in order to make a better progress there.", "Thanks John. Next question please Sharon.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner, UBS. Your line is open.", "Keith Siegner", "Just to follow on the China theme a little bit longer, at the modeling session at the analyst event there was a 2015 guidance for what was hopefully 16%-plus on restaurant-level margins in China for the year. Given the updated thoughts on the top line, does that margin still hold or can we have an update to that margin outlook, please? Thanks. ", "Greg Creed", "Yes margin we still expect for the full year -- for the division to be at least 16%. ", "Keith Siegner", "Restaurant level margins, right?", "Greg Creed", "Yes, that is correct.", "Keith Siegner", "And if I could just sneak in a second one, is there any way you could give us some color? Are there pockets of weakness, pockets of strength? Is it tier 1 and tier 2, driven either above or below the average? Is it tier 4 through 6? Any kind of color you can give us to any potential pockets of weakness or strength in that same-store sales recovery would be helpful. ", "Greg Creed", "Yes Keith in the most recent quarter, we did see Tier 1 stores outperform -- the balance of the market, but really nothing to report other than that and our best assessment of that is that Tier 1 consumers seem to be maybe a little less phased by the supplier publicity this time around we're continuing to monitor this and at present we have nothing else really meaningful to share on that.", "Next question please Sharon.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Two questions -- just one on the China side. You mentioned, Greg, that you've had two supplier issues in two years and that's what you attribute the slower recovery. I was just wondering, first, if you could talk a little bit about the potential of the damage that might have caused to the consumer and what gives you confidence that there isn't necessarily a third? What are you doing in terms of improving the supply chain, since the frequency of that has picked up and might have caused damage to the consumer perception of the brand? And the second question was just on Taco Bell. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on the value versus premium side of things. It seems like we are hearing less about the higher end, maybe more on the lower end. I'm just wondering how you view that higher end opportunity, especially with fast casual doing so well. ", "Greg Creed", "Yes well first of all as I said the all the consumer metrics were improving both on KFC and Pizza Hut and obviously there are no indicator what's going to happen and there are also no indicator of consumer confidence, so the good news is that those are improving all moving in the right direction and that's what obviously I think really underpins the confidence I have that when we combine that with promotions that at our core user with better marketing and better value we're going to see the quicker turnaround of the performance in China. So those are the things that give me the most confidence is the consumer, the consumer metrics is moving in the right direction. ", "On the Taco Bell story, I think Taco Bell had a great quarter as we all know when it was a combination of really everything. We had $5 box promotion with Sony. We had the launch of the value menu and I think that plus I think advertising in that really is resonating with the core user, it's driven out great consumer insights and human truth, so I really believe that Taco Bell is firing on all cylinders whether it's a $5 or whether it's just an engagement with the customer so very confident in the future of Taco Bell.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "But any efforts to prevent a third type incident? Is there any changes in terms of the supply chain? ", "Greg Creed", "Obviously as you can imagine we've put a lot of things in place we\u2019ve now got which will blow our program we've obviously stepped up obviously the I guess the order thing is going on without supply I mean I think the one thing I can't promise is when they've happening if because if people are going to law and sheet do the wrong the thing. But you've got close like a TV which will blow our programs and expensive ordering going on I think we're doing all the right things you aspect to the later. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Buckley Bank of America. Your line is open. ", "Joe Buckley", "Also on China, could you just talk a little bit more about the December-January promotions? You described them as being too narrow, and just kind of what that means. And put perspective -- the planned menu revamps, how extensive will they be compared to the late March 2014 brand relaunch at KFC China? ", "Greg Creed", "Sure I think the first promotion, there is no doubt the team is right being trying to make the brand more youthful and contemporary. That\u2019s a really good thing that we're doing. But I think in the promotion everywhere this was around the Canadian brand here it so we obviously made it just too narrow and so we didn\u2019t really appeal to about core customer and I think was great and we're youthful and contemporary, the expression which was its Korean brand was actually just much too narrow. And I think the good news the teams learn a lesson but the great thing about when you have these things happen and as I said having spoken to same and Joe I've already course to be advertising for the CRB part of the Chinese New Year has already being shinned with also added extra resources to local store marketing. So I'm really confident that if it didn\u2019t work there intent was right the execution wasn\u2019t and we've learn it and we've already change the execution going forward. So that seems like all really good. The two main re-events obviously the big one will actually have in the first half the second one is not as quite as big as the first one. But I think we have a lot of confidence in menu re-events we know that work for us in the past the first half of last year they've worked and I have the lot of confidence that with the innovation in the product and improvement they're going to make that will see profound effect from this menu re-event.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Senatore ", "One follow-up on China and then I have a question about Pizza Hut, if I may. Just on the China outlook it seems to me that January maybe got actually worse than December, based on what you are guiding to. And frequently as we are getting updates, it does feel like every time we get an update it's slower than expected or worse than expected. Can you just talk a little bit about is there a point at which you will entertain the idea that maybe you don't get back to peak volumes or you don't get back to peak margins, and maybe you think about the ownership structure a little bit differently? Just if we are sitting here in seven -- six, seven months from now and it doesn't look like you are getting the big bounce back in the second half, does that change your thoughts? And then my question on Pizza Hut is really, Greg, you did a great job with Taco Bell, I think really changed perception there. Can you just compare that to what's going on with Pizza Hut and what -- if the problems or the issues facing the brand are similar to what you saw, and how you think about that business? ", "Greg Creed", "I'll let Pat handle the first one and I'll take the Pizza there so.", "Pat Grismer", "Sarah on January sales in China I think the comps can be receiving right. So I was like to look at the underlying transactions and so we look at underlying transaction volumes on a weekly to season wise basis. And January was about in line with December so we've necessarily see the business deteriorate but didn\u2019t improved to the extent that we were expecting and so that\u2019s why I said we entered the year plus momentum that we had anticipated when we're all together in New York. As to what the pace looks like going forward as we've said the pace of recovery is slower than we expected best reason why was have the two incidence in two consecutive years. But there is no denying the fact that the business is recovering. We step back and we look at we're things were at the end of July were things were had in August and were things are today and there heck of lot better. We would have like to seen and we had anticipated the stronger recovery. But it\u2019s going to take longer but what we need it to give some time and we have strong believe in a programs of the team is lining which is sharpening as we've talked about to sustain the upper momentum. So that I would say by the time we lap the OSI incident in late July we expect comps to turn positive that is a longer recovery period than we've seen before. But we do see that recovery continuing and we know with that is substantial profit leverage. So we do expect that would be improving sales in the back half of the year will have improving margins and substantial improvement in overall profitability. Very similar to what we saw in the first half of 2014 so we don\u2019t have to go back to far in history to find good hard evidence of the resilience of our brands and our ability to bring the profit back in that business. As it relates to long term ownership again we take a long term view of our business we're in China for the long term and the last two years of volatility while yet painful don\u2019t erase more than a decade of substantial value creation China remains the biggest retail development opportunity in the world and we are the leaders in that market. So our view on the market to long term do we look opportunities to refine our ownership model, yes as we've indicated we've pivoting to quietly higher franchise ownership where it makes sense, where we can sensibly do that, given the nascency of franchising in China today. But we have strong belief in the power of our brands and the strength of our teams and our leading position in that market and we believe that that recovery is going to progress across this year.", "Greg Creed ", "So on the Pizza Hut story it's -- the flavor of now I love I think it's a positioning that is so right with what's happening in the entire food market, so I think that to start with. There's no doubt we want to make Pizza Hut more useful, now let's not talk Taco Bell it's a little bit more useful and the good news that's come out of the re-launch so far is that things like [rev] users as I think the 24 gone from like 6% of our business to 24% of our business. So we know that this whole new flavor is now positioning us resonate with them. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019t talking to our current abundant users and as we can tell we're now back on that with Rex Ryan and Tony Romo, so I think we're doing the right thing which is the flavor of them has really resonated with the younger customer audience where we've been really going after which is great. At the same time we got to make sure we don\u2019t lose our abundant customer, we want to make sure that that we've offered a great sort of pepperonis at a great price and what I'm excited about is we got 90% repeat on those who try the new products so getting more type of those new products will also be critical so I'm very happy with I think where we're going to take this brand and the positioning would anchor us around.", "Sharon next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino", "I'm going to give this question on China one more shot. My question is, how do you conclude that the recent trend was more related to those promotions you mentioned and not some structural issue with the brand that's happened post these two events? And said differently, how do you get confident that this recent trend in the sales volumes isn't more of just a new reality from which you have to grow from? ", "Pat Grismer", "I would say our best indication David is the consumer metrics that we're seeing brand I trust food and safety we've seen as Greg mentioned steady improvement month and month and no scores. As we discussed the recent promotions underperformed from the sales perspective, but consumer metrics continues to show improvement, so in our view it's a matter of getting the promotions right and we're taking strict action to show those up in the next several weeks here ahead of the first of our two menu revamps this year. So we have not seen anything at this stage which would give us a reason to believe that what we have here is a new normal. We think that this situation is temporary and again we faced a similar set of circumstances a year ago and we have the dramatic recovery in our China business just in the first half of 2014 so there's recent evidence that our brands are resilient. They'll bounce back. It's harder this time around because we've had the two incidents in two years, so that's why the recovery is taking longer. But as we've said recovery is progressing not at the pace that we'd like but its progressing and we continue to believe strongly that we'll have a strong second half.", "Greg Creed", "I mean David let me just I hadn\u2019t run Taco Bell for a long time. I've had my share of incidents. So I know what these are like. They're not linear. They never recover on a linear basis, but we do know that great iconic brands always recover. And we know what to do, we have to do innovation, we have to get our core customer back engaged and we had a very frank assessment of the promotion in January and December and we didn\u2019t get it right. And -- but the most important thing is, we're making changes going forward and that to me is really important so having been in the same situation that Sam and the team are. I've been in this situation. I have absolute confidence that iconic brands come back and they come back stronger than they were even some times before they went into it. I think Taco Bell is living proof of why I have absolute confidence we'll do that in China.", "Next question please Sharon.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse", "So sorry to ask the same question in another way, but one of the things I think we've been seeing in general consumer reports about China is that health and wellness is becoming a bigger concern and a bigger focus for the average consumer there. Have you done anything in terms of your positioning in perceptions of health and wellness and/or just your sense of whether that is becoming a bigger focus of the Chinese consumer? And maybe potentially that's an overhang on the brand beyond [new] brand scores and whatnot that sounds like, say, everything should be getting better. ", "Greg Creed", "I think that what you talked about we're seeing on a global scale right it's we're not just seeing it in China, we're not just seeing in the United States, we're seeing it everywhere. Clearly what you would call health and wellness those -- the importance of that is clearly growing. So I think that in a sense just like at Taco Bell we offer Fresco and at Pizza Hut we offer Skinny Pie and at KFC we offer grilled, and in China we offer congee, and vegetables and food and milk and all that sort of things, so it's -- I don\u2019t think China is ahead of anyone else, I don\u2019t think China is behind anyone else. I think that at the end of the day, we've got choice with our customers to make, but at the same time we got to make sure that the promotions that we run are relevant and appeal to our core audience and we just simply got to do a better job of that in China.", "Karen Holthouse", "But if you look at some of the products you just mentioned, how big are they actually as a percent of sales versus the core menu that's more fried chicken and fries? And then I have to imagine if you were to look at the overall market, kind of young's share of what you would consider traditional, not necessarily healthy fast food is a lot higher than your share of more traditional congee, vegetable soup, that sort of thing? ", "Greg Creed", "Accounted to mean why look at these things mix around 2% doesn\u2019t matter what Taco Bell it doesn\u2019t matter what it is these things started to have huge mixes. But the key is for us to give the customer a choice and I think that\u2019s what we do doesn\u2019t matter on what brand and what country what we got a valuable for our customer is choice. But the mix is we'll probably stepping around 3% I think that there are much bigger things of play I mean making sure that we've got great food a great value making sure that our brands are relevant making sure that this share worthy. I mean all these sort of things I was important there is not one thing is driving it is and a specific thing all these on a global scale and we're reacting to them on the global basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer Company. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner", "You talk about unlocking shareholder value in China by leveraging the recovery into significant earnings growth and maybe taking a more disciplined franchising approach there. And that's definitely going to serve your shareholders well. But at the same time, the business outside of China -- it's very franchised, very highly franchised. The business is very under-levered and performing very, very well. Taco Bell, KFC -- just great results. And your peers are getting really strong appreciation in the public markets for similar type business models that you guys arguably are not. I'm just wondering if there's anything you can do to capitalize on that dynamic to unlock shareholder value, not necessarily from a business operations standpoint. But maybe is there an appetite to maybe take on more leverage? Or anything that you can talk about, your way of thinking there would be helpful. ", "Greg Creed", "Well let me start and then I will handover to Pat. We will always have the often structure to drive shareholder value let me be really clear. Right now obviously we believe turning China around is the key and obviously we believe China is a long term play for us I think that\u2019s very clear.", "Pat Grismer", "And certainly as it relates to ownership level outside the U.S and how that relates to our capital structure. I think I won't understand based on what we outlined in New York that we are pivoting to a more highly franchise model going forward and we expect those franchise percentages to edge up over the next three years. With respect to capital structure we look at things the enterprise level. So we don\u2019t segment our balance sheet by division and we look at our capital structure the enterprise level based on the adjusted leverage ratios that rating agencies look at and how that relates to our cost of capital. As I outlined in New York having taking the advices three large independent Bank who have check our analysis to make sure we're thinking about just right way we believe that our current leverage ratio which is a lowest run of investment great credit. We optimize our weighted average cost of capital. If we were to take on additional debt to an extent that we take us into junk bond territory as we do the number we see what I would characterize as a modest amount accretion and frankly given the trade off in terms of reduced flexibility and our ability to optimize that weighted average cost of capital across economic cycle. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good result it's not in the best interest of our shareholder in our judgment. But we do look at it as I know you'd expect we do look at couple a time in year we put a lot of rigor behind it because we are very concerned about making sure that our capital structure is the right one for our shareholders in long term. The one that supports our ability to return cash to our shareholders the way that we have consistently through a combination of a growing dividend and substantial share buyback were also having the cash necessary to continue to invest aggressively behind growth opportunities.", "Greg Creed ", "I would add just some we've got a great track record of driving shareholders value and we obviously believe that model will deliver outstanding returns going forward.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ", "Jeff Farmer", "Just following up on several recent questions, specifically a lot of those about the recent products and promotion stuff that's going on at KFC in China -- so I'm just curious. Are you guys able to test a lot of that new product and promotion strategies before you implement them? And if not, I'm curious what gives you confidence that you are making appropriate strategy shifts as we get deeper into 2015? ", "Greg Creed", "We have a very rigorous discipline process in China and we can't hit everything I don\u2019t teach and go out test rock bands and rock bands and those like things they get a little bit more difficult to test. But I think the repositioning of tower products or the new product in the more traditional sides we can definitely test and in fact I would say that China has probably has one of the most rigorous testing methods and in fact a lot of this is adopted those methods outside of China among the other brand. So I am confident that over right testing is going we can test some but sometimes you just can't test every possible promotion.", "Operator", "The next question comes from line of Peter Saleh Telsey Advisor Group. Your line is open.", "Peter Saleh ", "I just wanted to come back to the China menu revamp. If I recall correctly, last year there was more of a check benefit from the revamp of the menu. And there wasn't a traffic increase, but more of the comp came from increases in the average check. When you think about the revamp this year, at least the first one, are you targeting more of a traffic or maybe more of a check increase similar to last year? ", "Pat Grismer ", "Peter, we expect with all our innovation to build transaction momentum. Now with the construct of the menu revamp with some more premium products, we also expect to check benefit. This will improve profitability, but our goal, our goal over the long run is to rebuilt the traffic that we've lost and so we do expect that with this menu revamp there's going to be sufficient innovation and continued focus on value to sustain the traffic momentum necessary to recover the business and realize that that full upside profit potential.", "Next question please Sharon and this is our last question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy", "Just one more quick question on China -- I appreciate the comments about the consumer perception scores improving and your blueprint for sales recovery in the region. I wanted to get a sense on your take. Have you seen any change in demand among potential franchisees in the market following the recent supplier issues? I know you are building towards a 10% franchise goal by fiscal 2017. I just wanted to get any color on any potential changes among franchisees you are targeting. ", "Greg Creed", "Yes no changes R.J. We regained the number brand even with the issues that we've experienced. And our pipeline of franchisees comes from our restaurant general managers and area managers, so we continue to develop strong capability there and among our table of RGMs, general managers, our entrepreneurs who are -- who remain quite eager to take on the opportunity to own and operate our KFC restaurants predominantly in our Tier 1 cities, so that continues to be the strategy. We've not seen any slackening of demand in that regard.", "Greg Creed", "Yes so thank you everybody. First of all thanks for being on the call. I just like to thank I think by saying I was personally delighted to see Taco Bell had a great fourth quarter. And I think a lot of the things that we've done at Taco Bell whether it's a very clear trend or whether it's really very insight driven, whether it's we've got really amazing innovation, advertising that connects and a social mobile digital that really engages with our customers, I think that's what has really helped Taco Bell had a great fourth quarter and a great year. So it probably should come as no surprise to anybody those are maybe the things that are going to be driving as I -- in I go further I visit countries and I'm talking to the brands that don\u2019t be surprised to see me focusing on the exactly those same things because I know they\u2019ve worked at Taco Bell. I absolutely believe we can do them in KFC and Pizza Hut in every country around the world. So with that I really appreciate you all being on the call and I look forward to seeing you soon.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed our CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from Greg and Pat, we will take your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements.

Our second quarter earnings will be released on Tuesday, July 14th.", "With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr.Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed", "Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. You can never be pleased when you report an EPS decline for the quarter, but the story behind the numbers gives me even more confidence that we can and will deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2015. I would summarize our performance as our KFC and Taco Bell divisions are firing on all cylinders. China is clearly improving and there\u2019s still much work to be done at Pizza Hut.", "Let\u2019s start with China. Same-store sales declined 12% for the quarter. The best I could tell the whole story. The fact is that the business is clearly improving. Same-store sales and customer metrics continue to move in the right direction. In addition, the team has done an impressive job managing costs and delivered the restaurant margins of nearly 19% in the quarter. It\u2019s the combination of these three elements that gives me confidence will deliver on the first half, second half performance transformation I described at our Analyst Meeting in December.", "Just last month Sam Su and I assembled a task force to share insights and experience on other parts of our business with the KFC China team. While the local team clearly has an unsurpassed knowledge of the China market, other teams from around the Yum! world have broad expertise and know how we thought could benefit the China team and vice-versa. It was tremendous team work and best practice sharing going both ways and I was truly impressed by the talent of our teams. We also reviewed China\u2019s marketing plans for each brand and are less even more confident in our outlook for the year and the strong second half we expect and here is why.", "First KFC. We recently launched the first of our two menu revamps planned for the year. This initiative will be taken over the next three months and includes eight new products focused on the lunch and dinner. In addition to traditional KFC offerings this revamp includes product and the consumers interested in healthy alternatives such as herbal tea and seafood. ", "We\u2019re also continuing our premium coffee rollout priced 40% below Starbucks and 20% McCafe, our freshly grind coffee is offered throughout the day. Initial reading show an incremental weekly sales layout of around $300 per store and we\u2019re just getting started. As of quarter end we were in 1,300 stores spanning 10 cities. By year end we expect to have premium coffee in almost 2,500 stores. Our expectation is that coffee will become a solid sales layer to further build growth upon. ", "And we continue innovate on all fronts not just our menu this includes accelerating active enhancements, digital marketing and leveraging our online delivery platform. Clearly there\u2019s a lot to be excited about with the KFC China.", "At Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China,we are also encouraged by the ongoing improvement in same-store sales. We\u2019re leveraging the assets throughout the day with the rollout of breakfast and continue to expand our late night offering. Pizza Hut is a new development product -- development machine and we\u2019re excited about the recent launch of our sizzling fajitas leveraging our [indiscernible] platform. ", "In addition to the Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, we continue to expand our home service offering where we\u2019re approaching 300 units in China. This business offers a diverse menu with Chinese food comprising nearly half of its products. Any way you look at it the Pizza Hut business has a long runway for growth in China.", "So to summarize China, we\u2019re making continued progress with sales and customer metrics. We\u2019re pleased with the productivity gains in our restaurants and we have confidence in our marketing plans for balance of the year. Most importantly, we continue to develop new restaurants with confidence laying the foundation for future growth in the world\u2019s fastest growing economy.", "Outside of China, I\u2019m excited to report that the strong momentum at KFC continued. Same-store sales growth of 5% build upon last quarter\u2019s 4%. The division opened 72 new international restaurants in 36 countries. Nearly 80% of these restaurants were opened in emerging markets. I was particularly pleased with the continued impressive growth from our Russia business where system sales grew nearly 50% in constant currency. Simply put KFC is a franchise led global powerhouse with a significant lead in many emerging markets and tremendous growth ahead. With its always original positioning, I believe KFC is poised to deliver consistently strong results going forward.", "One of the significant competitive advantages KFC has is its partnership with strong international franchisees. I personally believe that our franchisees are one of our company\u2019s greatest assets and one of the key to success in this business is to work with your franchise partners. On February 27th the KFC U.S. team led by Jason Marker reached an agreement with our franchises to work together as true partners. This agreement gives us clear marketing control for the first time as well as an accelerated path to improve assets and customer experience. Pat will share the financial details with you during his remarks.", "Moving to our Pizza Hut division where our results have admittedly been soft and worse yet we\u2019re being outperformed by the competition. As you know we recently launched a new pizza platform in the U.S. where over half the division\u2019s profits are generated. This new platform gives our customers unparalleled variety with exciting new toppings, crusts and flavors. Unfortunately we haven\u2019t been as effective as we\u2019ve liked with our marketing and need to balance its appeal to Millennialswith mainstream pizza customers. We intend to do this going forward while working with our franchisees to bring more competitive value to the market.", "I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to announce an investment we\u2019ve made which will improve our company\u2019s capability and benefit Pizza Hut and all of Yum! Clearly one of the towering strengths of Taco Bell is its superb consumer insights. Over the years a lot of this came from the Collider laban inside driven marketing company. Because better consumer insights is one of our key priorities we decided to bring Collider in house. It\u2019s very first priority will be Pizza Hut in the U.S. In fact we made its former president Jeff Fox the Chief Concept and Brand Officer of the division. We believe Collider\u2019s insights will be extremely valuable to Yum! overall and it\u2019s going to start with Pizza Hut.", "On the international front, Pizza Hut continues to expand rapidly and we opened 35 new international restaurants in 20 countries during the quarter. Our brand focused structure is clearly paying dividends on the development front and we expect record international expansion this year. We\u2019re also making the needed investments in digital for all of Pizza Hut. We have a firm grasp on what needs to improve and are taking the necessary actions globally to drive better performance.", "Now turning to Taco Bell which had another great quarter. Same-store sales grew 6% and operating profit jumped 37%. The division opened 47 new restaurants with franchises opening 89% of these units. I\u2019ve never been more confident in Taco Bell\u2019s ability to reach its goal of becoming a $14 billion business with 8,000 restaurants. By all measures Taco Bell continue to go from strength to strength and I\u2019m thrilled to see the team take the brand to a whole new level. Breakfast is doing well owing a 6% mix and the restaurant margins approach 20%. I recently spent time in some test markets and seen what they have in store and I can assure you our innovation pipeline will remain strong.", "International also continues to build upon the strong momentum for 2014 with 5% same-store sales growth in the quarter and the particularly strong performance in Latin America and Canada. While internationally it\u2019s only a small contributor today we continue to build brand awareness and to improve our economic model as we look to accelerate our international growth plans.", "So in conclusion we are making great strides across Yum! I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us as we recover in China build upon our existing momentum at KFC and Taco Bell and focus on turning around Pizza Hut. I\u2019m especially encouraged by the bench of talent we have across Yum! And how we are leveraging that to benefit the entire organization. We are in a unique position at Yum! With three distinct brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused on the three keys to driving shareholder value same-store sales growth, new unit development and generating high returns on invested capital. I believe this combination of efforts will enable us to re-establish our track record of consistently delivering double-digit EPS growth in 2015 and the years ahead.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn over to my partner Pat.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our first quarter results and share perspective on our second quarter and full year outlook. First quarter earnings per share excluding special items decreased 8% which was substantially better than the decline we were originally expecting. I\u2019m pleased with the quality of this upside as it was led by better than expected sales and restaurant margins at KFC China. With overall trend sustaining in China and with the most outstanding momentum we have in our Taco Bell and KFC businesses, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll have a strong second half and deliver at least 10% EPS growth this year even with stronger than expected headwinds from foreign exchange.", "Now I\u2019d like to provide some color on our first quarter results by division. In China operating profit declined 31% prior to foreign currency translation as same-store sales were down 12% in the quarter. Sales were strong during the Chinese New Year period comprising the last two weeks of China\u2019s eight week fiscal quarter and although restaurant margins of 19% were 4.5 percentage points lower than last year due to transaction deleverage this was a significant improvement over the 7 point decline we experienced in the preceding quarter as pricing and label productivity more than offset inflation in food and labor costs. ", "What this means is that restaurant level profit flow through is actually getting stronger thanks to the hard work of our local team to deploy labor more efficiently and to manage a more profitable mix of menu items. More importantly this bolsters our belief that China division restaurant margins will return to the 20% range as sales are recovered and that this recovery has the potential to unlock approximately $600 million of operating profit.", "Another important driver of our growth in China is new unit development and because we continue to shift our development focus to lower tier cities tighten our site criteria and improve our investment model we\u2019ve been able to maintain high rate of new store openings despite the temporary softness we\u2019ve seen in top-line results. In the first quarter alone we opened 171 new restaurants in China that\u2019s an average of nearly three restaurants per day bearing in mind that China\u2019s first quarter spans in months of January and February. We\u2019re confident that these investments will yield strong returns and continue to expect 700 new restaurants this year. Also with the breadth of our market presence and the scale of our development team we have the ability to capitalize on China\u2019s expanding economy in a way that no one else can in our sector.", "Moving to our global KFC division which posted a very strong quarter with solid growth in sales, margin and profit. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets up 11% before foreign exchange led by Russia, Africa and Thailand. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth up 6% before foreign exchange led by Australia, the UK and Continental Europe. And the U.S. delivered its third consecutive quarter of solid same-store sales growth with comps of 7% the best performance by this business in almost 10 years. ", "Division operating margin increased about 2 percentage points in the quarter to 26% driven by franchise led new unit development and stronger restaurant level margins across the board. All of this combined to yield division operating profit growth of 11% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. KFC opened 72 new international restaurants in the quarter and similar to previous years we expect our new unit development to ramp up significantly as the year progresses. ", "With the upward momentum we have in this business we expect KFC to open 700 new international restaurants outside of China and India this year setting a new record for this growing global brand. Same-store sales were flat for our global Pizza Hut division with growth of 2% in emerging markets and 1% in international developed markets and the decline of 1% in the U.S. Operating margin decreased 1.5 percentage points to 30% largely due to strategic investments in international [audio-gap] to support future growth contributing to a 2% decline in operating profit prior to foreign currency translation. And while the sales and overall profit results are disappointing last year\u2019s global brand restructuring has brought 100% leadership focus to the opportunities. ", "We have to improve Pizza Huts overall brand position operations and digital experience globally. We\u2019re already seeing the benefit of this in development, as Pizza Hut open 70 new restaurants in the first quarter including 35 new international restaurants setting us up to have another year of record development with 600 new international restaurants expected in 2015. Importantly about 90% of these restaurants will be open by franchisees demonstrating strong belief in the brands potential.", "We\u2019re also continuing to invest heavily behind digital and are seeing a promising return on these investments. Currently digital sales in the U.S. account for over 40% of delivery and carry out sales versus about 30% a year ago and we expect this to trend higher over the time. This is important because digital orders provide customers with the superior order experience try higher levels of royalty and generate higher average spend and finally Taco Bell posted in exceptionally strong quarter with same store sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin of nearly 20% which is about 4 points better than last year as pricing and favorable menu mix more than offset inflation during the quarter. ", "As a result operating margin increased about 5% percentage point to nearly 27% lifting operating profit by 37% versus prior year. As Greg said we could not be more pleased with the inside driven brand building efforts to Taco Bell evidence by category leading innovation and disruptive advertising. This obviously includes our new breakfast layer which is sustain sales mix at a very healthy 6% additionally we open 47 new restaurants in the first quarter with nearly 90% open by franchises and our opening 150 net new restaurants this year with international development accelerating in the years to come. Anyway you look at Taco Bell is a category leader and a brand on a move.", "Now, I\u2019d like to talk about our 2015 outlook. As I mentioned earlier we expect EPS growth of at least 10% this year. Outside of China, we expect KFC and Taco Bell to have very good year\u2019s, while Pizza Hut could remain soft. Therefore the key to double digit growth this year is a strong second half for China. In that regard our monthly sales can be highly variable in a recovery environment. Overall sales trends key consumer metrics and balance to your marketing plans give confidence the China will have a strong second half and as I said before the team has done enough standing job of managing restaurant margin and based on year to date results we continue to expect full year China restaurant margin of at least 16%, as I mentioned previously foreign currency translation has become an even strong headwind for us. Based on current spot rates and projections we now expect the foreign exchange may impact full year EPS by approximately 5 percentage points. This is one additional point of headwind compared to what we signaled on our last call.", "To be clear this exposure is one of profit translation and does not impact our competitive position as it relates to how we price our products around the world. So if you step back and think about how 2015 is developing, it\u2019s very consistent with our expectation coming into the year which is the negative first half followed by a very strong second half driven by China. Our first quarter performance was better than we anticipated, but still negative. Second quarter EPS will most likely show a steeper decline versus prior year. But let me put this into perspective. First, this is largely due to the fact that we\u2019re expecting a higher year-over-year quarterly tax rate compared to Q1. Second, we will be lapping China\u2019s strongest quarter from 2014 which you may remember included same store sales growth of 15% and operating profit growth of nearly 200% and third while we expecting Taco Bell to deliver another quarter of double digit profit growth. It won\u2019t be 37% as it was in Q1. So for the second quarter we\u2019re estimating EPS will lag prior year by about 20%, but we continue to believe that we have the overall business momentum that set us up for a strong second half to achieve at least 10% EPS growth for the full year.", "Now before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to provide some financial highlights of the agreements we reached with our KFC U.S. franchises which Greg briefly mentioned. Building on the strong business momentum, that\u2019s been built over the last year and in return for brand marketing control which will empower our KFC U.S. leadership team to sustain a turnaround of this business. We will be investing approximately $185 million over the next 3 years. This investment will include new pack of house equipment and incentive to accelerate asset remodels and incremental advertising money. All of which are essential to contemporize the brand and regain traction with consumers. From the timing perspective we expect to invest possibly $100 million this year with the remaining amount split between 2016 and 2017. Due to the unique long-term brand building nature of these investments they will be classified special items with the exception of advertising of about $20 million per year. Although this is a relatively modest investment in the [indiscernible] it is obviously quiet significant to KFC U.S. and we\u2019re confident it will unlock significant value in the years to come.", "So let me wrap things up, we\u2019re pleased that our first quarter results were stronger than expected due to robust performance of Taco Bell and KFC as well as the ongoing sales and margin recovery in China. We continue to expect at least 10% EPS growth this year with a very strong second half and we look forward to update you further as the year progresses and with that I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open.", "Diane Geissler", "I just wanted to ask about your overall expectation for same store sales growth in China. I mean obviously the first quarter was ahead of what you had articulated on your last quarterly call. You\u2019ve given guidance negative first half negative, positive second half. But could you just talk about it in terms of what your expectations on a percentage basis. Now that you outperformed in the first quarter and you have new product launches and et cetera.", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly Diane You may recall that we had guided in December to full year same store sales growth of 3% to 7% that still an appropriate range we may be coming in closure to the lower end of that range. But importantly we do expect to see sequential improvement in Q2 sales over Q1 and then the strong second half particularly as we as we lap the supplier incident that occurred in July.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC. Your line is open.", "David Palmer", "Thanks. Pat, you just said that you expect the same-store sales decline rate to moderate in the second quarter versus the first quarter for China. Did I catch that right?", "Pat Grismer", "That is correct. We do expect sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter and I would highlight even with the stronger comps that we\u2019re lapping from last year.", "David Palmer", "The last quarter there, you were talking about the promotion misses that may have happened in China, the Korean boy band promotion. Is there any color you can offer to us about what changes are already happening? I know there was a new menu that was probably in the works for some time, but perhaps a commentary about that menu. But also some things that you're thinking about in terms of a direction of the market that we may not see here for KFC in particular in China. Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Yes sure David. Good question. As we said we had a bad start with the boy band. I was really played with how quickly we reacted and how they very strong Chinese new year promotion. We got back to building an emotional connection with our customers. We got back into original recipe, we got back into buckets of chicken and I think that was a very clear lesson for us. The good news is on the menu revamp, this is going to be 8 new products over about 3 months. What I like about it is the lesson that we\u2019ve learnt this time is that and I think this is for the lessons we\u2019ve talked from the Taco Bell breakfast lunch which is you can put the menu out there. But you actually have to promote specific products. So I\u2019m pleased that we got a very strong menu. But we also have very strong product promotions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino", "Hi. Good morning. A question about the China trends. I think the release mentioned upward momentum in the consumer scores that you are seeing. I was wondering if you could maybe provide a little bit more context on what you are seeing and where you are from a consumer trust and feedback perception versus where you were heading into the supplier incident last year.", "Pat Grismer", "Sure. But I think the good news is as you would know we measure a number of attributes clearly value for money, food safety, trustworthiness and favorite brand. The good news is we\u2019re making a proven across all of those metric and I think that what you\u2019ll see is not a linear improvement. But we can definitely see period to period that we are making improvements across the board. So I\u2019m actually really encourage and it\u2019s across the board in a recovery rather specific elements.", "David Tarantino", "And any context on kind of where you are now versus where you were last June for example, maybe how much of the gap you've closed from the decline you saw post the incident?", "Pat Grismer", "Yes, sure. I think on things like trustworthiness were pretty much almost back to where we were prior to the instrument things like value the money, we\u2019re doing better. The good news is we have the right trajectory on all of the of all the [indiscernible].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff Farmer", "Can you provide the transaction price mix and mix components for that minus 14% KFC China comp, and just beyond that what your pricing expectations are for the balance of the year?", "Pat Grismer", "Yes, in terms of the mix the comp was lead by transaction decline check was marginally positive for the quarter and in terms of pricing. We love to take pricing inline more or less with inflation. We\u2019re targeting about 3 points for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from UBS. Your line is open.", "Keith Siegner", "Thanks. Pat, if you could dig in a little bit more into the China company restaurant margins for us, just a little bit more breakdown about where the costs are coming from. Maybe is it all KFC? What about Pizza Hut? What about Little Sheep? And then can you give us an -- or even amongst labor and your other pieces, you did some high-level, but more granular details would be helpful. And then also what's going on from an underlying labor and commodity cost perspective in China? There hasn't been much volatility in labor. Is that still the case, around 10%, and then what does the commodity cost inflation pressure look like? Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "So first in terms of how we break down the margin variants year-over-year. We are very pleased with 19% margin in the quarter. It was 4.5% points below where we were in the first quarter last year. We lost about 4 margin points from transaction develarge and another 3 margin points manipulation. But offset that with about 2 point margin benefit from pricing and then the other half point benefit was a combination of productivity initiatives, slightly offset by the impact of new unit. So that kind of breaks down the margin drivers, in terms of what we are seeing by the way of inflation. The good news is on the commodity front things are looking a little bit better than we\u2019ve originally guided. I think in New York we guided around 2% to 3% of commodity inflation. Look like closer to 2% maybe so slightly better there, the labor front the situation hasn\u2019t changed call it low double digit around 10% that we saw in the first quarter and that\u2019s more or less we expect for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass", "Thanks. Maybe just a few sort of detailed questions, but Pat, the G&A this quarter ran above I think what your annualized rate was. Maybe there was some FX in that. But how do you see G&A playing out this year? Is there more investment spending perhaps required than you thought, or is this just more about timing this quarter?", "Pat Grismer", "It\u2019s more about timing because we\u2019re what you are seeing in early part of the year is the full effect of the strategic investments that we made in our Pizza division importantly and international to built capability in development and digital which is where we see biggest opportunity to strengthen our competitive position. So as we lap those investments that was made up with the course of 2014, you\u2019ll see less of an increase year-over-year in G&A, no reason to change our guidance for full year on G&A.", "John Glass", "Okay. And then just two other quick ones. Forgive me if you said this. What was the labor inflation in China this quarter? And also since tax does play a big role in where you shake out in the second quarter, what is the rate you are implying in the tax rate in the second quarter?", "Pat Grismer", "Labor inflation in China was about 10%, in terms of tax I mentioned in my earlier remarks that is the key driver of the expected difference in Q2 EPS performance versus Q1, tax worked to our benefit in Q1, it\u2019s going to go against us in Q2 and that change among drives about 7 point swing in EPS growth versus prior year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Joseph Buckley", "Thank you. A question on China also I guess. So I think, Pat, you said the full-year guidance, the plus 3% to plus 7%, is intact, but you're thinking more the lower end. And I guess that seems curious to me with the first quarter coming in better than expected. So could you comment on that, and maybe at the same time address Pizza Hut? I guess I was a little surprised Pizza Hut was down as much as it was in the quarter. Just kind of the dynamics that are going on in that business would be helpful.", "Greg Creed", "Yes certainly. Well you may recall from our financial modeling session in December that we said we needed at least 3% same-store sales growth in China to achieve our China profit growth objectives consistent with delivering 10% EPS growth or better for all of Yum! So based on current trends we still fall within that range of 3% to 7%.", "We still have a big chunk of the year ahead of us, so it\u2019s always tough to call these things, but what I\u2019m suggesting is that it may be closer to lower end of the range than the higher end of the range but importantly we have a lot of confidence in the productivity initiatives the team delivered in Q1 and we believe that those will sustain through the balance of the year. So any relative softness in sales will be made up with better performance from a profit flow through perspective.", "And then quickly on Pizza Hut, as we said before Pizza Hut is recovering more strongly than KFC and that continues to be the case because KFC faced two supplier incidents in two years this is the first incident for Pizza Hut, so we are seeing the consumer metrics and the sales recover faster than at KFC. From a margin perspective, we posted 19% on the quarter. Pizza was actually to 20%.", "Joseph Buckley", "If I just go back to the first question, is there a reason that you were thinking the comp numbers would be at the low end given first quarter better than expectations in China?", "Pat Grismer", "Just as we read on the sales as we extrapolate them to the end of the year. Again it\u2019s always tough to estimate sales particularly at this point in the year particularly in a recovery environment, but if I have to make a call today, I would say that we are closer to that lower end however still gives us the momentum necessary to deliver the strong second half which is important to our ability to achieve at least 10% in EPS and still achieve the sequential improvement in quarter-on-quarter same-store sales.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner", "On the Taco Bell business the 6% comp you achieved there, was that relatively balanced I guess meaning did you see positive comps outside of your breakfast day part and on top of that what is breakfast mixing as percent of the business now?", "Pat Grismer", "Sure so the answer is yes we saw good bounce in the Taco Bell performance across all day part, so when you grow 6% same-store sales right even though the breakfast was still around 6%. It obviously means we\u2019re getting growth in breakfast, so we saw good consistent growth across all day parts. And I think that\u2019s because we\u2019ve got innovation which is clearly relevant to more than one day part. We\u2019ve got very disruptive advertising and I think all of that is working along with the improved customer service and continued great value. I think that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re delivering such a consistent performance.", "Brian Bittner", "In the mix?", "Pat Grismer", "The mix is 6% in the breakfast.", "Brian Bittner", "And just as quick [audio-gap] on Taco Bell I mean 37% operating profit growth is obviously really good and looks like there was just disciplined up and down in the P&L, but one thing that jumped out of me was the food margins and the 200 basis points you got there. What was going on there? Was that just breakfast being a better food margin business or did you see some commodity tailwinds?", "Pat Grismer", "Brian absolutely we have seen commodity tailwinds and that remains a source of upside for us for the full year. Again taking you back to where we were at in New York when we provided guidance around commodities, at the time we were expecting about 2% to 3% at Taco Bell. It\u2019s now looking like it\u2019s going to be flat, closer to flat and that\u2019s because what we\u2019re still expecting inflation in beef it\u2019s not going to be as extreme as we have thought.", "We\u2019re actually seeing higher deflation for cheese than we had originally expected and we\u2019re also seeing now deflation in chicken, so all of the things are working in our favor. At the same time, we got the benefit of pricing actions we took last year, so not a lot by way of new pricing actions but importantly roll over from last year when commodity cost had spiked. What makes me feel really good is that even with that significant pricing benefit versus the commodity inflation that we see today are value scores are actually getting stronger and I think it\u2019s because of the way the team has been very thoughtful and very intelligent around the way they\u2019ve taken pricing.", "They\u2019ve taken pricing when we\u2019ve introduced new innovation. They\u2019ve taken pricing when we\u2019ve offered new value on the menu and I think it\u2019s because of this discipline that they\u2019ve been able to strengthen their value scores and we feel very good about where things are at with margins today at Taco Bell.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Two questions, one just on the China maybe the broader industry perhaps, but just wondering the pace of the recovery obviously went to the second half that you seem pleased with that pace. I\u2019m just wondering whether you think that\u2019s consistent across the broader industry or maybe in your research any reason why perhaps your recovery as you\u2019ve noted in the past is maybe going slower than expected or maybe slower trajectory relative to peers I\u2019m just wondering what has kind of been called out in terms of why KFC might be seeing that slower than previously desired trajectory?", "Pat Grismer", "Jeff I think the answer is we\u2019ve said early the KFCs has not had one but two sequential incidents which we\u2019ve never experienced before I think that\u2019s I think one of the key underlying reasons why you may be seeing the KFC recovery though the good news is it is sequentially getting better maybe while the absolute recovery is taking a little longer. I think that really remains the key reason and that\u2019s the key thing we\u2019re seeing in all the work that we\u2019re doing in China.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "And if the AUVs I mean the goal \u2013 it sounds like the goal was obviously getting back to full strength, but for whatever reason they didn\u2019t get back to full strength is perhaps the recovery took longer and never got to full levels. Do you think it\u2019s reasonably to still get back to that kind of 20% plus restaurant margin or [indiscernible] the different way? What happened in \u201915 whether its comps, margins, returns what would lead you to maybe slow the store growth in \u201916 and beyond? Will it be if the comp thing get back to full strength or could you still grow at the 700 plus pace set out if you\u2019re still hitting that 20% margin?", "Pat Grismer", "Jeffrey there\u2019s no doubt in our mind that comps that same-store sales will return that is averaging along, it will return to where they will or where they were in 2012. It\u2019s not a question of if, it\u2019s just a question of when. That\u2019s not going to happen in 2015 and we\u2019ve never said that, but we remain very confident in our ability to continue to grow our sales layers and achieve the comps the AUVs that we had in 2012. With that then will come the improvement in margins and just as we\u2019ve seen margins hold up really well even under sales pressure we know that when the sales come back there\u2019s enormous operating leverage in our business. And so I remain confident that we will get back 20%. It\u2019s tough to say exactly when that\u2019s going to happen, but as from where I sit that remains a reasonable expectation for that business in the mid-term.", "Greg Creed", "Jeff I just think we\u2019re a brand building company and every day each one of our brands in 126 countries we operate is really focused on four things. Making our brands more relevant, making them more engaged, making them all connected and demonstrating that we care. And I think if we follow that philosophy on all of our brands in every country in which we operate, we will continue to see strong same-store sales growth across the business.", "Pat Grismer", "And Jeffrey what I would also point out is that when we look and we share these numbers before and we look at the top 10% of our KFC restaurants in China, we see average unit volumes that are well above 2 million close to $2.5 million or more. That compares very favorably to what McDonald\u2019s has achieved by way of global average unit volumes so versus where we stand today there\u2019s nothing but upside and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re not only going to get back to where AUVs were in 2012, we\u2019re going to shoot beyond that. Again it\u2019s tough to say exactly when that\u2019s going to happen, but we do have strong belief in our ability to rebuild sales and to bring with that the restaurant level margin importantly reinforced by all the great work the team has done to drive significant productivity improvement during the period of sale softness.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse", "Actually a question on Pizza Hut, is the comment about working on sort of better value construct for the brand. How should we think about the reasoning behind that, has there been an issue with value scores deteriorating, changes in competitive intensity or maybe the thought process is using more aggressive value as a way to sort of induce trial of the new flavor of new menu?", "Pat Grismer", "I think the answer is that we \u2013 an analysis about performance is just we just went value competitive in the marketplace whether that was entry price point whether that was single pizzas whether it was pays, so we clearly have a lot of work to do. What I\u2019m excited about is that the team with franchisees we\u2019ve had a value summit in the last couple of weeks. We\u2019ve shared all the information and all of our knowledge around that value positioning and what we have to do and I think what you\u2019ll see is us come out aligned as one system in order to make a stronger value statement in the marketplace.", "Karen Holthouse", "And with sort of that just as a quick follow up is there a particular price point you\u2019re focused on and is it going for I think that more as an entry level price point or some sort of bundled value that you need to go after?", "Pat Grismer", "I think the answer is all of the above. We have to have good entry level price points. We have to have good single pizzas. We have to have good pan pizzas and we have to have good abundant value and I think we can and will do much better across all of those elements of the price value equation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles", "Pat you talked about the China pricing schedule for the year, it sounds like you had some price benefit in 1Q and you\u2019re now aiming for 3% price at the high end where you got to be analyst a put guidance for the low end of 3% to 7% China same-store sales. Is the situation still fluid enough that you\u2019ll consider holding back on pricing in favor of traffic?", "Pat Grismer", "Well we\u2019re always very thoughtful around pricing in much the same way I just want Taco Bell thinking very carefully around when we\u2019re introducing innovation and making sure that we protect value on the menu as we have done in our China business, for KFC in China we had about 3% of total pricing in the quarter, 2% of that was roll over from last year. Now we took an incremental of 2% pricing action in the middle of January which yielded about 1% of pricing benefit on the quarter. We continue to maintain the value and of course we see no reason to take significant incremental pricing actions beyond this probably the situation based on helping the trending in the business in very sensitive the value of course and the importance of value to regaining traction with consumers.", "On the Pizza Hut side we took 2 and 2.5% of pricing in late 2014, so we have the roll over effective that of planning out in Q1. There again just being very sensitive to what things are ever brand, looking at future pricing actions potentially time to the introduction of new product innovation and maintaining those strong value and goes on the menu.", "Andrew Charles", "That\u2019s helpful and then Greg the spring menu revamp. How would you classify the price points the more value and should be value oriented, the premium price, the mix, just any thoughts there?", "Greg Creed", "When you go any products across the menu it\u2019s a combination as we said earlier. So there is product for lunch and dinner. It\u2019s a cross variant price points and what I like is that I think the presentation of these products and the position of these product is really good having a chance to do it. So it\u2019s not one particular focus.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Jason West", "Thanks. I have just two questions. One on the outlook for the year, you guys still assuming flat KFC profits in China in the guidance and then secondly with the cost savings that you realized in the first quarter which I think surprised some of us. Is that a new round of productivity initiatives that have now kicked in or is that sort of a continuation of the productivity that you guys more [comp/count] for a while and if you talk about how that extends into the rest of the year. Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "I\u2019ll address the second question first and then come back to the outlook for the full year. On the margin front one of the things I love about our China team is that they have a mindset of continuous improvement. So as you know they made extraordinary progress on restaurant level productivity in the middle of 2013 and the early part of 2014, all of those of initiatives and the associated margin benefit have sustained into 2015. But they are coming over the top of that with some new productivity initiatives which proves instrumental to their ability to deliver the better than expected margin performance in the first quarter. In the early three elements to this, the first is with respect to what we call pace setter analysis which is essentially benchmarking the best team labor performance within the specific sales band each one of our brands they moved out from an annual discipline to a quarterly discipline and they set targets accordingly after having conducted market test to ensure that there was no impact to the customer experience. So effectively through that more [regular/vigorous] approach to labor planning. They were able to tighten the labor schedules in a way that ensure that we continue to meet customer expectations. But they do it a lot more efficiently.", "Second piece was around the mix of student and part time team members. So they increase the mix and that delivered a benefit to labor in the quarter and that sustained balance of the year and then the third which is taking [hard/how] to look at management staffing levels in the context that our sales were out and adjusting plans and managing to that. So again three elements to the work they did this quarter which we sustaining through the balance for the year.", "Greg Creed", "I just wanted to reinforce one point to Pat made. This productivity has not been at the expense of the customer experience. I think it\u2019s very important that we do continually monitor the customer experience as we go through this process and I\u2019m really happy with. The customer experience is actually growing slightly bigger, effective making productivity improvements and so I think overall it\u2019s well for the future.", "Pat Grismer", "And maybe the last one I would make on it is that the combined effect of these new productivity initiatives contributed about 1 to 2 points of margin improvement versus prior year and again we see that sustaining do to the end of the year. Now the first question you asked Jason was about our outlook for China profit and the extent to which we\u2019re assuming some profit improvement at KFC. We\u2019re assuming that KFC will improve profits this year that is working in our full year outlook for EPS growth and when you added all up in conjunction with in order to expecting the other divisions and even with this stronger than expected headwind from foreign exchange we get to at least 10% EPS growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Senatore", "Thank you. I have a question and then a follow up on your commentary if I may. The question is about unit growth in China and I think that\u2019s always been we keep Yen always in terms of value accretion. It looks like the store closure has certainly come down. I was just wondering if when you think about that 700 growth and looking at kind of what the net through the net would look like. Is it safe to say that you kind of pass the point where you\u2019ve closed all of that kind of low performing stores and I guess can you give us a sense of what their returns on the new stores are looking like now and what the mix is between tier I and II versus lower tier cities?", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly Sara, so first starting with closures, we had a higher to normal level of closures last year for China division beat by [indiscernible]. So it\u2019s we were consolidating these states, there was significant impact to the unit count in China. Most of that is now behind us and so when you look at our core brands actually closures in 2014 were lower than they were in 2013 and we expect 2015 to be below 2014, there will always be closures in a restaurant business the size of ours. But we do see that moderating.", "And then in terms of the returns we\u2019re very pleased with the returns we\u2019re seeing on our new unit investments as you know we continued to shift the mix of development down to the lower tier cities for KFC and then more probably the Pizza Hut given the relative strength of the Pizza the economic model, so here are couples of start they could help with that, so for KFC in the first quarter 67% of our new units openings were in tier 3 and below cities and that compared to 53% for the entire year of 2012. So, quite a significant shift there and then for Pizza casual dining business for the first quarter that brand accounted for 35% of total division unit openings and that compares to 24% for 2012. So again you can see the shifts that are happening in our portfolio and all of that is formed by our discipline around where we direct our capital. We did redeploy capital to the higher return opportunities that\u2019s been good discipline in China over the years and we\u2019re continuing to move in that direction and so that gives us confidence in the continued investment or making in that business and I would say is related to 700 that we\u2019re expecting this year. There is every reason to believe over the long run as our business grows to that number will hedge higher, back in 2012 we opened nearly 900 units. So we certainly have the capacity and we\u2019ve unmatched capability to do it, for us it\u2019s all about being great discipline not getting too far ahead of ourselves and making sure that our capital is deployed to the highest return opportunities.", "Sara Senatore", "Great, thank you and just a follow up I had for Greg actually was idea of these best practices during he talked about in China. I think one in the, I\u2019m sure concerns you\u2019ve heard is the idea that with the portfolio brand maybe the all that many benefits to have altogether they should be run separately so, can you maybe give an example or talk about what kinds of that best practices can be shared across different brands that where you couldn\u2019t get the benefit of just looking internally within one brand and at the highest performance within that brand?", "Greg Creed", "Sure, Sara. I\u2019ll give you the specific example of the China there are six people that we took, 3 of them worked with KFC outside of China but 3 of them work to Taco bell and I think the Taco bell team included people who are very strong in advertising, product positioning, digital and social mobile and that\u2019s where we think Taco bell probably excels. So I think our ability to take people not just from within the brand or within the geography but across brand and across geography is something that is particularly unique beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe", "I wanted to follow up on the labor I guess what we talk about this labor efficiency in China. There has been basically 3 years of reduced not just labor dollars per store but labor hours per store more specifically and can you help us understand what productivity means and is it, kind of tightening up the number of hours the given employee works I mean is it kitchen labor, is it front of house labor, is it in the number of managers that you use, maybe it\u2019s even the number of managers that you have in training. Just you kind of put some structure process in terms of exactly what efficiency means and why it is the right thing for the brand in a recovery and I have a follow up as well.", "Pat Grismer", "John, you clearly understand our business very well because everything you mentioned for once part, what the team has done to drive year on year improvement and labor productivity. And as I said before one of the thing we love about the team is that they have a continuous improvement mindset, we continually help them as the best operating team we have anywhere in the world and they continue to take it to the next level. So, they are managing to tighter schedule but that schedule is fully uniformed by us I mentioned more frequent updates to their pay setter analysis and taking it to a full market testing.", "So we have a confidence as Greg mentioned before that we are not doing this to an extent that is going to adversely impact the customer experience. But at the same time, the team continues to reengineer the back-half. So they have a team of very skilled engineers who look at equipment lab, who look at how labor is deployed behind the front counter to better accommodate \u2013 the lines that develop at a restaurant at lunch and dinner time more cost effectively. So there is a lot of intelligence and thought and rigger that is applied to how we do this but it is that continues improvement mindset that is really at the hard at all.", "John Ivankoe", "Thank you for that. And secondly the performance of the brands tier 1 and 2 versus tiers 3 through 6 and I was hoping that you could elaborate on some of the increased competition that you have seen across the markets whether that\u2019s continuing in this current economy where you might be encouraging people to open less stores and in others words lessening some of the competitive impact.", "Pat Grismer", "The trend continued to show competition intensifying in the higher tier cities, so that\u2019s no change from before but interestingly and this is consistent with what we have said in our Q4 earnings call. We are seeing better recovery, we are seeing actually stronger sales to our sales performance of those tier 1 cities, relative to the lower tier cities, so that trends has persisted.", "John Ivankoe", "And still the development tilt towards 3 to 6 what does that tell you in terms of, does that make sense to shift development or is tier 3 and tier 6 that where you want to be putting a new footprint?", "Pat Grismer", "It absolutely make sense to continue to pivot towards the lower tier cities for two reasons, first of all there is more opportunity because those markets are less penetrated and we have the ability unlike competitors to move quickly and gain at that first mover advantage and then secondly there is this superior cost structure, where labor and rent cost are lower in the lower tier cities. Therefore the sales hurdles are lower and therefore we get higher returns on investment because remember we are getting the same AUVs \u2013 average unit volumes in lower tier cities as we are in the higher tier cities so we get the same sales volume but with the higher margin and with the similar investment. So the returns are superior and there are more opportunities out there because those cities are more rapidly developing and they are less heavily penetrated.", "Greg Creed", "Just to further built on that, they know how sharing. I think the labor productivity is an another example where we share labor productivity around the world. So as you probably know we have some pretty high labor markets, Australia and UK and we are able to share those earnings on like transactions per labor hour and obviously share that best practice not just around but all around the world and again not just with in KFC but all the other brands. So I think the labor productivity is another example of the paradigm.", "Operator", "We have question from R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy", "Thanks. Just had a quick question about the KFC segment, I really have two questions, first is just kind of, give us some examples of what is driving that that strong 7% sensor sales growth and expectations going forward and then secondly just a little bit more color on the new franchise agreement that you have in place just in terms of the 100 million of the 185 million in terms of the timing of that investment and more importantly when you start of the some of the benefits from the marketing and the re-imaging capacity that you are going to bake into that investment program?", "Greg Creed", "I think the success has been, [indiscernible] and what we have done we stayed on as far other box and traditionally at KFC we tend to have, our sandwich promotions that we got in the markets and the challenge is as you put, it doesn\u2019t matter how many people\u2014out of the eat out of the $20 bundle it\u2019s still $20 on the television and I think what the team has learned and its really stay rigorously on is the fact on the box. So now we have about four different versions of it, so there is obviously variety that we can offer the customer and also enables to come back with different insights and new communications but I think the consistency of staying around is really powerful entry price point has really been one of the key of success a KFC in the U.S.", "Pat Grismer", "And then on the agreement we have reached with our U.S. franchises in the financials around that, $185 million in total, most of that being recorded as a special items, the advertising piece which amounts about $20 million per year about $10 million or so is going to fall into 2015 that will flow through regular operating income and that is reflected in our guidance still of at least 10% EPS growth this year. ", "In terms of the benefits, this is a multi-year program, so we expected that the benefits will accrue over the long term as well and we expect to see benefits from each element of that program. So we do expect sales to be better with the incremental advertising. We do expect to see sales lift from the incentive that we are offering to accelerate the pace of remodels such that 70% of our KFC which stable will be a current image by 2017 and that we are expecting to see sales left from the investments we are making for franchises in new equipment which puts them in a position not only to offer the more contemporary menu but to do so in a fashion that provides a better customer experience with better reliability and there will a sales benefit associated with that and we expect that will built over the time and that\u2019s the underlying business case here. The size of the investment for a business of KFC U.S. size but we do expect to see the value that business improve significantly on the back of these investments and with the outstanding brands strategies that Jason Market and his team have put in place.", "Greg Creed", "So, I thank everybody for being on the call. I know today is a very busy day with a lot of restaurants releasing earnings. So that you took the time to be with us, we really appreciate. I just want to reiterate that we believe that we are well set to deliver at least 10% EPS growth not only in 2015 but beyond. Thanks for being with us today.

Brands Second Quarter 2015 Earnings and Conference Call.", "All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.", "Steve Schmitt, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Jona. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from Greg and Pat, we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Before we get started I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.", "All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the YUM! Brands website at yum.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today's call.", "We are broadcasting this conference call via our website.

Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of this recording.", "Finally, we would like to make you aware of the following upcoming YUM! Investor Event. Our third quarter earnings will be released on Tuesday, October, 6.", "And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed", "Thank you Steve and good morning everyone. As you saw in our release yesterday, EPS in the second quarter while below prior year exceeded our original expectations. I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made and have every reason to believe we\u2019ll deliver a strong second half and full year EPS of at least 10%.", "Overall, I would summarize our second quarter performance as very similar to our first quarter results. Taco Bell is firing on all cylinders; KFC delivered another solid quarter; China continues to improve and while we are making progress, there is still much work to be done at Pizza Hut.", "Let\u2019s start today\u2019s discussion with China. Same store sales continue to show steady but slower than expected progress. This quarter\u2019s 10% decline marks an improvement from the 12% decline last quarter despite a more difficult overlap.", "There is no doubt in my mind that we will make a full recovery over the long term and return to historic average unit volumes. We have the two strongest brands in China by a wide margin, but frankly the recovery is taking longer than we would like. We need to be more aggressive, more innovative and much more disruptive to step change the business.", "I\u2019ve challenged the China team to do all these things with a sense of urgency, because we know that when we step up our performance in China, our brands perform. So to be clear, we are 100% committed to not only recovering but growing our unit volumes in China. With overall customer metrics trending up we know we can achieve this, by sharpening our communications and bringing new excitement to our menu. We\u2019ve learnt from experience that we must innovate our way to recovery and that\u2019s just what we are going to do.", "To this point in the second quarter we launched the first of two menu revamps at KFC. This consisted of eight new products focused on lunch and dinner. In addition to the traditional KFC offerings, this revamp included products aimed at consumers interested in healthy alternatives such as herbal tea and seafood.", "We also recently launched our second menu revamp focused on breakfast. We know breakfast is an under developed day part for us in China comprising about 7% of sales. These two menu revamps provide new products throughout the day and give us a one, two punch of innovation we know our customers will love.", "Additionally we continue to rollout our premium coffee. As of quarter end we offered our coffee in over 2,000 stores, providing an incremental sales lift of about a point for the stores offering coffee. The key to success in this business is grow existing or create new sales layers to build on. We\u2019re excited that premium coffee is already driving sales and profits, while giving us another platform to grow from going forward.", "We\u2019re also making progress with digital marketing and our online delivery platform. We believe these initiatives make KFC even more contemporary maintaining a high degree of relevance to the Chinese consumer. In short, the KFC business we are building back will be based on new product innovation and balance nicely with everyday value anchors. We are continuing down the path to make KFC even more useful and contemporary. All of this is part of making China\u2019s number one foreign brand even more relevant going forward in an increasingly competitive market.", "At Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China we continue to expand units at a high pace with great returns. Same store sales declined 4% in the quarter, but this marks an improvement from our first quarter performance and the brand is positioned for a strong second half.", "We continue to leverage the asset throughout the day with the rollout of breakfast and our expansion into late night. We are also excited about Pizza Hut home service offering where we have nearly 300 units in China. Anyway you look at it; Pizza Hut in China has a long runway for growth ahead.", "In conclusion, we are making continued progress in China and remain bullish on our long term prospects there. With cash paybacks of about 3 years, we are confidently investing in new unit expansion. We have leading brands and an enviable competitive position in the world\u2019s fastest growing economy. We expect to open 700 new units in China this year, and believe we can substantially expand our footprint over time.", "Moving on to our KFC division, I am pleased to report the division continued to produce solid results. Same store sales grew 3% and the division opened 122 new international restaurants in 39 countries. Nearly 75% of these new restaurants were opened in emerging markets.", "I\u2019m particularly pleased with the impressive growth we continue to see out of Russia where same store sales grew 14%. I travelled to Russia in May and I have to tell you, this is one of the most impressive teams we have anywhere in the world. The combination of brand positioning, operational excellence and product innovation gives me confidence that we will continue to win in this important market.", "In developed markets, the UK and Australia once again posted impressive results with excellent same store sales growth. This is evidence that our KFC brand can deliver remarkable results in both emerging, as well as developed markets. I believe we can apply the same strategy such as breakthrough product innovation, compelling value and world class operations, which are propelling these businesses to other developed markets. Just think how our results would be transformed if we could achieve Australia\u2019s 2.3 million average unit volumes in all of our markets.", "Now turning to the Pizza Hut division; same store sales were even in the quarter, but trends in the U.S. sales improved across the quarter. We complemented our innovation focus with compelling value offerings such as any medium pairs for $6.99 and the $12.99 Big Dipper Pizza, which provided momentum.", "We also continue to make strides around driving more digital sales. For example, home meal replacement digital orders were 42% up 10 percentage points from the second quarter of 2014. As we discussed last quarter, we are working to attract new millennial customers with our Flavor of Now menu, while also providing our loyal mainstream customers with their favorites. I firmly believe Pizza Hut has enormous potential that recent results do not reflect.", "We are intently working to become more competitive. Turning around these results will not happen overnight, but through our focus on value, our assets, digital and messaging, we are relentlessly working on realizing the full potential of our brand. We are encouraged that Pizza at international continues to develop at a high rate and we expect record international expansion this year, laying the groundwork for future growth.", "Last but not least, Taco Bell. I am very pleased with the results out of the division this quarter. Same store sales grew 6%, operating profit increased 29% and we opened 58 new restaurants. Keep in mind we launched breakfast at Taco Bell in the second quarter of 2014. So this marks that first quarter we are lapping breakfast. With breakfast at 7% of mix, restaurant margin exceeding 20% and a flourishing innovation pipeline, I am confident that we\u2019ll see continued positive momentum going forward.", "Taco Bell\u2019s goal is to be America\u2019s favorite millennial brand and we are making substantial strides to deliver on that aspiration. For example, we just announced we are expanding our delivery testing with DoorDash in select locations. I\u2019m delighted with the strong initial test results and this is just another example of Taco Bell proving it is on the cutting edge of QSR.", "Taco Bell International continues to build awareness and improve its economic model. Same store sales grew 7% in the quarter with particularly strong performance in Latin America and Canada. We have now opened 18 new restaurants this year, including four with open kitchen formats. We are still in the first innings of international expansion for Taco Bell, but I know that this one day will become our third global brand.", "So in conclusion, we have multiple opportunities for growth across each YUM! division. We are making continued progress in China. Taco Bell is going from strength to strength. KFC continues to build on its momentum and Pizza Hut is in turnaround mode.", "I could not be more thrilled to lead this company into the next phase of growth. Our brand building agenda led by consumer insights is underway in driving our brand and product position. As I mentioned last call, we recently acquired the Collider Lab to help elevate this agenda. I\u2019m especially pleased with how Kaleida has intergraded its thinking into each brand to improve our insight driven marketing.", "I am also pleased that Pizza Hut team has added expertise in big data analytics. This is allowing the brand to segment customers in ways we\u2019ve not done before that should lead to more effecting marketing going forward and in a true the YUM! fashion, we are planning to spread this knowhow throughout the organization.", "Since assuming my current role I\u2019ve been on the road visiting many of our international markets. To say I like what I\u2019ve seen would be an understatement. I\u2019ve walked away from each visit grateful that I\u2019ve inherited such a strong business with great franchise partners, fantastic leaders and the potential for enormous growth. Of course everywhere I go I see opportunities to improve our company, but I\u2019m confident that our band building focus combined with the technology innovation, marketing and operation efforts underway will help unlock this potential.", "Now some of you may want to ask today about our views around corporate structuring related to our China division, including a shareholder suggestion that was well publicized this quarter. We don\u2019t plan to discuss that and distract from our second quarter results. But we want you to know this, the YUM! Board of Directors regularly review strategic options to optimizing long term shareholder value, including those involving corporate structure. We routinely dialog with shareholders, listen to their ideas and thoroughly evaluate those, which maybe in our shareholders\u2019 best interest.", "In any event, our top priority is to get our China business back on track and we are making steady progress as evidenced by our first and second quarter results. As we\u2019ve discussed, we expect to have a strong second half of the year based on continued progress in China and fully expect YUM! to deliver at least 10% EPS growth in 2015.", "In summary, we are in a unique position at YUM! with three distinct brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused the three keys to driving shareholder value; same store sales growth, new unit development and generating high returns on invested capital. I believe this combination of efforts will enable us to reestablish our track record of consistently delivering double digit EPS growth in 2015 and the years ahead.", "And with that, I\u2019ll now turn things over to Pat.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you Greg and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our second quarter results and share perspective on our full year outlook. For the second quarter as Greg mentioned, our results were very similar to Q1. Earnings per share excluding special items decreased 5%. This was substantially better than the decline we had originally estimated.", "I\u2019m pleased with the quality of this upside as it was led by better than expected restaurant margins at KFC China and outstanding sales and margin performance at Taco Bell. With the continued progress we are expecting in China, we remain confident that we\u2019ll have a strong second half and deliver at least 10% EPS growth this year.", "Reported EPS declined 28% in the quarter. This includes a $68 million non-cash special item charge related to our decision to sell Mexico real-estate, negatively impacting reported EPS by $0.13 in the quarter. This item reduced our ex special tax rate by approximately 2 percentage points benefiting ex special EPS growth by 3 percentage points this quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to provide some color on our second quarter results by division. In China operating profit declined 25% prior to foreign currency translation, led by a same store sales decrease of 10%, which was sequentially better than Q1\u2019s performance despite a more challenging lap. Restaurant margins were 14.6% in a seasonally low quarter. This was 2.2 percentage points lower than last year\u2019s Q2, yet it was a significant improvement from the 4.5 percentage point decline we saw in the first quarter demonstrating continued progress. The margin decline resulted from transaction deleverage and inflation, partially offset by pricing and labor productivity.", "Our team in China continued to do an outstanding job of driving restaurant operating efficiency through our improved store level sales forecasting and better labor scheduling. Importantly they accomplished this while maintaining our high standards of customer service. This continues to bolster our belief that China division restaurant margins will return to the 20% range as sales recover and that this recovery has the potential to unlock approximately $600 million of operating profit from our existing store base alone.", "In addition to the profit leverage we will realize as sales recover, we continue to open new units with confidence, which is a key driver of future growth. We opened 80 new restaurants in the second quarter bringing our first half total to 251 new units in China. We continue to shift our new unit development towards higher return investments, as we are more selective in Tier I and Tier II cities and continue to upweight development in Tier III through Tier VI cities.", "Similarly we continue to shift more of our new unit development to Pizza Casual Dining, which generates our strongest returns in China. Based on the results we are seeing in these new restaurants, we are confident that these investments will yield strong returns and we remain on target to open 700 new restaurants this year.", "Now moving to our KFC Global division which posted another solid quarter with growth in sales, margin and profit. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets, up 12% before foreign exchange led by Russia, Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth, up 5% before foreign exchange led by Australia, the UK and Western Europe. And KFC in the U.S. delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of solid same-store sales growth with comps up 3%.", "Division operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points in the quarter to 21.9%, driven by same store sales growth, franchise led new unit development and stronger restaurant level margins across the board. And while increased advertising expense related to our ongoing U.S. turnaround program impacted the divisions profit by 2 percentage points in the quarter, KFC global\u2019s operating profit still grew 10% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.", "An important element of this is robust franchise led international development as KFC opened 122 new international restaurants in the quarter and is on pace to set a new record this year opening 700 new international restaurants outside of China and India, including a recent new market opening in Myanmar, demonstrating the strength and broad appeal of this iconic global brand.", "Same store sales were even for our Pizza Hut Global division with growth of 2% in emerging markets and 1% in the U.S. and a decline of 2% in international developed markets. Division operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 22.6% as strategic growth investments in international G&A offset improved restaurant margins which benefited from lower cheese costs. While sales were even with last year and short of expectations, we are confident we are making the right investments to improve Pizza Hut\u2019s overall brand position operations and digital experience globally.", "New unit development continues to be a bright spot for Pizza Hut as the division opened 101 new restaurants in the second quarter, including 66 new international restaurants. Franchisees opened 92% of these new international units underscoring their confidence in the brand. We are confident we will have another year of record development with about 550 new international restaurants in 2015.", "And finally, Taco Bell posted another exceptionally strong quarter with same store sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin of 23%, which is more than 5 points better than Q2 of last year. As a result, operating margin increased 4.7 percentage points to 29.5% lifting operating profit by 29% versus prior year. We could not be more pleased with the performance of our Taco Bell team and their continued focus on category leading innovation across every aspect of their business.", "This obviously includes our new breakfast layer increased to a very healthy 7% sales mix. Additionally we opened 58 new restaurants in the second quarter with nearly 90% opened by franchisees and are well on our way to opening at least 150 net new restaurants this year with international development accelerating in the years to come. Anyway you look at it, Taco Bell is a powerhouse brand with outstanding momentum.", "Now I\u2019d like to shift gears and talk about our full year outlook. We fully expect to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% this year. Given our first half EPS decline of 7%, we\u2019ll need nearly 30% EPS growth in the second half of the year to reach this target. We believe this is achievable. The key to this EPS bounce back is a sales recovery in China and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll deliver solidly positive sales numbers going forward, especially as we lap the supplier incident from July 20 of last year.", "I\u2019m extremely confident that as sales return, profits will flow through nicely, given the continuous cost management initiatives we\u2019ve seen through our first half. With first half China restaurant margin already over 16%, we now expect full year restaurant margin to be closer to 17%. As a reminder, 60% of China\u2019s operating profit historically is earned in the second half of their fiscal year, which includes seven of 12 months.", "Outside of China we expect KFC to have another solid year and Pizza Hut to fall well short of its ongoing growth target despite the improving results we expect in the balance of the year. For Taco Bell, although we expect solid performance in the balance of the year, we expect much more moderate profit growth as we overlap stronger sales and margin performance from last year.", "I do want to point out foreign currency translation remains a strong headwind as we continue to expect this to impact full year EPS by about 5 percentage points. However, this impact is included in our EPS forecast of at least 10% growth. To be clear, this exposure is one of the profit translations and does not impact our ability to price our products competitively around the world.", "So if you step back and think about how 2015 is developing, it\u2019s very consistent with our expectation coming into the year, which is a negative first half followed by a very strong second half driven by China and importantly, we continue to invest behind the business, opening 2,100 new international restaurants in 2015. Outside of China approximately 90% of our new units will be opened by our franchise partners.", "So let me wrap things up. We\u2019re pleased that our second quarter results were stronger than expected due to robust performance at Taco Bell, as well as the continued recovery in China. We expect at least 10% EPS growth this year with a very strong second half.", "And with that, I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Tarantino with R. W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino", "Hi, good morning. My question is on the China sales recovery and I guess first part is how would you frame up your current expectation for comps for the year now. I think last quarter your point was the low end of your 3% to 7% guidance. So I just wanted to understand what you\u2019re thinking now and then specifically you mentioned that the recovery is going I guess slower than expected. So could you talk about maybe why you think that\u2019s the case and whether you think its macro related or more specific to the brand metrics that you\u2019re seeing?", "Pat Grismer", "David, this is Pat. I\u2019ll take the first part of your question and Greg will respond to the second part. So as to our expectations for full year, same store sales growth in China, at this stage of the year it still remains difficult to call. We\u2019ll certainly keep you updated as the year progresses, but certainly based on everything we\u2019ve seen to date and our forecast balance of the year, full year same store sales growth in China could be in the low single digits.", "We do expect both KFC and Pizza Hut same store sales growth to turn strongly positive as we lap the initial impact of the OSI publicity later this month. This will fuel a strong second half for China and enable us to deliver EPS growth of at least 10% for the year.", "Now I\u2019d also point out that from a profit perspective stronger than expected margin performance has offset the impact of the slower than expected sales recovery in China and we expect that this will continue through the balance of the year, thereby preserving our overall profit outlook.", "Greg Creed", "So David, let me answer the second part of that question. I think the good news is that sales are recovering. We went from minus 12 to minus 10 despite a more difficult lap of plus 15. The good news is that the consumer metrics are improving trending in the right direction. As always, these are never linear unfortunately, but we do know that we compare this to previous recoveries. We\u2019re going in the right direction, making progress across the board. So I feel good and we remain obviously bullish on China. We continue to invest in China and I think as you know, these customer metrics are the harbinger of future sales performance. So I think with all that said, we remain very bullish and confident and continue to invest.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks David. Next question please Jona.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe", "Thank you very much. A follow up on that and then maybe an addition as well. Could you diagnose why specifically you think China was below your own expectations in the second quarter, especially given the customer metrics which have been trending up throughout the year?", "And secondly, it is clear that with it being a little bit below your expectations and perhaps a tweak down in the comps in China for 2015, it is interesting to juxtapose that with the China margin numbers going up. So just a philosophical question is, why not reinvest some of that margin to regain the traffic or in other words, how confident are you that the focus on margin is in a reason in and of itself why comps might be slightly below expectations.", "Greg Creed", "Yes, I think the slower than expected recovery \u2013 remember we\u2019ve had two safety issues, which we\u2019ve never had before alright, so we\u2019ve never been able to model two safety issues and there\u2019s obviously some slowness in recovering that. But there\u2019s been no impact on our customer metrics as we measure from an operating point of view and so I think in that sense we are going to continue to push aggressively.", "We need to be more innovative and the way I look at it is, with where we are today, Pat\u2019s giving you the right guidance, but we\u2019ve still got six months of the year to go and right now what I\u2019m trying to do is aggressively bring outside ideas from YUM! into China. As we said earlier, we\u2019ve got really a number of that KFC businesses on file, whether that\u2019s Russia, the UK, Australia or South Africa and I think there\u2019s a number of product innovations, there\u2019s a number of valued plays that those markets have played and I\u2019m very confident that we can bring those to bear.", "And that said, I still expect a strong second half in China. Sales will go positive, we will continue to make progress and I think we can bring the power of YUM! to bear by taking those ideas from those powerhouse countries and have China test those.", "Pat Grismer", "And John, this is Pat. I\u2019ll just add a couple of other comments, which is that we feel very good about the productivity gains that the team has made in China. We believe that they are sustainable as Greg mentioned. They\u2019ve not impacted customer service levels and frankly what they\u2019ve effectively done is strengthen the underlying unit level economics, which not only gives us continued confidence to invest at the rate that we are behind new unit development, but also reinforces our belief that as sales recovers that we\u2019ll see significant profit leverage in the business.", "Greg Creed", "Yes, I mean if I was to make one last comment I\u2019d say we need to balance value with innovation and there is no doubt innovating our way out of this is the best way to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to stay focused on.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks John. Jona, our next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass", "Thanks. Good morning. First on China comps, yes so the recent decline in the Chinese stock market had any impact on sales. Do you notice a correlation there at all?", "Pat Grismer", "We don\u2019t. John, this is Pat. John we don\u2019t see a correlation. We think actually a very small percentage of customers have been impacted by that as to whether or not it is impacted broader consumer confidence, we have no reason to believe it at this stage if that is the case.", "John Glass", "Greg, if I could ask one more. Greg, you did open up and you talked about the possibility of this China spin notion. I know you don\u2019t want it to be a distraction. Do you view that as a distraction in and of itself for the recovery of China, so that you might want to wait till China recovers before entertaining that idea?", "Greg Creed", "I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we don\u2019t want to talk about it. Obviously we review our shareholder proposals, but I can assure you the China team is focused on one thing; their number one priority and my number one priority is getting China sales back into sort of stronger growth.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks John. Jona the next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Diane Geissler with CLSA. Your line is open.", "Diane Geissler", "Good morning.", "Greg Creed", "Good morning.", "Diane Geissler", "So is it safe to assume that you've kept your guidance for the full year at at least 10% EPS growth because of the uncertainty around the China comp. Is that the biggest holdback despite the fact that the margin is so much better than you expected. And then also \u2013 I\u2019m going to let you answer that first.", "Pat Grismer", "Hi Diana. This is Pat. Happy to respond to that question. I think what your implying is that maybe the full year guidance is conservative and I would say absolutely not and I do want to put it in perspective, because you have to bear in mind that we\u2019re at that midpoint of our year. EPS is down 7% and as I said in my prepared remarks earlier, to achieve full year growth of at least 10%, EPS needs to grow nearly 30% in the second half of the year and I don\u2019t think of that as an overly conservative number.", "Obviously it's heavily dependent on the results of our China division where profits were down about 30% in the first half of the year, and in order for China to deliver on its expected share of second half EPS growth, second half profits there need to be more than double of what they were last year. But we\u2019re confident China can deliver this result, but with 60% of their profits being generated in the second half, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s prudent to adopt a more aggressive stance and lean in on this.", "Additionally as I mentioned, foreign exchange headwinds are much stronger than we had originally estimated, but this is factored into our overall EPS guidance. So I just want to make it very clear, we expect to have a strong second half based on continued progress in China and we fully expect to deliver at least 10% EPS growth for the year.", "Diane Geissler", "Okay, thank you and then I wanted to ask on the comments about the new unit mix leaning more heavily on lower tier cities and also into the Pizza Hut franchise and home delivery. Can you talk a little bit about your development expectations for this year and even into next year in terms of what we should be thinking about KFC versus Pizza Hut versus Pizza Hut Home Delivery and then higher tier cities versus lower tier cities? Just trying to kind of frame that up.", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly Diane. As I mentioned, our capital investment follows returns and so where we generate the higher returns is where we\u2019re directing more of our capital spending. That has been the case for the last few years and just to put it in perspective, for the quarter 60% or 62% of KFC new unit openings were in Tier III and below cities. Back in 2012 that number was 53%. So you\u2019ve seen a pretty significant shift there and then as it relates to Pizza Hut Casual Dining for the quarter, that business accounted for 35% of total division new unit openings. In 2012 that number was 24%. You can expect that those trends will continue, because again that\u2019s where we see the stronger returns and our capital investment will follow the returns.", "I\u2019m not going to give preliminary guidance for 2016 as it relates to either number of units or the mix of units, but I will tell you that we\u2019ll continue to direct more of our capital investment money towards the higher return opportunities, which at the moment are with Pizza Casual Dining and for the KFC business in the lower tier cities.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Diane.", "Diane Geissler", "Thank you.", "Pat Grismer", "Next question please Jona.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Palmer, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "David Palmer", "Thanks. Could we talk a little bit about the marketing and menu news from China in particular and how do you think that new menu is performing at KFC China and any data points would be helpful with the impact to your marketing, even as we look into 3Q. Thanks.", "Greg Creed", "Yes, I think as we said David, obviously we saw sequential improvement from minus 12 to minus 10. The new menu items are accounting for that 15% of sales, so they certainly got traction with the customers. I think that\u2019s also another good data point and I think the consumer metrics continue to show improvement. So I think you look at our continuous improvement. You look at the percentage of mix from these new items and you look at the continued improvement in our consumer metrics and I think that all bodes well. As Pat has said that we will have a strong second half. We will go into positive same store sales growth and I remain completely confident.", "Now can we take ideas from around the world between now and the end of the year and test those? Yes. Do I still have the sense of urgency? Yes. Could we do things more speedy? Yes. So as you probably expect, that\u2019s occurring and that\u2019s why we\u2019re at the half year mark and there\u2019s still plenty of time for us to still evolve and tinker with the calendar between now and the end of the year.", "David Palmer", "Is there anything specific that you learned that you think weren\u2019t tweaking that you could call out from the first half; things that worked and didn\u2019t work?", "Greg Creed", "The other way I look at it, there\u2019s some great products outside of China that are doing very well, whether it\u2019s the UK, Australia, South Africa or Russia. So what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve put the China team obviously in direct contact with those businesses and I know that a number of those ideas are currently being contested in China as we speak. So it\u2019s been more that I\u2019ve seen some really powerful ideas outside of China that I think have relevance in China and then I\u2019d really ask the China team to concept test those and if necessary we\u2019ll make changes to the calendar in the back half of the year.", "David Palmer", "Thank you.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks David. Jona, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Joseph Buckley", "Thank you. A couple of questions on China as well. Do you think that the slower than expected sales trend, do you still relate it to the Shanghai Husi Incident or you think its related to broader things happening in China, whether competitively or just somewhat slower growth.", "Pat Grismer", "Joe, this is Pat. I think it is fair to say that what the brand or the brands are recovering from is the incident from last year, because that\u2019s what had the dramatic impact to sales starting in the middle of last year and we are continuing to recover from that.", "I think it\u2019s also fair to say as we have said on previous calls and at our investor conference that the environment in China has changed in terms of becoming more competitive and so consumers do have more choice. That has raised the bar on us to innovate more than we have in the past, to keep pace with changing Chinese consumer and to continue to move even more aggressively on things like digital. So I think it is fait to say that the environment has changed, but that we are changing in response to that.", "Greg Creed", "And just if I can build on that Joe, we have markets that are much more competitive than China that we compete in and we compete very successfully and so again we can use YUM! now to share where we\u2019ve been very successful, in markets that have even probably two or three time the amount of competition. We can bring that knowhow to bear, to help the China team as they obviously move to more rapidly improve this out performance.", "Joseph Buckley", "Do you have a sense of what the Chinese restaurant market as a whole is doing? Has that slowed significantly also?", "Greg Creed", "I don\u2019t. I mean that\u2019s \u2013 no I don\u2019t have\u2026", "Pat Grismer", "No, I mean I think that generally the economy is growing at a slower pace. So it\u2019s fair to say that and that that is putting pressure on retail generally. I think we also need to bear in mind that with GDP growing this year at around 7%, it remains the fastest growing large economy in the world.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Joe. Next question please Jona.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner", "Thanks very much. My question is I think I\u2019m just a little confused on why there is kind of a tone change in the way you\u2019re talking about how sales are tracking versus your expectations. Just because your gains for the second quarter was for a sequential improvement, you did that. We haven\u2019t even started lapping the July 20 fall off in the business yet. That comes in a week. Is there\u2019s something that\u2019s happened say in June since the quarter end that\u2019s causing the tone change or were you expectations for the quarter just a significant sequential improvement relative to what occurred.", "Pat Grismer", "Brian, this is Pat. Nothing specific that has changed to drive that. Just as we step back and we look at the performance in the first half of the year, it\u2019s fair to say that same store sales while recovering, haven\u2019t been recovering at the pace that we had originally anticipated. Thankfully we are seeing that offset through improved productivity in the stores and those margin gains are therefore muting the profit impact of this lower than expected sales recovery.", "But make no mistake, the sales recovery is happening, not only based on what we see in terms of same store sales and the fact that in the second quarter we lapped a harder comp, so we got sequential improvement on top of lapping a harder comp. But also based on what we see in our key consumer metrics, which as Greg mentioned are a leading indicator of where sales will go. But we felt that it was important to acknowledge that sales are progressing at a slower than expected pace and that is factored into our full year EPS guidance of at least 10%.", "Greg Creed", "But I think I want to make sure everyone understands, we still expect a very strong second half and that we will deliver at least 10% for the full year.", "Brian Bittner", "And you also mentioned \u2013 am I still here with you guys?", "Steve Schmitt", "Yes, go ahead Brian.", "Brian Bittner", "You also mentioned that same store sales in China could be low singles for the year, which would still imply double digit comps in the second half. Is the confidence behind that just the way the core trends accelerated from the first and second quarter, like on a two and three year basis, because that\u2019s what ultimately gives you the most confidence in double digit one year comps in the second half.", "Pat Grismer", "Well, you\u2019re right that we do expect the very strong same store sales growth in the second half, particularly as we lapped last year\u2019s OSI incident and there are multiple indicators that substantiate this view; one year, two year, three year, four year comps for KFC. We look at absolute transaction volumes on a de-seasonalized basis, we look at key consumer metrics, which again are all moving in the right direction. So all of that together giving us confidence that we\u2019ll get the second half bounce back necessary to achieve the profit growth objectives in China, which underpin at least 10% EPS growth for the year.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Brian. Jana, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is opened.", "Jason West", "Yes, thanks guys. I\u2019m not sure how much you\u2019re willing to talk about the other structural ideas, but the idea of recapitalizing the balance sheet has come up, particularly given the substantial franchise assets you guys have and I\u2019m just wondering, if you could give your updated thoughts on that particular as you move towards sort of a 95% franchise mix outside of China. Does that start to change your thinking around the capital structure and then also looking at what\u2019s happening across some of your franchise peers? Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Jason, this is Pat. No change to our policy, which is to optimize our capital structure based on what we believe is in the best interest of shareholders, which is to maintain that low investment grade credit rating and so our policy hasn\u2019t changed and no specific guidance as to what that capital structure might look like when we complete the three year refranchising program we announced in December.", "Jason West", "Okay, but even as a more franchise business you would still like to keep that in investment grade.", "Pat Grismer", "Well, we look at our capital structure from an enterprise perspective. We don\u2019t segment our balance sheet according to one part of the business versus another. So we have to bear in mind that in our China business we have a substantial equity presence with all of the operating leases, which function as virtual debt if you will, which plays into how we optimize our overall capital structure for our shareholders.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Jason. Jana, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Karen Short", "Hi, just a couple of questions on Pizza Hut. So I guess you\u2019ve taken some aggressive stances with your value positioning more recently, but I guess it doesn\u2019t seem to be resonating with the customer or maybe asked another way, do you think it\u2019s a value issue, a trial issue, a frequency issue or anything else, because obviously your peers are generally doing extremely well.", "Greg Creed", "Yes, Karen, thank you for asking a non-China question. In all seriousness, if our peers actually are performing, I think there is no one silver bullet to this solution. You saw us in the quarter playing at more stronger value which actually over the quarter did show improvement across the quarter\u2019s performance and I expect that to continue going into the second half of the year. But this is a sort of total relook, which is we have to have assets to be upgraded. We have to have the compelling value, we have to have compelling innovations, we have to deliver superior experience. We have to improve our e-commerce digital experience. So there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s got to get done.", "I\u2019m very confident in the team that\u2019s in place to make that happen. We\u2019ve got some new people onto the team in Pizza Hut, so we\u2019ve invested in areas like digital, marketing, food innovation, e-commerce. As we said on the call, we\u2019re actually getting into big data analytics and we\u2019re really starting to see some early signs of \u2013 I think that will help us position the brand better and actually really understand where the business has gone to.", "So it\u2019s holistic, we\u2019re on it, we\u2019ve brought people into it. I\u2019m very comfortable and happy with the leadership that we\u2019ve got in place to deliver on it. We\u2019re not happy with the progress, but we are making progress and I think you\u2019ll see us continuing to make more progress as the year unfolds.", "Karen Short", "Great. Thanks.", "Greg Creed", "Thanks Karen.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Karen. Next question Jana please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Great, thank you very much. Just unfortunately I wanted to get back on China for a second. Two things; one just on the comp. I\u2019m wondering as you looked at it perhaps slightly below expectation, whether you see it, maybe this performance by market or day card or weekend, weekday, I\u2019m just wondering as you slice that down 10%, which we can\u2019t do, is there any particular area of concern.", "Another question was just broadly on the positioning of the brand. I think most recently it kind of was focused a little bit more premium with motions and what not. I\u2019m just wondering whether the recent challenge is digital once again, maybe broaden that out, focus a little on value to retain that lower income consumer. Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Hi Jeffery, this is Pat. I\u2019ll respond to your first question and Greg will answer the second. First, with respect to what we\u2019re seeing in the comps and whether when you look at various lengths of segmenting that we\u2019re seeing material differences, the only thing I would highlight is that we are seeing stronger performance in our Tier I cities at both brands. It seems that the Tier I consumers are less phased by the supplier publicity this time around and I would say that that\u2019s especially encouraging, because that\u2019s where we have a higher concentration of stores and also face the strongest competition. So I think that\u2019s further evidence of our brands ongoing recovery and resilience.", "There are some regional economies that are more dependent on industrial production and they are feeling more pressure from slower economic growth and we are seeing the effects of that in weaker sales performance in those regions, particularly in some lower tier cities and in response to that KFCs recently launched regional promotions with 10 RMB Burger to help stimulate traffic. That\u2019s the only thing that really bears mentioning in terms of any variations in comps across the entire market.", "Greg Creed", "So just to talk about the positioning, I think yes, we probably have to find a better balance between innovation and value. Again, if I go back to the KFC markets that are really outperforming, whether it\u2019s Russia, Australia, South Africa or the UK, what you will see in those markets is we have great entry price points, we have great value for money, we have really chicken focused innovation and we are really doing disruptive things in the markets place. So, I think that \u2013 and then we have, I guess it also goes without saying we have great leaders running those business as well.", "So I think that we are going to have to find more balance, but I am very confident that we can find that balance and I am very confident that we have got the ideas and resources around YUM! in order to accomplish that.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Jeff. Next question please Jana.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Senatore", "Thank you. I have two follow-up questions. One is about Pizza Hut and one is, not to belabor the point, also about China. So on Pizza Hut, could you just talk about the developed markets outside the U.S. and in particular diagnose maybe are the issues the same out there, is it stepped up competition, digital value marketing. Just so I kind of understand, because it feels like broadly the brand sort of stepped back a little back in the last couple of quarters.", "And then the follow-up on China is really one about timing. And I guess you laid out sort of $600 million in EBITDA which is a big number, but its less impressive as it takes 5 years to materialize and so do you have internally a sense of at what point you decide, okay this business may not go back to peak volumes and likewise, how long do you decide when you are looking at strategic alternatives, how long do you give yourselves to make decisions. So I\u2019m just trying to frame timing from both fundamental and strategic standpoints.", "Greg Creed", "Let me answer the first part of the question. I think with our Pizza business, strong U.S. \u2013 I\u2019ll say strong global business, there is no doubt about that. So having said that, I think that outside the United States our assets are in much better shape than they are in the United States, but I do think in terms of things like value, e-commerce and digital we need to accelerate our progress in those areas. So I think our assets are in great shape, I think our food quality is in great shape. I think the food innovation is in great shape, but there is no doubt that I think value, as well as the whole customer experience and e-commence are areas that we need to make sure we remain competitive and as leaders in those places.", "Pat Grismer", "And Sara, this is Pat. I\u2019ll respond to your second quarter as to the timing around recovering the $600 million in EBITDA. We\u2019ve never been specific as to a timeframe for that. What I want to let you know however is that we are absolutely confident that the business will return to those 2012 peak average unit volumes and we are absolutely confident based on the progress the team has made to improve unit level economics that as the sales recover there will be significant profit flow through on the sales.", "As to the timing of that, it\u2019s tough to call and I\u2019m not going to make a prediction based on that, nor am I going to talk about how that may play into the timing of any structural moves. Because our top priority regardless of what we do structurally is to bring that business back in terms of sales and profits and so that\u2019s why the focus is as Greg mentioned earlier, on more disruptive innovation, continued strong value offers, all the things that we need to do to make our brand positions even stronger and in an environment that has over time become more competitive.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks. Jana next question please.", "Operator", "The next question is Keith Siegner with UBS. Your line is open.", "Keith Siegner", "So Pat, I\u2019m going to apologize, but I\u2019m going to follow-up a little bit on that. Look, margins in China have come in much better than you expected. You reiterated 20%, with the confidence in the 20% long term. We talk about this $600 million and that\u2019s not sure in this timing, but look when that timing would happen. But let me ask you in a different way; given the success and the productivity, initiatives and what you\u2019ve achieved on the margins, it would seem to me that you should be able to recover the 20% long before you recovery the PKUVs. Is there any reason why that wouldn\u2019t be the case.", "Pat Grismer", "No, I think that\u2019s a fair statement, because the underlying economics have gotten stronger. So as the sales come back, the flow-through will be at a much higher rate.", "Keith Siegner", "That\u2019s it from me thanks.", "Steve Schmitt ", "Thanks Keith. Next question please, Jana.", "Operator", "Yes, Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Karen Holthouse", "Hi, I\u2019m actually going to not ask a question about a China, but instead look at the Taco Bell business in the U.S., where your tier trends continue to accelerate. Just thinking through the moving pieces of that, could you help us understand how much of that might be coming from \u2013 you still continue growth in the breakfast day part versus value versus any other specific products innovation.", "Greg Creed", "I think the good news is the Taco Bell performance in the U.S. is holistic, which is it has great entry price point value. They\u2019ve had growth in breakfast from 6% to 7% mix, which I think takes it to like $90,000 and the West Cost the mix is now over 10%.", "The innovation that was run in the quarter was compelling, disruptive and the assets are in great shape, the customer experience is improving. It\u2019s holistic, its all of the things and at the same time obviously they are starting to experiment with things like delivery and on the cutting edge of that, the mobile app. I think everywhere you turn, this brand is so relevant to its target audience and I think so clearly positioned with products that are driven out of real consumer insights. I think that\u2019s why they\u2019ve had a great first half and that\u2019s why we remain confident about how they are a great second in obviously 2016 and beyond.", "Karen Holthouse", "Great. Thank you.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thank you, Karen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles", "Thanks. Two questions from me. First, if the key to the China term will be innovation and breakfast only represents 7% of sales, it seems to be performing well already. Why not double down efforts on lunch and dinner in the back half of the year and continue innovating on these day parts to turn China faster?", "Greg Creed", "I think my answer would be having done this myself when I was running Taco Bell. You got to balance this out, which is you've got all these day parts that we are going to try and get growth from. And what we have seen in the past, even if we sort of over invest in certain areas, it\u2019s better to have a balance spend behind breakfast, lunch and dinner and then even if you\u2019ve got enough money, you know the day parts like late night and snaking, right. So I think that this is \u2013 we\u2019ve got great product, we are putting the right amount of resource behind it. We got the current promotion on the wing bucket which is off to a nice start and I think this balanced investment behind all the day parts is the right way for us to invest in the business.", "Pat Grismer", "Andrew, this is Pat, I would just build on Greg\u2019s comments by highlighting the important role that coffee will play in building multiple day parts. So while it\u2019s an important part of our breakfast day part, it also contributes to afternoon tea time and it contributes to late night and we are very excited with the results we are seeing from coffee and how its lifted sales as the 2,000 units that have already gotten the coffee, the premium coffee program that we will expanding that to more units by the end of year.", "Andrew Charles", "Got you. So far this year there has been a seasonally high amount of KFC China store closures. Are these stores \u2013 how would you categorize them? Are they primarily located in Tier 1, Tier 2. I mean, what\u2019s driving the decision to close these stores rather than refranchise them?", "Pat Grismer", "Well, this is Pat, Andrew. We make those closure decisions one unit at a time. It\u2019s not always a function of underperformance. There may be forced closures due to \u2013 we come upon the end of a lease and were unable to renew on favorable terms. So there could be a variety of things driving that, but we don\u2019t expect a substantial increase in KFC closures for the full year versus last year, and in fact we expect total closures to be slightly down versus last year, because last year\u2019s number was propped by substantial consolidation of the Little Sheep estate.", "Greg Creed", "Thanks Andrew.", "Steve Schmitt", "Next question please Jana.", "Operator", "Jeff Farmer has your next question with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff Farmer", "Thank you and sorry Greg to keep hitting you in on China. But the last time KFC China saw a rapid same store sales recovery. Concept has a sizable mix in menu pricing tailwind where it looks like mix alone represented more than half of that 21% same store sales growth. The concept is still in the second quarter \u201914.", "So with that, how should we be thinking about the role mix and menu pricing are expected to play in the China same store sales recovery in the coming quarters. And to that point, have you already begun to see the return of the higher average family visits that were a big benefit a year ago in the recovery process.", "Pat Grismer", "Jeff, this is Pat and I\u2019ll respond to your question and Greg may add some things. But from the same recovery standpoint, our focus is primarily on traffic, its rebuilding traffic. From a pricing perspective our policy is unchanged, which is that we generally look to pricing to work with productivity to offset inflation. We are very conscious of the important role that value plays in building traffic over time. So we wouldn\u2019t expect mix to be an outsized contributor to sales growth going forward. The emphasis will be more on traffic driven through a combination of value and innovation.", "Greg Creed", "I would just echo that, which is this is going to be a balance of disruptive innovation and value and I think the combination of those is exactly what we need to focus on.", "Jeff Farmer", "Just a quick follow-up, where does pricing stand right now, menu pricing, actually heading into the back half of \u201915.", "Steve Schmitt", "Jeff, this is Steve. Pricing is about 3% and that should be pretty consistent through the year and just another data point on your question. The quarter check was relatively flat. It was up about 2%, but it is primarily driven by transactions.", "Jeff Farmer", "All right, thank you.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Jeff, Jana, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy", "Thanks. I actually had a question on India. Obviously, it's a small part of the business today, but one that you've spoken about in the past having a great long-term potential. You've now had three quarters of double-digit comp declines in the region. Just curious what's driving that, and if that's changing some of your thinking about long-term unit potential in the region. Thanks.", "Greg Creed", "I think we remain very bullish on India. In the long term there is no reason not to \u2013 there is massive population and urbanization of that population and there is obviously underlying economic growth.", "I think that we did expect \u2013 I think with the Modi government change that there might be a sort of perceptible change in consumer perception and I guess that probably hasn\u2019t had, we haven\u2019t seen that. What I like is that, we have an incredibility strong team in India and I have to say they are probably the best team we have at building knowhow. The Indian team do not suffer from not invented here and they are really aggressively learning what we got and what is working as I said in countries like Australia, South Africa, the UK and Russia. And they are already concept testing and they recognize that value remains an issue; entry price point value remains an issue and obviously innovation, so the same things we keep talking about.", "But what I want to give them credit for is really reaching out to the rest of YUM!, building knowhow, taking the advise back into India and with a real sense of urgency, actually putting them into the market place. So I\u2019m long term bullish. I love the team and I think they are doing all the right things in order to accelerate the sort of improved momentum in same store sales.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Jana, I think we have one more question.", "Operator", "Yes, your final question is Paul Westra with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Paul Westra", "Great. Thank you very much. Just for some clarity on China, maybe help here with the last question. When you say that the comp performance is a little bit below expectations, you mean below your original positive 3% to 7%, so your comments today saying comps could be in the low single digit positives. Second-half comps are still looking to be more positive than the first half that was negative. I just wanted to make sure that's clear.", "Pat Grismer", "That is correct.", "Greg Creed", "Absolutely correct, Paul.", "Paul Westra", "Great. And then when you mentioned your transaction trends on a DC line basis continue to sequentially improve, you are seeing sequential, again month-to-month traffic recovery versus\u2026", "Pat Grismer", "Paul I wouldn\u2019t say month-to-month, certainly quarter-to-quarter. We never said that the recovery was going to be linier and so there is natural choppiness from month-to-month, but as we step back and look at how traffic has rebuilt since the incident last summer, we are seeing a nice steady improvement in that curve.", "Paul Westra", "Okay. I guess then my last sort of new real question, I guess go back to the color on your China average check strategy, I guess maybe before the dual crises. My understanding and I know part of the renovation program was if anything designed to enhance KFC's sort of premium brand positioning maybe moved the check up of all things being equal, move people up the menu, we certainly can understand the focus on traffic here. Is that still a sort of latent opportunity intermediate-term or how does that play in I guess the new menu here?", "Greg Creed", "Paul, I think there\u2019s a couple of things; one, the amount of remodeling going on in China is accelerating. I enjoy what\u2019s coming and I think they are on the way for us to be much more focused on our remodeling of the assets. So the good news is we are sort of doubling the number of assets we are getting remodeled. So that is a great way of keeping our assets relative and then I think it\u2019s just back to the point we\u2019ve been making along, which is about balance. We actually have to balance the pay menu with what I call disruptive innovation and wow value and I think our ability to do that, as well as it will improve the assets and obviously deliver a superior customer experience. All of those combined will be what sort of makes us long term successful and as we keep saying yes, we will have a strong second half, we will go positive. We remain very confident in the long term of China.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today and this concludes our call.

Hottovy - Morningstar", "Operator", "Good morning. My name is Suzanne and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call.", "All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Mr. Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks Suzanne. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; and Pat Grismer, our CFO. Following remarks from Greg and Pat, we\u2019ll take your questions.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.", "All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to the Investors section of the Yum! Brands website at yum.com to find disclosures and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures that may be used on today\u2019s call.", "We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in future use of the recording.", "Finally, we would like to make you aware of the following upcoming Yum! Investor Events, our 2015 Investor and Analyst conference would be on December 10th in Dallas, Texas and our fourth quarter earnings release would be on Wednesday February 3rd.", "And with that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Delivering 14% EPS growth in today\u2019s environment would normally be considered a very good result. But these are not normal times and our performance is anything but satisfactory.", "I know that you all want to hear about China today and have many questions that we are going to answer for you. But before I spend most of my time today on China, I do want to talk about the performance of our three global brands.", "Taco Bell, as you have rightfully come to expect, had another great quarter. Same store sales growth of 4% rolled over plus 3% from a year ago and with another 3% sales growth from new units. Year-to-date, this has doubled the number of new units from last year and margins are now over 21%. This brand is doing all the right things in all the right places.", "KFC had another solid quarter. Same store sales growth of plus 3% with another 3% from new units. We saw notable standout performance in Australia, Russia and Japan and some underperformance versus trend for South Africa and the UK. While KFC in the U.S. is still a small component of the global brand, it continued a steady progress with transactions plus 4% to the category, as the innovation pipeline is now starting to be a force.", "Pizza Hut was relatively flat, which we could argue was pretty much in line with expectations. But let\u2019s be honest; we\u2019re still significantly lagging the performance of our nearest competitors and we clearly have much urgent work to do for this brand to fulfill its potential, which brings me on to what we all want to talk about which is China.", "Let me start by being really clear. We all and I personally take full accountability for our results in China. And while there is clearly a macro softening going on including headwinds from unexpected foreign exchange pressures and yes, the online ordering aggregators who are delivering for mom and pops are in a death battle for supremacy with heavy discounting and the malls look more like fancy food courts than shopping centers, the simple facts are that the economy there is still growing and there is every reason and no excuses to why we should not perform better. I also want you to know that our new China CEO Micky Pant and his team also get it and as I\u2019ll detail are taking significant measures to get sales, traffic and profits back to historic levels.", "If I step back and look at our own research and independent research, they both show that KFC and Pizza Hut have very strong positions. KFC is the undisputed leader in QSR and Pizza Hut owns western casual dining. And both own the hearts and minds of the Chinese customer. And as I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say again, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anyone.", "So the obvious question is what\u2019s going on; why is this taking way too long to recover and in particular, what happened over the past six to seven weeks, particularly in Pizza Hut casual dining?", "Let me start with KFC, which did see sequential improvement and is on trend to continue that improvement into the fourth quarter and beyond. With Micky Pant now at the helm, we have a fresh set of eyes and we are taking the following immediate actions. First, we are sharpening our brand positioning and we will position and market KFC as the unequivocal Chinese favorite; always original, always Chinese.", "Second, we are rejuvenating the product pipeline and dramatically improving our discipline and effectiveness around products testing. We have also begun to test new simplified menu boards that will speed up the ordering process and importantly return and celebrate our core chicken products.", "Third, we will introduce more disruptive value innovation. We will drive transactions, which we know we can do profitably with box meals and day of the week specials, like we have done in the rest of the world.", "And fourth, we will take our proven pipeline of successful chicken innovation from around the world and adapt it to Chinese taste. Both Micky and are confident that these actions will reinvigorate the KFC brand and help us fully recover and more over time.", "So, this leads me to Pizza Hut casual dining in China. Historically we have delivered amazing growth by revamping 25% of our menu every six months. However, it\u2019s clear to all that recent promotions have not performed at historical levels and let me give you a couple of examples.", "In mid-August, we launched a premium-priced steak product, in hindsight, just as the macro started to weaken. Furthermore in recent weeks, we\u2019ve seen companies cut back on parties, dinners and entertaining. So, while our weekend business is going okay, this has impacted our weekday dinner results significantly. So what we are doing about it? We are adding a weekday value dinner promotion on top of the scheduled menu revamp that starts October 19th.", "And if I look back at our previous success, it\u2019s when we\u2019ve offered five-star service at three-star prices. The calendar this year has had things that are more like six-star products such as fajitas and premium steak at six-star pricing at a time when consumers are seeking value. So, we are going to get back to what made us great five-star pizza, pasta and wings at three-star pricing. ", "I know that we are rightly in show me time versus tell me time. But I\u2019m confident that our current performance is no indication of our future potential and that our best days are still ahead across China, India in the three global brands.", "So, in conclusion for Yum!, this is proving to be a more challenging second half driven by a slower recovery in China and the foreign exchange headwinds. However, we believe in the long-term strength of our company. As further evidence of this, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend last night. This marks the 11th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend at a double-digit rate.", "In summary, we are in a unique position at Yum! with three category leading brands that we will strengthen and grow into three iconic global brands that people trust and champion. We remain focused on the three keys to driving shareholder value: New unit development, same-store sales growth, and generating high returns on invested capital. We believe this combination of efforts will enable us to generate consistent shareholder value in the years ahead.", "Now, before I hand this over to Pat, some of you may want to ask today about our views around corporate structure and whether any of the news we\u2019ve shared with you today has any bearing on how we think about our company. The fact is we have a great collection of businesses and they have produced excellent results over the long-term. As I\u2019ve said before, the Yum! Board of Directors regularly reviews strategic options to optimize long-term shareholder value including those involving our corporate structure. We are not going to comment today on any strategic options with our company. As usual, we will discuss our growth plans for 2016 and long-term strategies at our investor conference in December and I hope we will see you there.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Pat.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Today I\u2019ll discuss our third quarter results and share some details behind our current full year outlook.", "As Greg mentioned, Taco Bell continues to be strong, KFC is solid and Pizza Hut remains in turnaround mode. But the big story is our China Division which is recovering but obviously and disappointingly at a much slower pace than we previously expected. Recent week sales in China have significantly dampened our balance of year outlook, particularly at Pizza Hut Casual Dining. I\u2019ll spend a fair bit of time on China.", "But to quickly recap financial results for the third quarter, earnings per share excluding special items increased 14%, a marked improvement from the 7% EPS decline we delivered in the first half of the year.", "Same-store sales not only turned positive in China but were also positive in all three of our global brand divisions. Worldwide restaurant margins at company owned stores were 18%, an increase of 3 percentage points versus prior year. Foreign currency translation adversely impacted our EPS growth by nearly 6 percentage points in the quarter including an unexpected devaluation of the RMB in mid-August. Here are the highlights of each division\u2019s results and the implications for full year performance.", "China Division operating profit increased by 64% prior to foreign currency translation with restaurant margins approaching 20%, nearly 5 percentage points better than last year. The China team continued to do an excellent job of managing costs and I\u2019m confident that the team\u2019s sustained productivity improvements will yield meaningful profit upside as sales recover over the long term.", "As expected, sales turned significantly positive as we lapped last year\u2019s supplier incident which occurred in late July, specifically in the first seven weeks of the third quarter leading up to the supplier incident lap, same-store sales for the division averaged minus 11% and then for the next four weeks averaged plus 31%, representing a 42-point swing to the positive, giving us optimism that the recovery was underway. For the entire quarter, same-store sales grew 2% for the division including 3% growth at KFC and a 1% decline at Pizza Hut Casual Dining.", "So that\u2019s the past but what about the future, more specifically now that we are in the fifth week of China\u2019s fourth quarter, how are China sales trending and how does that shape our perspective on full year results; and as importantly how could we have missed our previous forecast by so much? I\u2019ll answer both questions.", "Encouragingly, KFC same-store sales in China are continuing to recover as evidenced by our most recent sales results. As a point of reference, KFC China\u2019s same-store sales were plus 9% for the month of September which is the first month in China\u2019s fourth quarter. Based on what we know today, we expect Q4 will be another quarter of sequential improvement for KFC in China. To be clear however, this recovery is occurring at a slower pace than we previously estimated and this is weighing on our prior outlook for fourth quarter results. At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, the situation is much more severe and impactful. In late August and continuing into September, we witnessed a very substantial deceleration in same-store sales versus our forecast. The loss of sales momentum is causing significant deleverage in our Pizza Hut Casual Dining business, which represents about a third of China Division profits.", "Based on our current assessment, we believe the drivers are three-fold: Number one, extraordinary volatility in financial markets, the surprise currency devaluation and overall softer economic conditions are weighing more heavily on the higher ticket casual dining sector in China. Number two; we are experiencing what we believe is a short-term but significant impact of online ordering aggregators entering the casual dining space. And number three and most importantly, our marketing promotions materially underperformed our expectations, as Greg said and we lost significant momentum in the business which we\u2019re now working to recover and believe we can fix.", "We did not foresee this confluence of events and quite frankly we are very surprised by the business trends that began to unfold at the end of August. As another point of reference, Pizza Hut Casual Dining same-store sales were actually down 3% for the month of September, demonstrating a very rapid downturn in the business. This was 25 points below our previous expectations, a major miss and something we didn\u2019t see coming in August.", "Based on current trends now about one-third of the way into China\u2019s fourth quarter, we expect Pizza Hutt Casual Dining sales in China will remain negative through the end of the year possibly into low double digits. On that basis, we now estimate the China Division same-store sales will be mid-single-digit positive for the fourth quarter and low-single-digit negative for the full year. This is obviously a very disappointing result and well below our previous expectations even as the China team is working with urgency to improve sales momentum at both KFC and Pizza Hut.", "So what\u2019s our current outlook -- so that\u2019s our current outlook but why didn\u2019t we forecast this. As I mentioned earlier, the deceleration in China sales was led by Pizza Hut and the drivers behind that decline emerged very rapidly and without much warning. In today\u2019s volatile environment with the recent macro and competitive pressures we mentioned, it continues to be difficult to forecast sales in China for both brands. We make our best judgment at any point in time based on the information available. We will provide another update on China sales at our investor meeting in December.", "Turning to our KFC Global Division, we saw another quarter of growth in sales, margin and profit prior to foreign currency translation. Sales were particularly strong in Australia, Japan and Russia and we were pleased with same-store sales growth of 2% in the U.S. as it included same-store transaction growth of 3%, demonstrating continued improvement in this business. These results were partially offset by softer sales in South Africa, Thailand and the UK. Despite the benefit of sales leverage, division operating margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to increased advertising expense associated with our U.S. turnaround program which also impacted the division\u2019s profit growth by 2 percentage points in the quarter. Division operating margins were also impacted by 1 percentage point due to strategic investments in G&A and increased pension expense.", "All in, KFC\u2019s operating profit grew 3% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Importantly, KFC new unit development remains strong with 335 new international restaurants opened year to date. And on a net basis, we\u2019ve opened over 40% more new international restaurants in the first three quarters of 2015 versus 2014. This gives us great confidence in the strength of the KFC brand and its growth oriented franchisees.", "At Pizza Hut, same-store sales grew 1% including growth of 4% in emerging markets offset by flat sales in developed markets including the U.S. Total operating profit excluding foreign exchange was unchanged versus last year, despite same-store sales growth and lower cheese prices; this is primarily due to strategic investments in international G&A. As Greg mentioned, we clearly have our work cut out for us to Pizza Hut. However we are taking positive steps and making necessary investments to improve Pizza Hut\u2019s brand position, operations and digital experience. From an international development prospective, we opened 105 new units in the quarter, bringing our year to date number to 206.", "Finally, Taco Bell continued to post excellent results with same-store sales growth of 4%, overlapping 3% growth from last year. A strong combination of value and innovation drove this result. We were also pleased with the performance of our breakfast daypart which contributed 6% sales mix and gives us a great platform from which to grow.", "Restaurant level margins of 22% were 140 basis points better than a year ago helped by a tailwind in commodities as beef and cheese prices had both declined about 13%. From a development perspective, we opened 111 net new restaurants year to date which is nearly double our number at this point last year and demonstrates a compelling economic model and strong franchisee investment in the brand.", "So, how does all of this ladder up to a revised full year outlook? I\u2019ll start by acknowledging that this is well below our previous guidance led by a much lower sales outlook at Pizza Casual Dining in China and exacerbated by incremental foreign exchange pressure. As outlined earlier, we now estimate the China division same-store sales will be low single digit negative for the full year. As a result, we expect China Division\u2019s full year profits will grow versus prior year in the mid to high single digits excluding the impact of foreign exchange.", "Collectively, our global brand divisions are largely in line with our previous expectations with better than expected performance at Taco Bell compensating for lower than expected performance at Pizza Hut. And finally, stronger than expected foreign exchange headwinds including the mid-August R&D devaluation are putting an incremental 1 to 2 percentage points of pressure on our EPS growth rate for the year. On a full year basis, we now expect foreign exchange in total to be about 6 percentage points of EPS headwind, significantly more than what we expected as we entered the year and the most pressure that we\u2019ve ever experienced in the history of our company.", "With all of this in mind, we are lowering our guidance for 2015 and now expect EPS growth to be low single digit positive. To be clear, the key drivers are a significant reduction in China sales and a meaningful increase in foreign exchange headwinds, neither of which we saw coming at the time of our last forecast update.", "In terms of new unit development, we expect to open about 2,000 units outside the U.S. this year. Now, I know many of you are wondering why we are continuing to open new restaurants in China at a fairly rapid pace and I\u2019ll share a point of view on that because we continue to expect about 700 new unit openings in China this year. First of all, cash paybacks in our current new units across both KFC and Pizza Hut continue to be in the range of 3 to 4 years which we believe provides an attractive return on invested capital. Obviously this assumes that current conditions are temporary which is what we strongly believe and are continuing to monitor.", "Now when it comes to development, we take a long-term view of the growth opportunity in China which despite recent volatility, continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world with strong long-term tailwinds for the restaurant industry including a doubling of the consuming class.", "When you step back and look at what the industry will be 10 to 20 years from now, we believe we are still in the early innings. We have leading brands with strong competitive positions and unmatched development capability in this market. Remember, new unit development has been a number one driver of China Division profit growth over the years and we expect this to be the case in the future. And one thing we know about development is that once you lose momentum in terms of indentifying and securing retail sites it\u2019s tough to regain it.", "Now, don\u2019t think we have our head in the sand regarding recent results in their implications for development. We absolutely take account of these results and evaluate each new unit development opportunity in a very disciplined fashion. And we are certainly taking a very close look at the situation that is unfolded at Pizza Casual Dining and determining how that may impact near term development plans, similar to how we scale back on KFC development in recent years. At the same time, we are just getting started with Pizza Hut home service and continue to be confident that Chinese consumer demand for delivered meals will rise rapidly.", "We are still in the process of shaping our plans for 2016, so it\u2019s premature to give guidance for next year\u2019s development in China. However it\u2019s quite possible that we will temper the pace of Pizza Casual Dining development until we are absolutely sure that we have a solid understanding of what\u2019s happening with the brand and how that may impact our investment returns for the long run. We will provide an update on this at our December investor conference.", "Outside of China and India, nearly 90% of our new units this year will be opened by our franchise partners. And we are building momentum around the world to evolve to the more franchise owned model we talked about at last year\u2019s investor conference. This refranchising activity will gain momentum over the next couple of years and will vary by brand but in the aggregate we still expect to achieve a mid-90s franchise ownership percentage by the end of 2017 excluding China and India.", "Before I conclude, I\u2019d like to point out that our business continues to generate a significant amount of cash. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated EBITDA of almost $2 billion and importantly, we remain disciplined in how we use this cash and have a good track record of returning all available cash to our shareholders. As evidence of this, we announced the 12% increase in our quarterly dividend last night. As Greg mentioned, this marks the 11th consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our dividend at a double-digit rate. With this latest increase, we also raised our long-term dividend payout target to 45% to 50% of annual net income before special items.", "You might have also read about some good news we received from Moody\u2019s recently. With the change in their rating methodology whereby they\u2019ve reduced imputed debt from eight times annual rent expense to six times annual rent expense, we\u2019ve gained nearly $2 billion of additional debt capacity while maintaining our investment grade credit rating with Moody\u2019s. We\u2019re pleased with this decision and our evaluating its implications for our capital structure holistically. We\u2019ve consistently been very disciplined about optimizing our capital structure for our shareholders and as usual, we\u2019ll talk about our capital structure and any potential changes at our investor conference in December.", "So in conclusion, 2015 is now on a very different trajectory than we have previously expected, largely due to slower than expected sales in China, particularly at Pizza Casual Dining and higher than expected pressure from foreign exchange. However, we remain confident in the long-term health of our business, we have a past double-digit EPS growth and we look forward to sharing our plans to get our whole business back on track in 2016 at our December investor meeting.", "And with that, I\u2019ll open up the line to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC. Your line is open.", "David Palmer", "Thanks, good morning. I realized you\u2019re going to be reticent to talk about structure changes with the business but I mean one fundamental observation about Yum! today is that the last three years have been one where the company is no longer hitting the 10% plus EPS growth, the combination of growth rate and consistency is broken down. Thinking about Yum! going forward, obviously structure change could be part of the solution there but if the company doesn\u2019t make a structure change as you\u2019re observing the business today, what can you do to restore the consistency in growth?", "Greg Creed", "So David, let me just start, I think as you know, over the last three years particularly in China, we had two food safety incidents and obviously we\u2019ve had marketing missteps. So clearly, what we got to do is primarily turn around China. I think where we do perform well, we\u2019ve got the following in place, we\u2019ve got very clear brand positioning, we have insight driven product innovation, we have disruptive value, we have upgraded assets, we have social, mobile and digital at the cutting edge and we deliver the customer a superior experience. So we know those are the things that when we deliver, we deliver outstanding results. So, I think the thing we have to do in all the divisions is to get back and execute against those basics. So that\u2019s what I got the organization absolutely focused on. So my number one priority is to turn around China using all of those I guess tools or directions that I\u2019ve just articulated.", "David Palmer", "And just a follow-up on the China business that low double-digit decline for Pizza Hut, if that\u2019s in the low 20s percent of that China business, that low double-digit decline would imply the mid-single-digit system same-store sales something like mid teens comp for the KFC brand. Is that math about right and how do you feel about the two-year trend and the momentum on the KFC China side?", "Pat Grismer", "David that math actually isn\u2019t right. We\u2019re expecting mid-single-digit same-store sales positive for KFC -- for the division, excuse me, in the fourth quarter. So with negative same-store sales for Pizza Hut, they could be in the low double-digits. The KFC number could be in the range of high single-digits to low double-digits.", "David Palmer", "Okay, thank you. And how do you feel about that momentum on a two-year basis or just -- versus your plan before is KFC part of this guide down at all?", "Pat Grismer", "Well obviously, it\u2019s well below our previous outlook. There is no question whether you look at a one-year or two-year or three-year relative to where we were as of our Q2 earnings call, there has been a substantial reduction in overall momentum. The important thing is that the recovery is continuing with KFC, albeit at a slower than expected pace and we have evidence of that. The real issue we have is with Pizza Hut Casual Dining where we saw a very sudden and sharp deceleration take shape at the end of August and persist now into the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse", "Looking at the unit growth in China instead of the comp growth, we\u2019ve seen another tick up in unit closures at KFC. Can we just get a little bit more color on where those are coming from? Is it more, higher tier cities or you might be coming up against lease renewals, lower tier cities that might have some more macro issues? The rates doubled sort of since last quarter and more than doubled year-over-year. So what\u2019s driving that step function?", "Pat Grismer", "Definitely there has been an uptick in China unit closures relative to our original expectations. Part of that is Little Sheep; there continue to be closures in Little Sheep and that is placing a drag on net unit growth; we do expect about 60 closures there this year. But every year we have a base of store closures including forced closures, relocation opportunities and lease expirations.", "So even if we had no underperforming stores, we would go for closure. But at KFC, it is true that performance driven closures have been higher than we anticipated coming into the year and that\u2019s really the cumulative effect of three years of softer than expected sales. We do look at these on an individual basis and there are unique circumstance supporting each one of those decisions.", "As to how the mix may have shifted to where the closures are coming from, for KFC about 70% have been in the higher tier cities and we are seeing a higher mix in the lower tier cities but that only involves a handful of stores. From a trade zone perspective, we\u2019re not seeing material shifts between commercial, residential and retail although within retail we are seeing a higher proportion of closures at hypermarkets and malls as opposed to department stores. And then I guess the last thing I would point out is that in terms of the mix of closures based on the year that the stores were opened, we are seeing a slight uptick in the percentage of stores that are being closed that relate to the ramp up in our development in 2011 and 2012 and we think that that may continue.", "But I just want to reinforce that with what we see by way of new unit returns and the confidence that provides us around development and how that creates value for shareholders, we continue to expect to open about 700 units this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler of CLSA. Your line is open.", "Diane Geissler", "Another question on China; I wanted to talk about the online delivery which seems to have been sort of a cutthroat this year and probably the source of the biggest surprise, maybe in disruption. I know there are some rumors in the media about one of the big O2O and restaurant review apps merging, which maybe reduces the number of players but how can investors have confidence that the situation will improve in 2016? Because it just seems so competitive and I guess, as you look at your Pizza Hut business in China, what are you doing specifically to get yourself where you need to be to either -- to be more active in delivery or have a bigger slice of that? Because it just seems like the O2O players are pushing the mom and pop restaurants and that\u2019s obviously to your competitive disadvantage. Can you talk a little bit about what you plan to do specifically to address the competitive pressures in the delivery business?", "Greg Creed", "Let me answer that holistically. First of all, delivery is -- we have about 300 delivery units which is a small part of our overall business compared to Pizza Hut in China. But as you said, there is definitely what we call a savage battle for supremacy going on about -- around the aggregators who are obviously heavily discounting. We are actually putting our foot in the water and playing with them but it\u2019s a very small part of our business. So, I think the answer is that we don\u2019t believe that the economics will sustain all the people that are currently in the market playing at these discounted prices.", "And I think as we\u2019ve seen these aggregators in other parts of the world because China is not the only place where this is occurring, what tends to happen is they are all fighting for market share dropping the prices but then eventually the prices have to go up. And secondly the actually delivery experience from these aggregators we would argue is not as good as delivery experience that we deliver from Pizza Hut.", "So, I think the answer is there is a lot of savage market share fights going on. We don\u2019t believe in the long term that they can sustain these discounts. We know in the rest of the world prices go up; we know that their performance -- their delivery performance is not as good as ours but that does not mean that we haven\u2019t -- we are not dabbling in this area, obviously testing as part of the Pizza Hut strategy.", "Diane Geissler", "If you look at experience sort of outside of china when this has occurred before, what has been the average length of time that it\u2019s taken for the industry to sort of shake itself out?", "Greg Creed", "Well, I think that it\u2019s very early as this is occurring -- it\u2019s very early days for this whole aggregator business but I can assure you that we are monitoring it on a global basis whether it is Europe, Asia, North America, Australia wherever it is going on. It\u2019s way too early to call how long that\u2019s going to take but it is very clear that -- while I guess it\u2019s a little more mature we\u2019ve seen these businesses move from burning a lot of cash or heavy discounting into taking price increases and obviously that\u2019s going to stunt consumer demand.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore of Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Senatore", "I have two questions, one -- both follow-ups on China. One is really a communication question. Back in late August when you were about 10 days before the end of the quarter in China, you put out a filing that remarked on the significant recovery. I guess a lot of us are really surprised that the 3Q number came in so much below our own expectations, given that the language or what would seem to be the message is that things are on track. So, did we misinterpret the filing; did something happen in the last week and a half? I guess I\u2019m just trying to reconcile what seems to have been positive commentary fairly late in the quarter with the 3Q results and setting aside maybe what may have happened in September and subsequently in 4Q. And then, I\u2019ll have another question.", "Greg Creed", "Well, I can\u2019t speak to how you or others interpreted what we said. But as I said in my remarks earlier, the facts are that in the seven weeks leading up to the lap, the average same-store sales for the division were minus 11 and then for the next four weeks swung 42 points to the positive to plus 31. So in fact, same-store sales had turned significantly as we lapped last year\u2019s supplier incident.", "Sara Senatore", "But were you then expecting low-single digit comps for the third quarter because the second half guidance implied low-double digits for the both halves? So, I guess I\u2019m just trying to figure out, to your point maybe it was our interpretation but did the third quarter surprise you?", "Greg Creed", "Clearly third quarter results in total were below the expectations we had as of our second quarter earnings release. So, at the time of our second quarter earnings release based on results we saw at the time, we expected as we mentioned that the recovery would continue across the second half of the year. And I believe on the call we effectively affirmed for the second half double-digit positive same-store sales growth and that was our strong belief at the time based on what we were reading in the business. As of the date of this announcement that you mentioned, we referenced that sales turned significantly positive as we lapped the supplier incident from last year which was the fact supported by the numbers that I shared with you.", "Sara Senatore", "And then my other question, this goes back to again -- I know you are not going to discuss strategic actions but I think pretty much every quarter, we\u2019ve been disappointed by top line versus expectations at an increasingly wide gap. So, there is some question about the strategy and you\u2019ve talked about that. Clearly the stock market is saying that Yum! is not creating a lot of value right now. At what point do you decide if it\u2019s not three years of flat earnings, at what point is it time to reconsider the view that you are absolutely the right people to run the day-to-day operations of Yum! China, or to have the structure that you have right now?", "Greg Creed", "Well, the key for us is to turn this business around with particular focus on China. I think that anything else is speculation. But I can absolutely assure you that we have three great global brands that we are absolutely focused on doing the things that I talked about earlier brand positioning, product innovation, disruptive value, upgraded assets, social, mobile, digital and in then the superior customer experience. We have to get that in all five divisions. When we get that in all five divisions, then we\u2019ll obviously earn the right to have the share price that we believe this business deserves. So that is my absolute focus. Having said that we are always open to looking at alternatives and I\u2019ve said we are looking at alternative. But right now my absolute focus is on getting these five divisions firing pretty much like I\u2019d like them firing like Taco Bell is firing right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer and Company. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner", "I know I am probably not going to get an answer to this, so maybe it\u2019s just more of a statement than anything. But look I acknowledge that China has fit historically into the long term growth plan and as everyone has been talking about, it has been hurting the model and the valuation of your stock for three years now. But the problem here is the visibility looking forward is no better today than it was last year or the year before. And Greg, you started the call talking about everything but China, because you really wanted to highlight the strength in that business.", "But the way Yum! is structured today, China is all that matters and we all know that. And at some point I wonder when the board and the management team believes that the China turnaround story no longer makes sense to completely dominate the investment conversation for Yum! Brands and at some point, when they would believe a separation is a more realistic option I think for the sake of what appears to be an undeniable opportunity for value enhancement, not just in the near-term but the long-term? I mean, you are basically getting no credit for having the China business in your portfolio today. I could argue you are almost getting zero dollars of value for that business. And at some point, a China turnaround may happen and could happen and there could be a plan where investors still participate in that upside but also get the choice to participate in that upside and can invest in the ex China business which is performing beautifully. And I\u2019m just wondering if there is any timeline or more focus in the board room on understanding that and thinking about that?", "Greg Creed", "I think what I can say is we\u2019re always going to believe in China and we\u2019re always going to participate in its growth. Let me be really clear. I think we\u2019ve also got a new leader on the ground in China and with the new leader comes fresh ideas and a fresh perspective. And there is no doubt that he is taking a lot of the ideas that we know have proven and worked around the world and we\u2019re putting those into test aggressively whether it\u2019s KFC or Pizza Hut in China. So that\u2019s what I believe is the best answer which is we continue to believe in China, we all like to participate in China\u2019s growth, we\u2019ve got a new leader, he is bringing massive action to bear, which is great because he ran the Global KFC and Pizza Hut businesses in his prior job. He knows what\u2019s worth; he knows what\u2019s resonating with customers; he knows how to adapt certain taste to local taste. And that guy is doing everything he can do. He is being incredibly well received by the China team. People are saying he is incredibly smart. He is incredibly experienced. He is incredibly humble. He is incredibly collaborative. And he has an action agenda.", "So, as far as I\u2019m concerned, we\u2019ve got a new leader in place who is going to bring all of his ability to bear to turn it around. And as I\u2019ve said we\u2019ll always believe in China and we\u2019ll always going to participate in its growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jason West", "Just I guess going back to the competitive issues, particularly on the order aggregators and I guess if there is anything else that\u2019s really surprised you. But that seems to be one of the bigger surprises that\u2019s emerged more recently. And you talked about the impact on sort of delivery at Pizza Hut but you also mentioned the Pizza Hut Casual Dining was impacted by this. But are you saying that the order aggregator sort of delivery model would impact Pizza Hut Casual Dining specifically or is this also not going to be an issue for KFC, which also offers similar type meal occasions?", "Greg Creed", "No, I think it\u2019s clear that right now with the massive discounting just going on, you can get a meal that you would traditionally go out for, delivered to your house at very low price. But as I said, we know these economics are not sustainable. We know they are burning through all this cash. That\u2019s why on the Pizza Hut delivery side, we are experimenting with it. But I think that we feel and we have seen as we have practiced in other markets around the world, eventually these prices go up; when these prices go up, demand wanes. It\u2019s the fact of life. So, we are", "watching it; we\u2019re monitoring it; we are doing it on a global basis. We have got our toe in the water. And as you also know, we are testing delivery with Taco Bell in the U.S. So, we\u2019re not just limiting our testing to either KFC or Pizza Hut, we\u2019re also adding some testing with Taco Bell.", "Jason West", "So, just one follow-up, going back to the store growth outlook and new store performance, it sounds like store performance is holding up reasonably well in the new stores but you also mentioned some closures in some stores that were open a few years ago. I guess can you talk broadly about the portfolio, particularly at KFC if you have pockets of stores that were maybe were opened in regions that were expected to be economically developing that really haven\u2019t come along yet and there may be pockets of large store closures that could really help alleviate some of the comp pressure or is it really not -- the comps really aren\u2019t broken up in that way?", "Pat Grismer", "There really hasn\u2019t been a significant shift in the mix of closures, as I mentioned earlier in response to Karen\u2019s question whether we are looking at type of trade zone or city tier; I mean there\u2019s some changes around the edges but nothing really meaningfully different. But what is meaningfully different versus prior year is that because of the cumulative effect of three years of underperformance at KFC, we are looking at more closures this year versus last. But the composition is largely in line with what we\u2019ve seen in last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner of UBS. Your line is open.", "Keith Siegner", "My first question is I just want to tease out a little bit more of this macro versus aggregators issue. So, is the aggregator issue prevalent across all tiers? And let\u2019s just talk KFC for example on this too. Is it present across all tiers? And then maybe to add to that, how is the tier performance doing; are you still seeing tier one and tier two do better; is KFC weakness more concentrated in those three through six? How are those two pieces playing out?", "Greg Creed", "I don\u2019t think the aggregator impact in China is having a huge impact on our KFC business. I think what we\u2019ve got to do in our KFC business is introduce what I would say is disruptive value and get our positioning much clearer, go on the offense, talk about all the positives, get back to the core products which every time we go back to the core around the world, we know works. So, I don\u2019t believe that is a huge impact on the KFC business. And then as I said on the Pizza Hut business, obviously the aggregators are more active in the higher tier markets than they are in the smaller tier markets. And again from a Pizza Hut perspective, it\u2019s clearly having some impact on our performance along with the macros. But as I said, I think whether they can sustain this discounting to sustain this performance, I think we all believe is very questionable.", "Pat Grismer", "And Keith, in response to the second part of your question, very similar to last quarter when we look at same-store sales growth across city tiers, the higher-tier cities are performing better. And that\u2019s largely because among the lower-tier cities we have some markets that are very heavily dependent on industry. And industry as you know has been soft in China. And so that\u2019s weighing on consumer confidence and spending in those regions.", "Greg Creed", "So Keith, I guess if you had to sort of prioritize it, I would say first of all marketing missteps; second, the softening Chinese economy; and third, the impact from malls and aggregators. And obviously, we\u2019re going to take massive action to turn around certainly the marketing missteps that we\u2019ve taken.", "Keith Siegner", "And then one quick follow-up, Pat. You mentioned earlier the change in Moody\u2019s analysis of your implied debt in the $2 billion of extra capacity. Is it safe to assume that you leverage this that you tap into that capacity and if not, why not?", "Pat Grismer", "We have not. However, as I mentioned earlier, we look at our capital structure holistically. So, we consider a number of different things before making a decision to take on more debt as an example. Last year, we increased our borrowings through our short-term credit facility. So, we are certainly not averse to doing that. But we look at these things holistically and we\u2019ll provide a further update at our December investor conference in how we are thinking about this.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass", "First, if I could just go back to the KFC and draw the dotted line in sales between the 31% increase you experienced, let\u2019s say, ending in mid-August, and the 9% in September, was that a linear deceleration; did it happen all at once to around for example, I think the devaluation happened around then? And are you -- how did September trend; where are we in that continuum now just to get the expectations right for the fourth quarter?", "Pat Grismer", "John, first of all, the 31% was a division number. So, that was not a KFC number. And I\u2019m not going to give brand-specific numbers around those data points. But you\u2019ll have to bear in mind what we were lapping from last year and the overall shape of that as is the case any time we experience some event, which is the impact is sharpest at the beginning and then it begins to diminish over time. And so the reverse applies to when you are lapping that. So, you have the easier compares in the early weeks following the event. And then those compares become tougher. And I would say that generally follows the shape of our expectations into the fourth quarter.", "John Glass", "So when you -- so just to be very clear, when there was an event like the devaluation that did not abruptly slow sales, it wasn\u2019t a specific macro event you saw that bent that curve for example?", "Pat Grismer", "Well, what we did see was in the last one to two weeks of August in China, I think we\u2019ve all read about what were very significant events. Remember it was in mid-August that the currency was devalued quite significantly and a surprise to everybody. And it was less than two weeks later that there was a significant change in the stock market which again was unprecedented and caught everybody by surprise. And that does coincide with when we saw a material change in the shape of Pizza Hut Casual Dining same-store sales. And just to remind you also, the impact of ForEx, apart from the impact that it had to our business in China, very significant impact to our earnings per share 1 to 2 points in the quarter and full ForEx impact of more than 6 points on the year.", "John Glass", "And then Greg, could I just ask, what is the right timeframe to look at this recovery? You\u2019ve got a new CEO in place. Are we going to hear next quarter that look it\u2019s going to take some time to rebuild the product pipeline and how much of this will be revolved or resolved with pricing? How much of this is maybe resetting pricing or is that not what you are really contemplating as this recovery takes shape?", "Greg Creed", "No John, as I speak to Micky, and I -- as you can probably imagine, I\u2019m speaking to Micky an awful lot. The discussion we\u2019ve had is that there are some clearly proven ideas that we\u2019ve had success around the world, whether it\u2019s box meals for lunch, day of the week specials, product innovation, and he is in the process of putting all of that into test into China as quickly as he can. So I think that in December, what we\u2019ll be able to do is give you an update, a much clearer update of the things that we\u2019ve taken that have been successful around the world that we\u2019ve put into China with a KFC or Pizza Hut. We will hopefully have some preliminary numbers, even if they are just early test market days. And I think we\u2019ll also have the overlap benefit. So, the way I look at it is a lot of proven things about to go into test in China. They include disruptive value so the equivalent of the $5 box meals; the $20 dinner meals, as well as product innovation around core. So, we\u2019re probably going to have more tests going on in the fourth quarter in China than we\u2019ve seen in a long time in China. And I believe that Micky will be able to give us an update, some progress on those tests when he presents at the December conference.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Westra of Stifel. Your line is open.", "Paul Westra", "I know you don\u2019t want to give too much color on the outlook for \u201816, but my question is how lasting should we think about what your implied fourth quarter combined China margins could be? And I guess Pat, your full year China profit growth guidance of high to mid-single-digit implies a fourth quarter profit number that might be slightly above $100 million which represents a 65% drop in profits from your actual third quarter performance that\u2019s about double what it normally is historically. And frankly the cause of that drop is not really coming from the top line miss, because your fourth quarter comp guidance pretty much matches your third quarter comp miss, at least for us on the sell side. So at least on paper, given that math, it seems as though Pizza Hut Casual Dining\u2019s profitability is almost being wiped out here in the fourth quarter. Assuming these numbers are even remotely close, are there massive turnaround investments planned for fourth quarter? And if not, are there contingency plans at least in place, so that this margin degradation doesn\u2019t flow too much into next year?", "Pat Grismer", "You\u2019ve asked two questions, so I\u2019ll respond to them in turn. First with respect to 2016 outlook, it\u2019s premature and we\u2019re not going to give any guidance on 2016, other than as I said in my prepared remarks, our overall goal is to get our whole business back on track, and we\u2019ll provide more specific plans around that and set expectations at our investor conference in December. Specifically with respect to China\u2019s fourth quarter profit outlook, you\u2019ll have to remember that the fourth quarter is one of the lowest seasonal times of the year. So absolute profits historically for China have been very low, whereas -- relatively low, whereas the third quarter is the peak summer season when profits are relatively high. So, it\u2019s not fair to draw those sorts of comparisons between Q3 and Q4 on an absolute basis. But the outlook we\u2019ve given for China Division profit performance for the full year takes full effect of what we\u2019ve guided by way of same-store sales growth for both KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China and the corresponding impacts to their levels of profitability bearing in mind that it\u2019s a low seasonal period for the business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino of Baird. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino", "First, Pat, could you give us some perspective on what KFC was cycling in the month of September, so we have a good understanding of how to frame up the plus 9% comp? And then I have a follow-up.", "Pat Grismer", "We didn\u2019t provide monthly comps last year. And I don\u2019t know that it would be necessarily helpful to do that at this stage.", "David Tarantino", "My real question has to do with the KFC business. And I guess if I look back to the business since the 2012 supplier incident and following this most recent one in 2014, it doesn\u2019t look like the traffic has really rebounded much following either of those incidences. So, I guess the question is, do you think you\u2019re seeing a step change in the transaction counts that just represents a lower base from which you\u2019ll have to grow going forward or do you see something in your consumer metrics that would suggest an outsized recovery or an outsized rebound is really possible at this stage? Because I guess the trend-line would suggest it\u2019s more of the former than the latter. So, I was just curious to hear your thoughts on that.", "Pat Grismer", "David, the one thing we are sure of is that the business is going to fully recover over time. We can\u2019t be precise about the exact timing of that. It is very difficult to call and there\u2019s no denying the fact that the shape of the recovery today is weaker than we had previously expected. But we do have good evidence of the recovery in terms of both absolute transaction counts and how they have improved from last year\u2019s event and consumer -- key consumer metrics or brand perception metrics which have improved versus a year ago. So, we do have different indications that substantiate our view that the recovery is continuing and remain confident in the long-term that we will fully recover those transactions.", "Greg Creed", "I would just add that as I talk to the brands around the world and I look at the businesses around the world where KFC or Pizza Hut or Taco Bell are successful, we\u2019ve got a very good value platform as part of our brand offering. And I think it would be fair to say that we probably should have played and could have played value and I don\u2019t mean at the expense of margin, because we know how to do both. And that\u2019s why, as I said earlier, Micky is taking proven things like the box meals for lunch and the day of the week specials that we\u2019ve run very successfully, particularly in the markets that we continue to do well in, Australia, Japan, South Africa, Russia. So, you will see us play more disruptive value. And you will see us be much clearer around our brand positioning, always original, always Chinese. So, I do believe that those will help our transaction growth, both as we enter the fourth quarter and obviously next year.", "So, let\u2019s be honest. We have an incredibly strong brand. It\u2019s really up to us. We know that this is a retail business and we know how to get consumers to respond. So, we\u2019re going to do all the things that we know we\u2019d do when we do it, they\u2019ll respond and it will work. And as I said, the discussions that I\u2019m having with Micky are all around that fact.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Joseph Buckley", "Based on number of the comments, it sounds like you think your brands in China are lagging the overall industry. Would you comment about that; is that the case; what do you think is going on with the restaurant industry as a whole in China?", "Greg Creed", "Sorry, I missed -- I actually missed -- can you just repeat the question, Joe? Sorry.", "Joseph Buckley", "Sure, I\u2019m sorry. Let me pick up the handset. The comments you\u2019ve made about your brands in China, it sounds like you think you are lagging the overall industry in China. And I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s the case. And what you think is going on with the restaurant industry as a whole in China compared to your sales results? And then I have one more please.", "Greg Creed", "It\u2019s not as easy in China to get an accurate picture of the category or the market like it is in Australia or the U.S. or the UK. So it is difficult to get an absolute number. Look, there is no doubt that we are the number one QSR brand in KFC and the number one casual dining brand in Pizza Hut. And as I said earlier, both our research and independent research suggests that the brands are still in incredibly strong positions. As I said, I do think we can tighten up the positioning; I do think we need more core product innovation; we do need more disruptive value. So, I think all of those things which are things that Micky and I are working on, we need to put in place in order to take advantage of the strong brand positioning that we\u2019ve got.", "Joseph Buckley", "And then I\u2019m going to sneak two into one for this question. Could you share checking traffic metrics for the quarter in China? And then my other question is, as we look at some of the costs in China that are contributing to this great margin performance, the labor costs per store have been down pretty significantly and that\u2019s in nominal terms, probably down even more in real terms, assuming labor costs inflation is still there. Is there -- should we be concerned that the cost management is so tight there that it might be crimping the ability to get sales recovery?", "Pat Grismer", "Joe, we absolutely do not believe that the significant productivity initiatives undertaken by the China team are impacting the customer experience. We have very clear measures that we use to assess how the customer experience is improving and we don\u2019t see impact to that. We are delighted with the significant productivity initiatives undertaken by the team.", "We mentioned on the last call that there were a variety of things they were doing to drive improved labor efficiency. We have seen those gains sustained and that is driving the result you\u2019re seeing in terms of cost per labor hour.", "Greg Creed", "Joe, just to build on that, I think the scores that we get suggest that we have not impacted the customer experience but equally, Roger Eaton spent a week in China as the COO, touring a lot of stores. And then, obviously Micky has also been out in a number of the markets in a number of the tiers also visiting the stores. And his feedback or both their feedback to me was, this is not impacting the customer experience. So, I think given Roger -- having been the world-class operator and now running the KFC brand and Micky, their first hand experience gives me confidence that I can trust the numbers that we are getting, which is that we are not impacting the customer experience.", "So, I think there is this -- it\u2019s interesting coming from either two what you call high labor markets, certainly Australia, probably a very high labor market in the U.S., there has always been this thing that when labor is cheap, you tend to use too much. And I am not the world-class operator, but that\u2019s sort of been my observation. So, I think what we are doing is we are using mature what I\u2019d call mature market productivity. And this was something that Roger really championed as the COO which was to take all the learnings from markets like Australia where minimum wages are like $17, $18, and apply the same rigor even though the labor is cheap to apply the absolute same rigor transactions per labor hour and all this sort of stuff that he has brought to China. So, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re doing all the right things; I\u2019m very confident we are not negatively impacting the customer experience based on these productivity gains.", "Steve Schmitt", "And Joe, the first question you asked -- this is Steve, around the mix of the comp transactions for the division were down about 3 points. So, we got about 5 points combined from pricing and mix benefit.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Karen Short", "I just want to try to understand something, so I guess I\u2019m hearing two comments that I guess I think are somewhat contradictory. I think you seem to believe that the higher margin structure in China is sustainable but also have indicated that you need to have a greater focus on value, both at KFC and Pizza Hut. So, I\u2019m wondering if you could just maybe give a little color on those, both?", "Greg Creed", "I think from a -- I\u2019ll talk about it from a brand and marketing perspective. I\u2019ll use two examples; obviously, one is Taco Bell. We have the lowest average prices and probably the highest margins. But the second one and more relevant one would be a market like KFC Australia. In KFC Australia, we have average unit volumes around $2.3 million. This year, our sales growth is about 9%. We are obviously in a very high labor market, but yet we\u2019ve got margins in the high-teens. And so, we leverage obviously the sales that we\u2019ve got; we are very smart around how we put these box meals and these day of the week specials together. We\u2019ve become a lot more sophisticated around our pricing metrics and analysis on how to execute. And even in the box meals, driving a lot of drink into the box meals actually improves the perception of the box meal but also improves the margin.", "So, I think we\u2019ve got clear brand positioning. We know and we\u2019ve demonstrated in markets like Australia that we can have disruptive value and high-teen margins. And I think that Micky is taking all that knowledge and applying that to the China business.", "Steve Schmitt", "And the other thing I would say Karen just to build what Greg has said is that we know that the biggest driver of margin improvement for China long-term, to get us back to the 20% range which we still believe is a reasonable target and will be achieved is transaction leverage in the business. Because you have to bear in mind the extent of the transaction losses of the last couple of years. And so as we restore average unit volumes to where they were in 2012 which will happen at some stage then there\u2019s significant upside in the business. And I would say even more so in light of all of the significant productivity gains that the team has delivered over the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles", "Most of my questions were asked, but Pat, can you just give the pushes and pulls in the China margins that you\u2019ve provided in the past?", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly; very happy to do that. So, as you know, margins improved by about 5 percentage points for the quarter, productivity drove about 3.5 points of margin improvement, and then our pricing actions in the quarter drove about another 2.5 margin points. Offsetting that was inflation, which shaved off a 1.5 margin and then the transaction decline as Steve referenced, which took off about another point. And then we had about 1 point of benefit from other things, including lapping an inventory provision from last year.", "Andrew Charles", "Was the productivity really related to labor?", "Pat Grismer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Greg, I guess with the backdrop of the 90% plus franchise model around the rest of the world that you talked about, clearly I think people appreciate the high margin annuity stream of royalty income that generates. And being that Greg you came from Taco Bell had that stability, I\u2019m just wondering whether you could talk, at least holistically rather than any plans you might have or would ever consider but if you could refranchise the entire China business or the China portfolio today, it would still allow you to kind of participate in China and participate in the growth. But what would be the pros and cons? I mean it just seems like the China volatility just remains so outsized and the franchise model is so much appreciated, I\u2019m just wondering how you size up the pros and cons if you were able to do something like that.", "Greg Creed", "Well, Jeff, it was a nice try. I think that as you know, as you said, outside of China and India, we are currently 90% franchised; we are moving to 95%. As I said earlier, I think that our key objective or my key objective is to take three global brands and make them global iconic brands with all the things that we\u2019ve talked about. And then I think the decision about whether we run them or we put them in the hands of a franchisee is really not what this is all about. The value is really in the value of the three brands. So, obviously if you -- to hypothetically answer your question, the cons are that you would lose leverage, but the pro is that everything the franchisee pays for and you get a fee. So, I think there\u2019s nothing new around why you would franchise or why you wouldn\u2019t franchise. And that\u2019s why as I said earlier, my focus is on getting the brands in all the countries, improving in their performance, making them iconic, and doing all the things that I\u2019ve talked about that I know we need to do and I know that we can do in order to get this thing. But in any case, as I said, we obviously consider all alternatives. And the focus right now is on getting this business back on track.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney of Hedgeye Risk Management. Your line is open.", "Howard Penney", "I have two questions. The first one is when you were going through your three-quarter routine whatever that may be, did you think the stock was going to be down and did you think it was going to be down as much as it is? And then the second question is on the China strategy. I understand you laid out the case if you will for China and why you want to continue to grow in China -- not that you can\u2019t continue to grow in China. But it sort of feels like and I apologize for this analogy because I can\u2019t think of a better one kind of a [indiscernible] China-shop strategy in the sense that the economy has gone from 10% to 7% to 6%, and probably going to 3%. And you\u2019ve got volatility in currency and the stock market causing volatility to your business. Do you have an internal economist or somebody that is guiding you on what\u2019s going to happen in China for the next five years in saying the economy is going to go from 6% to 9% or -- I still don\u2019t understand -- I understand the consuming class is growing in China, but I guess I don\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t heard from you a reason why ownership and owning those assets in China is still the right way to go. Because it feels like China is headed in one direction and yet you are going in another.", "Greg Creed", "Why don\u2019t I have a first crack at it? Obviously I have no idea what\u2019s going to happen to the share price. If I could predict that, I\u2019d be a very wealthy man. So, I\u2019m going to leave that to others to do.", "I think on the question of what\u2019s happening in China, look, we are in 126 countries around the world. And in these 126 countries, we have either growth, no growth; lots of competition, no competition. I mean, value is important and there is so many permutations and combinations. I think in China, we\u2019ve still got growth in China that\u2019s still greater than it is in most of the markets we operate.", "We do believe that the consuming class will go from about 300 million people to 600 million people by 2020. And whilst we can certainly look at the competitiveness of the China market compared to a few years ago, if I compare that to the competitiveness of the market in the United States, it\u2019s not even close. So, I\u2019m still bullish on China. I still believe it\u2019s a place that we can get significant growth both for ourselves and for our shareholders. And I think we are still on the ground floor of what is a huge opportunity. How we take advantage of that opportunity. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll decide over time. But the most important thing is to position these two brands to capture all the potential growth that we can.", "Pat Grismer", "And Howard, just to build on that, I think what you are highlighting is the difference between a short-term perspective and a long-term perspective and we\u2019ve always taken a long-term perspective on our business. And our thesis on China and its long-term growth potential is unchanged, notwithstanding the significant volatility we\u2019ve seen in the market and that our brands have experienced in the last couple of years. Because I mentioned we do take a close look at investment returns. Our paybacks on -- our cash paybacks on new units remain in the range of three to four years. It\u2019s an attractive investment return opportunity for our shareholders.", "And, as Greg mentioned, our focus is on continuing to drive significant improvements in the business. We have new leadership in place to help deliver that. And so we remain optimistic for the long-term. And as we\u2019ve said many times over, despite the challenges we\u2019ve experienced, we wouldn\u2019t trade places with anybody. We have leading brands in the world\u2019s largest growing economy and we are on the ground floor of growth.", "Howard Penney", "So, if you don\u2019t mind, can I just try asking the same question again? So, the China economy has gone from -- the last four years, call it beginning of 2012 from 10%, I don\u2019t have these numbers right from 10% to 6%. And you\u2019ve opened 3,000 units over the same timeframe and your stock has gone nowhere. And if the China economy goes from 6% to 3% and you open up 3,000 units, are you going to be able to turn -- with the economy declining at an accelerating rate, are you going to be able to turn this business around in that environment?", "Greg Creed", "I mean, the way I would answer is we\u2019ve had two incidents, two massive incidents in China, which obviously we are still recovering from. We\u2019ve got a new leader in place who as I said has a fresh perspective and who knows what proven ideas have worked in other parts of the world for both KFC and Pizza Hut. He is already and the team there are already starting to put a lot of that into test, and we\u2019ll continue to do more of that in the fourth quarter and going forward. And I think that when we get to December, we\u2019ll be able to update you on just the progress that those tests are making. We won\u2019t have a massive sort of result changes in a revolutionary sense, but I do believe the huge -- the sheer amount of testing that is now going to happen in China, and the process and the discipline that we are reapplying to that testing in China, I look forward to being able to present with Micky to everybody in December.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Barbula of JPMorgan.", "John Ivankoe", "It\u2019s John Ivankoe. I think you just touched on this in the previous question, but I wanted to get a sense of how Micky was really going to run the business differently than Sam. Certainly, Sam would\u2019ve told us years ago, sharpening the focus of the brands is something that he probably would\u2019ve always done. And I think it would have been assumed by everyone on the call that the idea that China was putting in products made for the Chinese consumer that were proven successful elsewhere in the world, would have always been done, not just in the past three years, but probably in the last 15 years. So what I wanted to get a sense and Greg, I guess you\u2019d probably be the best person to answer this is, how much really is going to tactically change with Micky running the market versus Sam running the market? Not just from a tactical product development and brand focus point of view but even how the China market is managed and structured. In other words, are we a little bit too early to be talking about a complete reorganization in terms of who does what in the organization? And do you think that\u2019s something that in fact should be executed in the relatively near-term?", "Pat Grismer", "I think Micky has been on the ground for less than six weeks. I mean he came over with us after the Sam retirement announcement. And he has stayed there. So, he and I have obviously been in constant contact. So the first thing is obviously he is looking at the business through new eyes. I think that\u2019s the most important thing. That\u2019s what you always get when you get a new leader. Secondly, whether the business is performing good, bad or indifferent, there\u2019s always unfinished business to look at. I do think that the always original positioning around KFC that Micky has led around the world, we are going to bring to China with a tweak of always original, always Chinese. I think the discussions I\u2019ve had with him around we probably need to simplify the menu, get more focus back on the core products introduce this disruptive value that\u2019s worked elsewhere. And I think in a brand positioning sense, play more offense.", "So, I would say that look, it is really early days. I\u2019d probably -- he and I are in constant dialogue. But he has new eyes. He\u2019s got seasoned professional eyes. And so he sees the business as he\u2019s looked through the businesses that have performed elsewhere. We know we\u2019ve got unfinished business. We know we have to make the positioning clearer. We both believe we need more disruptive value, and we have to start playing offense when it comes to brand positioning; all of that.", "John Ivankoe", "And with respect, Greg, I mean that sounds like the kind of things that a CMO would do or perhaps the president of the brand would do but the CEO job for the CEO of China -- the job, the scale, the responsibilities is -- it\u2019s much bigger than marketing and positioning. So, if you could talk about the organization, how it\u2019s run, what the responsibilities are, how it\u2019s structured, what have you?", "Greg Creed", "As I said, his job right now is turning around the business. So, I don\u2019t care whether he\u2019s the president, the CEO, the CMO or whoever he is. He and I both realize that what we\u2019ve got to do is turn around the sales and transactions of this business. And so, those are the roles that he has really focused on in his first whatever 30 or 40 days that he\u2019s been there. He and I pretty much talk almost every day.", "Now, will we get to structure in China? And does he have the right structure? And has he got the right people? Look, we\u2019ve got a seasoned leadership team there that has a new leader that\u2019s looking at the business through new eyes. And I think you can call it whatever you want to call it, but I think he\u2019s doing all the right things. And certainly the feedback I\u2019m getting from the other team in China is that they think he\u2019s doing all the right things. And certainly the things that I know he is putting into test, he has my full support on. In fact, those are the things that he and I talk about pretty much on a daily basis. So, getting sales and transactions turned around is his number one priority.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy of Morningstar. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy", "One final follow-up question on brand positioning and I respect that you can\u2019t give away all the internal metrics that you used to measure brand\u2019s strength. But I was wondering if you could give us a little of at least direction or color on what metrics and what gives you confidence that the brand perception hasn\u2019t diminished in China? I think that would be particularly helpful.", "Greg Creed", "I think a lot of the customer metrics that we measure are obviously making progress since the two supplier incidents. I think the one that we have not made the progress on that we need to make progress on is value. So, I think that as the economy turns, as the macros become tougher, and your value score is the one that\u2019s probably lagging in a recovery sense, I think it indicates that we need to play disruptive value more aggressively. But I want to reassure everybody not at the expense of margin because we do know how to do this and we\u2019ve done it successfully in many other markets. So, do we continue to improve our metrics on food safety, favorite QSR brand, trustworthy all of our brands? Yes, we do. But on value for money, we clearly have a lot more work to do.", "So, any more questions?", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks R.J.", "Greg Creed", "So, I want to thank everyone for being on the call. I think it goes without saying we\u2019ve obviously had a very disappointing quarter. And as I said, I and we and everyone at Yum! take responsibility for it. I think what I don\u2019t want you to do is count us as out. We will come back. And as I said earlier, this is really up to us to execute. We know what we\u2019ve got to do. We\u2019ve got to have very clear brand positioning. We have got to have innovation that is driven from insides. We\u2019ve got to have disruptive value. We\u2019ve got to be strong and great in the whole social mobile digital space. We\u2019ve got to upgrade our assets. And we\u2019ve got to deliver a superior customer experience. We know what we have to do. What we all know we have to do is execute better than we\u2019ve done.", "The long-term potential for this business is huge whether it\u2019s emerging markets, developed markets, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is. We have three great brands. We are going to turn these into three great global iconic brands and take advantage of all the emerging opportunities that exist for us.", "So, it\u2019s on us. Yes, there\u2019s some macro headwinds and yes other things happening, but at the end of the day, around the world, I know what we have to do to be successful. In a number of the markets where we do that, we are incredibly successful. What we\u2019ve got to do is not just do it in a number of markets; we\u2019ve got to do it in every market including China in which we participate.", "And I can absolutely assure you, everybody at Yum! knows we have disappointed you and our shareholders this quarter and this year, and we are going to come back stronger and better than ever.

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy. Sir, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, Tom. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, CEO; and Pat Grismer, CFO. Also on today's call is Larry Gathof, Yum!'s Treasurer who will be participating in Q&A. Following remarks from Greg and Pat, we'll take your questions.", "I want to thank all of you who joined us in Texas for our Investor Conference in December. I would like to remind everyone that the presentations from this conference are available on our website.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.

Investor Events, our first quarter 2016 earnings will be released on Wednesday, April 20th.", "And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased that you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results.", "Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day in December. 2016 will be a transformational year for Yum!, as we complete the spinoff of our China division, ultimately creating two powerful independent focus growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum! however is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world as strong brand critical to delivering the same growth and creating shareholder value over the long-term.", "I\u2019m pleased with the positive sales momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! In the fourth quarter. KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. This was a sequential improvement from the third quarter and in line with our expectations. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a one and two-year basis. Our U.S. results in the fourth quarter were particularly strong for all three brands, as KFC posted six consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth. Taco Bell continued to outperform the category and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2%.", "On a tuning basis our fourth quarter comps in the U.S. were the best of the year with Pizza Hut at plus 2%, KFC at plus 8%, and Taco Bell at plus 10%. These successes complemented our international results in the quarter where KFC posted 2% same store sales growth with solid results in both emerging and developed markets and Pizza Hut grew same store sales 3% in emerging markets.", "Fourth-quarter EPS grew 11%, with full-year EPS growth of 3% in 2015 despite a 7% decline in the first half and 6 percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, which is in line with our ongoing growth model targets. This was led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell, a remarkable result given the significant investments we made in the fourth quarter to position the brand for continued momentum and category leadership for the years to come.", "Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally expected sales results. We added more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015 and as I look forward out to 2016 to be a year of improved performance building on the fourth quarter's momentum. This year we expect to open nearly 2,400 new restaurants, which means we\u2019re opening over six restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we initially gave you in December. Given the results we have seen year-to-date and the plans we have laid out for each of the brands, we're confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016.", "Now I'd like to discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our businesses. After that Pat will walk you through the financials. So first China, as I mentioned, KFC which represents about 75% of the division's operating profit grew same store sales 6% in the fourth quarter continuing the sequential improvement we saw throughout the year. System sales grew 9% in the quarter as we added 114 net new units, so crossing the 5,000 unit mark. I'm thrilled the China team is applying global best practices, fresh thinking and new insights to revitalize the brand and achieve attraction with consumers.", "Early test results of proven global sales volume package are encouraging and the implementation of this program should drive transactions and benefit the division later this year. One example is box meals which has proven successful globally and we expect to be similarly well received in China. I can assure you we are taking the right steps to grow the business and the momentum we are seeing makes me confident, we will.", "Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China which represents -- has represented about 25% of China's operating profit, has proven more challenging. System sales in constant-currency grew 4% in the fourth quarter, as we added 151 net new units, but same-store sales declined 8%. The macroeconomic environment and volatile stock market has impacted the Casual Dining segment and we know we have to generate more exciting news and value to counter this headwind. We'll be more focused on value going forward with work day lunch specials and value pieces as well as other initiatives to drive traffic. We have our work cut out for us here and we'll be moderating our redundant pace a bit this year. Nevertheless the China team has a number of strategies and concepts in test that we expect to improve results. We now have substantial run rate for new units and same store sales growth for China's leading western Casual Dining brands.", "Before I move on to the other divisions I want to give you a quick update on January sales in China. We are encouraged by what we are seeing at KFC, but Pizza Hut sales remain soft. It's difficult to gauge exactly where the first quarter will finish, especially given the earlier timing of Chinese New Year. But at this point we expect same-store sales growth to be up low-single digits for the division which sets us up well for the balance of the year. We expect solid KFC sales going forward and even with the potential of negative results at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in the first half we are reconfirming our full year guidance for the China division to generate same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%, operated profit growth of 10% in constant-currency and to open 600 new restaurants.", "Now turning to our three brand divisions, KFC is a franchise led emerging power house. Franchisees opened 85% of our 705 new international restaurants in 2015. Total system sales grew 11% in emerging markets for the year with particular strength in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. In fact Russia has generated system sales growth of at least 40% in each of the last four years. I'm also encouraged by our recent performance in developed markets such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These results reinforce my confidence in the brand's ability to drive sales going forward. We don't only have an ability to generate meaningful growth in mature markets where we have a long established presence; we also have tremendous potential in emerging markets where we have a significant lead over the competition. So, we are taking our global brand identity and unifying that with local cultural insights to expand and grow our business pull around the world. We are 100% focused on our real, authentic and freshly prepared food and merging that with value and innovation to drive results.", "On the international front, we've enjoyed success with lunch and dinner box meals and we're delighted by the ideas created in the United States are finding their way into the system. For example we just introduced Nashville Hot in the U.S., this is a spicy version of our crispy chicken inspired by one of Nashville's most famous dishes. The New Year pipeline at KFC remains impressive. In KFC's top 12 emerging markets, excluding China, we only have one restaurant for a 1 million people. Today with an aggregate population of 3 billion people in these markets, think of the potential. Across the world we have plans in place to grow sales and to build on the division's consistent operating growth performance. I'm confident KFC will continue to excel and reward shareholders for years to come.", "At Pizza Hut U.S. we are starting to turn the corner with our focused emphasis on making it easier to get a better pizza. This runs the gamut from improved operations and insight driven food innovation to digital enhancements and consistent value. While we recognize there's a lot more work to do, we are now generating consistent public transactions and same-store sales growth in the United States. Equally significant and as you heard in December, we reached an important agreement with our U.S. franchisees. Starting in January we began overhaul of our assets replacing ovens and upgrading in-store technology. From a marketing calendar perspective we are focused on a balanced approach. This begins with premium product innovation such as our recent launch of Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza to protect and improve unit level economics. You may also have seen the launch of our $5 Flavor Menu, the most compelling value menu in the pizza business.", "In conjunction with our ongoing $6.99 any pairs deal, it will provide our customers with great value on an ongoing basis. We are encouraged by the solid year at Pizza Hut in United States and we believe we have the right strategy going forward. Our international business at Pizza Hut is led by strength in emerging markets but offset by weakness in some of our developed markets. We believe we can apply best practices from the U.S. business to drive growth in these developed markets going forward.", "Finally Taco Bell delivered a fantastic 2015 surpassing $9 billion in system sales and we expect a solid year in 2016 as well. Taco Bell is on the cutting edge of QSR and it again received gold standard for social engagement, product development, brand positioning and advertising. We have several new exciting products launching this year including one we'll announce during the Super Bowl. So, be sure to watch the first half to see the national introduction. Our innovation focus extends beyond just food. We are encouraged by early results of our delivery program and our developing expansion plans for additional cities. The addition of our loyalty program in November built on our mobile app and will increase brand affinity as it rewards social behavior.", "So furthermore we are focused on our core value messaging to drive transactions. We continue to build on our breakfast daypart where sales are growing at twice the rate of our business as a whole, in fact we grew breakfast transactions 6% in the fourth quarter. Given the brand's strong economics and broad franchise appeal, we continue to accelerate New Year openings both domestically and internationally, with a record number of U.S. openings in 2015 and we expect to build upon this in 2016.", "I am particularly excited that we're starting to some traction, expanding the brands internationally. We know this process will take time but we're making real progress here. Our growth spends both domestically and internationally will lay the ground work for higher operating profit growth in the years to come. With all this progress you can see why I am very excited about what's happening in our company. We are underlying the biggest strategic move in the history of Yum! with our spin-off of the China business. We are confident this will create two large optimally structured independent companies with unique investment profiles.", "Yum! China will target 50% ongoing EPS growth as it focuses solely on Mainland China and will pay the new Yum! a 3% license fee. New Yum! will become a high margin global franchise company targeting 15% shareholder return. Recapitalization plans are underway and will be completed in the first half of this year. We see substantial value in our shares at common prices as we have repurchased 23 million shares from the announcement of the separation through last night.", "I want to assure you that while the spin-off transaction is critically important, we're not going to let it distract us from running the business in China or anywhere else. All three of our brands have significant opportunities for growth as they progress along the journey to brand excellence. We expect to achieve 10% constant currency growth and operating profit this year as a company and are setting up two separate companies that will lead the restaurant industry going forward. Yum! is in a unique position. We have three iconic brands and are making them even stronger. As you've heard me say before, my goal as CEO is to build three global iconic brands that people trust and champion.", "We are well on our way to achieving this, led by our brand positioning, courageous leadership and committed team members and franchisees. Needless to say there is lot to be excited about Yum! and I could not be more pleased to lead this company into its next stage.", "And finally as you all know this is Pat's last earnings call with Yum! and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for his leadership, his hard work and an unwavering drive to raise the bar of Yum!. He will be missed across the organization. As you may have seen in our 8-K filings we have appointed our current Corporate Controller, Dave Russell, as interim CFO and I look forward to working with him, while we complete our search for a permanent CFO.", "And with that, it gives me great pleasure to hand the call over to Pat.", "Pat Grismer", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today I'll cover three areas; our fourth quarter results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on the separation of our China business. I too am pleased with the overall sales momentum that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter where EPS excluding special items grew 11%. Reported EPS growth was considerably higher as last year's fourth quarter included a non-cash special item charge related to the impairment of our Little Sheep concept in China. Excluding special items and the impact of foreign exchange, operating profit grew a healthy 17% in the fourth quarter led by system sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin improvement of over 3 percentage points.", "I'll now take you through our results by division, starting with our China business. For the division overall, same store sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter. As we pre-announced, KFC grew same store sales 6%, which was sequentially better than Q3 as we expected. We're encouraged by the positive momentum in our KFC China business particularly as it is sustained into the New Year. Same store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining however have remain sluggish and declined 8% in the fourth quarter. As Greg said, the China team is addressing this matter with urgency and we will update you on our progress through the year.", "Restaurant margin management continues to be a bright sport in China's performance. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margins more than 4 percentage points versus prior year to 11.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC and productivity improvements across the division more than offsetting sales to leverage at Pizza Hut. As a reminder, our fourth quarter is a seasonally low sales period for the China division, so the absolute restaurant margin tends to be lower at that time of year. Full year restaurant margin was 15.9% for the division an improvement of 1 full percentage point. It's not often that you see restaurant margins expand with declined sales, so this highlights the extent of the China team's efforts to improve profitability through cost controls.", "I am proud of the team's continued focus on productivity and confident this bodes well for further profit growth in China as same store sales continue to recover and unlock significant profit leverage in the business. Given our continued strong belief in China's long-term growth potential and encouraged by continued strong cash paybacks on new units, we opened 743 new restaurants in 2015. And while we're prudently dialing back the pace of the new unit development in 2016, targeting about 600 new restaurant openings, we also expect fewer closures this year. So our net new units will be similar to 2015.", "Our decision to temper the pace of development balances the reality of current market conditions with the opportunities we have to enter new trade zones and expand our presence in existing ones. We are also making good progress on modernizing our estate. In 2015, we remodeled about 500 restaurants in China, and we plan to remodel about another 550 in 2016. By the end of this year, we will have remodeled or newly built about 45% or nearly half of our China's estate in a three year period.", "Now moving to our global KFC division, which posted its eighth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets up 10% led by Russia and Southeast Asia. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth up 6% led by Australia, Japan and Western Europe. And the U.S. recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of same store sales growth at 3%. Restaurant margins grew 90 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and improved to 150 basis points for the year to nearly 15%.", "Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting this for the lap of a one-time favorable pension resolution as well as incremental advertising expense associated with our U.S. acceleration agreement, operating profit grew 11% in the quarter roughly in line with KFC's ongoing growth model. Importantly, KFC set another new record for international development in 2015 opening 705 new restaurants, demonstrating the power of this global iconic brand.", "Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 1% same store sales growth for the quarter led by 2% same store sales growth in our U.S. business, which accounts for about half of division system sales. Operating profit improved 6% in constant currency driven by higher franchise fees and higher restaurant margins, partially offset by an increase in U.S. G&A including severance and other one-time costs. Restaurant margins actually improved 240 basis points in constant currency for the quarter driven by same store sales leverage and commodity depletion. For the year Pizza Hut opened 429 new international units. While this was below our initial forecast for 2015, we now have a more robust development pipeline and are confident that we'll open at least 525 new international units in 2016.", "Finally, Taco Bell posted 4% same store sales growth in the quarter. Restaurant margin improved 3.1 percentage points to 23.7% raising full year margins to approximately 22%, a remarkable achievement for this power house brand. Operating profit however declined 7% in the fourth quarter due to an expected increase in G&A related to performance based incentive compensation, strategic growth investments including restaurant technology and international supply chain and other non-recurring costs. We believe these investments will strengthen the brand and help to sustain positive momentum in the business. As evidence of the one-time nature of these expenses, we actually expect Taco Bell's G&A will decline in 2016. Additionally, we expect restaurant margins to remain above 20%, even with our more aggressive push on value.", "On the development front, we opened 276 new stores in 2015. This included 41 units outside the U.S., four times the number we opened in 2014, demonstrating the progress we're making to ramp up international development. 87% of the division's new restaurants were opened by franchisees reflecting the attractive investment return the Taco Bell brand generates.", "I'd now like to talk about our 2016 outlook. Supported by the results we've seen year-to-date, we continue to expect to deliver operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency this year. And while I won't be providing quarterly guidance, I'd like to point out that certain brands are facing hurdles, both prior year laps and timing of current year expenses which will weigh on first half results. As a consequence we expect second half operating profit growth will be directionally stronger in the first half. This is consistent with our plans coming into the year and we remain confident we will achieve our full year operating profit guidance.", "Now I'd like to quickly cover our spin-off plans. We're making good progress and are on track to complete the separation of our China business by the end of this year. A major part of our plan is to optimize the capital structure of Yum! Brands and return $6.2 billion to shareholders prior to the separation to the issuance of new debt. From the time we announced the separation through last night, we've repurchased 23 million shares. While our weighted average basic share count for the quarter was 433 million, our basic share count as of February 2, 2016 was 411 million. We see value in repurchasing our shares in what we consider to be a discounted price and view this as a prudent use of shareholder capital.", "I'm also happy to report that we're on schedule to complete our recapitalization in the first half of the year, issuing incremental debt of approximately $5.2 billion and plan to maintain roughly 5 times EBITDA leverage going forward. We're now in the process of finalizing the form and timing of this financing. Now I'm sure you've noticed the volatility in the high-yield debt market particularly within the energy and materials sectors. We'll continue to watch this closely, but we're pleased that the rates on our future debt remains very attractive on a historic basis and we're coasting ahead with our plans.", "So, let me wrap things up, 2016 will be an exciting year for Yum! Brands. Not only do we expect to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency, but we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China division into an independent publicly traded company. Yum! China will have no external debt and will self fund growth capital, while generating significant free cash flow in year one and on an ongoing basis. The New Yum! will be a global diversified franchise company with an optimal capital structure. By 2017 we will be 96% franchised with a stable but fast growing free cash flow strength.", "I'm pleased I was able to participate in this landmark decision for the company and that we are optimizing shareholder value by creating two powerful investment opportunities. I'm very confident in both companies future growth prospects and look forward to their ongoing success.", "And with that I'll open the call to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass", "Pat first could I just follow-up on the question, comments you made about certain brands are facing certain hurdles in the first half. Well are these sales hurdles, profit hurdles, which brands, can you just directionally point us in the right direction so we can model in appropriately?", "Pat Grismer", "It is a combination of both sales and spending. Clearly in the case of Pizza Hut in China our expectations for the first half are more muted and we expect their sales recovery to improve in the back half of the year. So, that'll be around the first half results. At the same time we have spending in some of our global brand divisions that will be more heavily concentrated in the first half of the year and then in the second half of the year we'll be lapping some of the investments that were made in G&A and so that will contribute to the shape of earnings over the course of the year.", "John Glass", "How much did Pizza Hut China impact the margins this quarter, in other words, is there real bifurcation occurring? I assume there is but maybe you can quantify how much the weight that Pizza Hut is placing on the margin for China? And also can you just talk about why not -- is this the moment you start developing Pizza Hut delivery more aggressively, since that seems like there's a huge untapped opportunity at the same there's some issues obviously with the dine-in business?", "Pat Grismer", "Yes, first with respect to margins in China, I'm not going to bifurcate by brands but it is fair to say and as you've seen from the comps that we've reported that the sales performance at Pizza Hut Casual Dining was not as strong as for KFC in China. And that's largely due to more significant transaction declines in that business and so did weigh more heavily on Pizza Hut China margins in particular. And then with respect to development you're absolutely right, it's early days for the Pizza delivery business in China and so we will be picking up pace development for that particular concept as we look to temper the pace of development of both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining in 2016.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "David Palmer", "Just a question on the role of value at Pizza Hut China, could you just give us perhaps a little bit of a retrospective and looking forward about what value you need for that brand? Did Pizza Hut China really get away from the five star dining at three star prices in recent years, making it more vulnerable now? And can you share what you brought out so far and the sort of value you might be thinking about for the brand and do you think that's going to enough to offset the casual dining weakness in the country? Thanks.", "Greg Creed", "Sure, David. Well I think first of all, obviously the macros which have got worse since December, since we were all together in December and I think we all know that macros impact casual dining more than they impact QSR. So, I think there's definitely that issue. I would agree with you that we've not had enough value in use to overcome this backdrop. I think we've also as we've spoken out in previous calls, there is a lot of discussion around steak and fajitas and there wasn't as much discussion if you just think about around pizzas. And so I think our ability to talk value but to talk value around pizzas, I think you'll see more of that going forward. So, yes, the answer is we got to focus on the core to strengthen our brand positioning. We have got to target value to increase transactions such as smart value across daypart. We also have to I think improve our in-store experience in order to stay ahead with the competition. And I think the other thing we have got to be a leader in digital we got to say relevant. And I think there's a lot of things that we can do in that market as well. To I guess round out the answer, we've got about five value programs in test for Pizza Hut in China. We're going to see some early encouraging results but that's going to take us some time to get into the marketplace and as Pat I said I think you'll see a much better second half than you'll see first half out of Pizza Hut China.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner from UBS. Your line is open.", "Keith Siegner", "Two quick questions, sorry folks, the first one being when we look at the success of the three global brands particularly here in the U.S. in recent quarter on both sales and margins perspective, how should we think about that margin trajectory into this year? We've got easing costs, we've got very intense competition, how do we think about the margins for those three segments this year? And then to follow that up, can you give us an update on the plans to refranchise those three brands, the plan to go from 91% to 95% by the end of '17, how is that progressing? And maybe to be some extent how does the success of those brands recently impact that refranchising effort? Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly, Keith. First in terms of margin performance in the three global brands, bear in mind our equity ownership in those three global brand businesses I think collectively is in the order of 10%, so it's a franchise driven business. But nonetheless we do focus on restaurant margins both for the benefit of our company as stated and importantly to ensure that our franchisees are realizing good returns on their investments. I would say overall we're pleased with the progress we're making on margins for our KFC global division to improve about 1 percentage point versus last year was quite a significant accomplishment, a combination of same store sales growth and productivity improvements contributing to that. At Pizza Hut equally happy with the progress we've made this year to your point supported by the commodity inflation as well as in the last quarter some sales growth. And then for Taco Bell another banner year with restaurant margins on a full year basis, we are on 22%. As we build on that momentum into next year, we are expecting our KFC and our Pizza Hut businesses to continue to realize margin improvement aided by same store sales leverage as well as more modest commodity outlook than we've seen in some years before. In the case of Taco Bell, my expectation is that margins will be up above 20% perhaps a bit below where they were in this year because of the more aggressive push on value and a more temperate approach to pricing. And then in terms of the refranchising, the teams are very much committed to realizing the objectives that we laid out to achieve 96% franchise ownership by the end of 2017. In the last 30 days Greg and I have met with each one of the global brand divisions to review their refranchising plans and their very discreet plans around specific geographies and pacing associated with that. Given the complexity of some these transactions, we would expect the refranchising activity will be more heavily concentrated in 2017.", "Greg Creed", "Can I just add a point on the brands, just want to build on the point, Keith you asked. What I am really excited about, and I guess this is in Southeast Asia in January is that the positioning for the three global brands is really starting to be -- I am starting to see it on a global basis. So there is always original KFC whether it's this whole idea that we need to make it easier to get better at Pizza Hut and obviously a holding month at Taco Bell. I happened to be in Thailand, about less than two months after we sort of rolled out, need to make to easier to get better at Pizza Hut, I am in Bangkok and I am seeing really focused plans about what we have to do to get better and what we do to make it easy. So I think the thing I am really encouraged about is now that we have got this positioning clear for the three brands. It's the pace at which I am seeing that appear in the markets in 126 countries that we authorize that's giving me encouragement that we can continue to drive same store sales growth going forward.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler from CLSA. Your line is open.", "Diane Geissler", "I just have a question on the new unit development and maybe just more a clarification. So when we think about the units that you're opening in China this year, can you give us a breakdown between KFC and Pizza Hut and then as the Pizza Hut slowdown just in your model is it temporary or is it more a shift from actual buying into delivery units?", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly, Diane. When we look at the 740 or so that we opened this year, about 350 were KFC, 280 at Pizza Casual Dining and the balance split between the Pizza Home Service and Little Sheep. When we look out to 2016 and our expectation of around 600 new unit openings, that\u2019s about 20% reduction. That about 20% reduction applies almost equally to KFC and the Pizza Hut. So we're looking at deceleration in the pace of development for both KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. And we don't expect that, that is an indication of how things are going to play out much longer term. It's just that as I mentioned in my prepared remarks earlier, given current market conditions, we feel that it's prudent to dial back in that but we continue to be very confident in the value we will create from these investments as we're continuing to see cash payback to around three years and we know the long-term growth potential of the market remains significant. So we do expect that at some point in time the pace of development will increase for all brands.", "Greg Creed", "I think the discussions that I have been having with Micky are really around, we still see 20,000 plus restaurants on the horizon as an opportunity. I think that we still believe in the growth story of China, the consuming class, the EPS, the economics not what they used to be but it's still better than most other places in the world. And I think as we get these brands fully positioned and we get back to doing the things that we've spoken about that we need to do. I think long-term we remain still committed that this is at least in what I'll call my horizon 20,000 restaurant unit opportunity for the China business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse", "Hi, thank you for the question. You guys, I was surprised to see a tick down into your conference in emerging markets, at KFC and a little bit more material at Pizza Hut, particularly in light of commentary about strength in Russia, strength in Eastern Europe. I am curious if there is any particular regions of the world you would point to that are causing a little bit of softness there and what might be causing that?", "Pat Grismer", "Karen, what I'd highlight for both KFC and for Pizza Hut in terms of the emerging markets which remain strong overall given what we're seeing by way of system sales growth is that the same store sales growth has probably been a bit below our expectations for some of the emerging markets in South East Asia.", "Karen Holthouse", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Thank you very much. Actually just two restaurant margin questions. One in China, Pat, I think you said for this full year it was 59 plus 100 basis points and that was quite impressive considering the sales decline. As we think about 2016 and you talk about 2% to 3% comp growth, I'm wondering, why perhaps the guidance? I think you've mentioned in the past maybe 15% plus margin in '16. Wondering why it wouldn't be significantly higher if presumably due to those positive comps? And maybe you can offer some food and labor commentary. And a similar question on Taco Bell, I mean Keith said right, greater than 20% margin in '16 but down from '15 it sounds like there is a big value push perhaps coming. So I'm wondering, if you guys can just talk a little about the category, with a little bit discounting going on seems to have intensified of late and where Taco Bell is well positioned to respond to that. Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly, and we'll start with China. We finished the year from a margin perspective in China stronger than we'd expected. And so our current expectation is that margins in 2016 will be about in line with 2015, so around 16%. As you mentioned we're expecting to realize some benefit from same store sales growth but we're taking I'd say a more tempered approach to pricing, given the focus on value as the team's emphasis is on building transactions, building healthy transactions. And so that may mean that we wouldn't take pricing that we might have in the past to fully offset inflation and we'll be much happier with an outcome where we'd build transactions with that margin, as opposed to growing margins. And so that's the outlook for China. As it relates to Taco Bell, I'd say things are a little bit similar in the sense that the emphasis will be on value to build on a great momentum we had in 2015. We are expecting modest inflation I'd say probably more than we've realized historically in the labor category for our company stores. We're anticipating there could be some movement in wage rates and I'd say modest outlook on commodity inflation for the Taco Bell business.", "Greg Creed", "Just let me talk to about whole question about value, I think the great thing is that Taco Bell is incredibly well positioned, it remains the value leader. But look, we've all seen what's been happening in the marketplace in the early year: five for $4, four for $4, two for $2, so let's not kid ourselves. So, there's been a fair amount of value initially out there. So as you would expect from a well positioned brand, they are back looking at the calendar, I think you'll see some changes that will come out. Obviously they have got this great new product launch coming out on Sunday, so I think that will have a positive impact on the brand. They will do the right thing and I'll make sure that they continue to be well positioned in the value leader in the marketplace going forward that's what you should expect great brands to do.", "Jeffrey Bernstein", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner", "Thanks, guys. I've two questions, first is on China, kind of following up. In the fourth quarter you did have great margin leverage again and operating profit growth of almost 200% on a 2% comp and you're expecting similar comps going forward as you had in the fourth quarter. So can you just talk again a little bit more about what investments are being made in China that are going to keep the margin and profit growth more in check as your guidance kind of suggests? And then I do have a follow up.", "Pat Grismer", "Well, first in terms of China margin for 2016, as I mentioned there will be much stronger emphasis on value in order to simulate traffic and as a consequence we're not necessarily expecting that pricing will fully offset inflation. What we're expecting by way of inflation in 2016 is about 1% for food and high single-digits for labor, but again we're not expecting to fully offset that to pricing, as maybe has been our past practice, as the team is refocusing on building transactions. We're counting on continued productivity improvements probably not the heroic improvements that we've seen in years past. If we do better than 2% to 3% comps in 2016, we would expect margins to improve but we're not planning for that right now. The other variable though is labor efficiency, because the team let's face it has consistently surprised us to the upside and that could provide further tailwind to China margins in 2016. We think at this stage guiding about flat margins year-over-year, is appropriate.", "Brian Bittner", "That make sense. And then the second question just on the pending recap that you expect to be completed here in the first half. You said at the Investor Day that you are targeting 5.25% blended interest rate, is that still an achievable targeted rate as you stand here today?", "Larry Gathof", "Yes, Brian. It's Larry Gathof. As Pat mentioned, the markets have been very volatile and spreads definitely have widened across the market. That said, there's a lot of bifurcation in the market. The good credits are still getting done at fairly good and attractive rates, especially on historic basis. So it really depends on exactly what we execute and we're evaluating and doing some specifics around both the tenure of the debt and the types of the debt we've put out there. So the 5.25% I would say was still in the game, but it's probably 5.25% or plus, not on the lower end of that at this point.", "Pat Grismer", "And Brian, that 5.25% that we referenced was for the entire debt portfolio of Yum!, not just the incremental debt. So just wanted to make that clear. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John Ivankoe", "A question on China margins. Obviously you guys were happy with margins, given the comps in 2015. You were happy with the levels in the fourth quarter as well. But the question that has to continue to be asked and certainly we've been asking it for the last couple of years; to what extent that attention to cost controls, labor efficiency, other OpEx efficiency, what have you, has actually in some way contributed to the lack of traffic recovery that you guys have consistently expected? So I just want to see whatever research or information, anything qualitative, quantitative that you may have to make everyone comfortable that you haven't gone too far. And in that context, is some of the guidance on China margins in 2016 an admission that there are no more structural cost cuts or tactical cost cuts that exist within the China system and that margins are really now going to be a function of comps?", "Greg Creed", "Let me just start with that one. I will take that. I think the -- certainly the customer metrics -- certainly on KFC, the customer metrics are now back pre the incident, so I think it doesn't matter what metrics you look at. I would say all of those metrics are obviously way back. In an absolute sense, the Pizza Hut metrics are actually higher than the KFC metrics. Probably haven't regained as much momentum, but they are in an absolute sense higher. I think the other thing, just to address your question, is there's a lot of work being done on menu simplification as well. And so I think what we've got to do is, obviously besides looking at labor and other costs that go into it, is how do we simplify the menu so that we make it easier for the customer to speed up the experience? In KFC's case or in Pizza Hut's case, I think, you know, really deliver the best casual dining in-store experience in order to stay ahead. So there's a number of initiatives around simplified menu boards, box meals make it actually easier for the customer to order rather than standing in queue and lining up. So we're spending a lot of time making sure that the margin improvements do not impact the customer experience. And all of the evidence that I can see suggests that there is no impact on the customer experience. And Micky has the bit between the teeth on improving the speed of service, particularly in KFC. And there's a number of initiatives in place that I think will actually enhance that experience, enhance throughput, and obviously lead to sales and transaction growth.", "Pat Grismer", "And John, what I would add to what Greg has said is that we continue to believe that long term, 20% is an appropriate margin target for the China business. And you have to think about that in the context of where average unit volumes are today and where we know they can go. We're not putting a time frame on it, but we know that there is enormous profit leverage in the business, given all the productivity gains that have been made in the last two to three years. And that as the same-store sales continue to recover, we will see significant margin improvement. To your point, that is from comps, but I also wouldn't underestimate the opportunity for the China team to continue to realize some structural improvements in the business. They've consistently delivered well beyond our expectations. They have enormous capability, and I think that the next leg of productivity improvement in the restaurants will be unlocked by technology. And it's fair to say that the digital capabilities of our China business are the best that we have in our entire company. We are all very excited about how that's going to transform the customer experience and that will unlock further productivity opportunity in our restaurants and contribute to that improving margin over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "David Tarantino", "My question is on the Pizza Hut business in China. And I know this might be hard question to answer, but I was wondering, if there is any way you can dissect how much of the comps weakness you've seen recently is more related to macro issues versus internal issues? And I guess said differently, is there any benchmarks within that market that you're looking at that would say you are underperforming or over performing relative to the industry there? And then I have a follow-up.", "Greg Creed", "Okay, David, let me take one. We don't have obviously the sort of information we have in the U.S. We don't have credit and MPD data to try and get to the specifics that you're asking. I think we all know -- and we've seen this not just in China, but outside that casual dining is impacted by macros. It's just what happens. And it always has a bigger impact on casual dining when macros are volatile and changing than it does on the QSR business. So if I were to say what are the four factors, I would say macros. I think the second one would be not having enough value news in order to overcome this sort of macro backdrop, which is why we've got a number of macro tests in the marketplace right now. And obviously with a sense of urgency, we need to get these tests into the marketplace. I think there is definitely competition. There's definitely more competition in the marketplace. I don't think a lot of this competition is going to try and scale up on the broad scale like Pizza Hut is. And then I think that the last thing or the last point or factor I think would be aggregators, but that's a small percentage of total sales. So I would say it's macro, it's value, it's competition, and it's aggregators. That would be -- I can't put a percentage on for you. I know you would like it, but those would be the four factors. And that's why our response has to be focus on the core to strengthen the brand positioning, target value increased transactions, deliver the best in-store dining experience. And then leading digital, as Pat said, whether it's free Wi-Fi, queue ticketing, pre-ordering, and then partnerships with people like Alipay and WeChat to drive cashless payment as well as the loyalty program. So that's the things we're doing in response to the four things we see driving the performance we're not happy with in Pizza Hut China.", "David Tarantino", "Great. And I guess the follow-up to that -- that's very helpful. But the follow-up is if it ends up being mostly macro, it seems like you are swimming into a pretty stiff current on some of this. How much contingency have you built into the plans, if the Pizza Hut business doesn't stabilize as you expect in the second half?", "Greg Creed", "Well, I think there's two things. First of all, we do have a number of tests, so I don't want anyone to go away thinking that we haven't developed a number of test scenarios. Now, I think the difference between KFC and Pizza Hut is, in KFC we can draw on proven ideas from the other 100 countries we've got KFC. There's less opportunity to do that, but I can assure you that Micky and the team are really focused on what I would call these value platforms being tested and obviously what we're trying to resolve the impacts. We need to see positive sales impacts and I think some of the early day test results suggest we're seeing sales impacts in these tests somewhere between plus 1% to plus 7%. So we've still got a long way to go. We've got to get them into the real world, but I am at least optimistic with what I'm seeing in the tests. But this is a hard slog. This is definitely a lot harder than KFC in China. We're going to have to work really hard, but we've got the right team in order to come up with the right ideas to overcome all the values that even macros or competitors put in our way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Karen Short", "So a couple questions on Pizza Hut. I guess your U.S. comp seemed to come in at the low end of expectations, at least as you stated at your December Analyst Day and international is a little uninspiring. So first question is any color as to why? And then I guess two related questions would be, you outlined the path to achieving a 3% comp at Pizza Hut at the Analyst Day with various initiatives, but it seems a little optimistic on a blended basis. And then the last portion of the question is there any way to accelerate the common POS conversion? Because it seems like one common system might really be the backbone that you would need before comps can really re-accelerate. Thanks.", "Greg Creed", "Let me start with the U.S. comps. I mean, they were plus 2%; it was our best quarter in three years. And I agree, it doesn't -- it sort of pales with the KFC two-year conservate and talk about a 10%, but it was our best quarter in three years. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, I'm very encouraged by the start for 2016 for Pizza Hut. And what I'm encouraged about is how rapidly this whole idea of we need to make it easier to get better is going around the world. I know that in the past if I had turned up in Bangkok two months after we came up with an insight of easy beats better, I probably would not have seen that being impacted or reflected in the work either to make us better or make this easier. So I'm encouraged by the start for Pizza Hut in 2016. I have confidence that you will see us deliver sequential improvement in same-store sales this quarter versus the fourth quarter. And every journey has to start somewhere and I think that journey started in the fourth quarter of 2015. And then I am encouraged by how rapidly we are taking this idea and seeing it now being impacted and addressed by all of our teams around the world.", "Pat Grismer", "And then, Karen, as to your question regarding the common POS, the team estimates it will take a couple of years to migrate all of the restaurants in the U.S. to a common platform. So they are targeting end of 2017 to accomplish that. It is a high priority, but given the extent of integration between those different POS systems and back-of-house and other applications, it will take some time in order to do it properly and minimize disruption to our business.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jason West", "Just two separate questions. One, can you breakout in the China comp for the quarter kind of where you are on pricing and then I guess if mix was meaningful there as well? And then separately, Pat, now that we are a little closer to the leverage event, do you have any updates on how you're thinking about use of proceeds? Would you lean more on an accelerated share repurchase or are you also considering a special dividend or more of a gradual buyback? Thanks.", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly. In terms of the China comp for the fourth quarter, the 2% increase reflected a 4% benefit from pricing and then we also had a positive benefit or impact of mix -- sales mix, and then that was offset by some transaction decline in getting to the 2% comp. With respect to our leverage event and use of proceeds, as you know, a lot of it comes down to valuation and where things are at, at the time. So it's early to say exactly how we're going to be returning the cash.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles", "Pat, just a quick housekeeping, if you can give us the puts and takes on China margins this quarter. And then separately, as China food costs continue to be quite favorable, I know there's a little bit of inflation for next year as well as some more resilient pricing. Should we expect you to sacrifice this favorability for traffic in order to more aggressively pursue value in 2016, both China brands, relative to the promotions you ran in 4Q?", "Pat Grismer", "Okay, Andrew. First in terms of the drivers of Q4 margin, we were very pleased with the performance in the quarter. Margins were up versus prior year about 4.5 percentage points, and here's how it breaks down. When you take the 4% pricing, add to it the mix benefit, and strip off the impact of the transaction decline, that's about a net 2 point benefit. On top of that, we had a 3 point benefit from productivity, and another 1 point benefit from closed stores. Offsetting that was a 1.5 margin attributable to inflation. Commodities were flat, but we had 6% inflation on labor. And so that's basically the lock to the 4.5 point gain in margin versus prior year. In terms of how we are thinking about 2016, as I mentioned before, the team is very much focused on building transactions. So while we do expect some modest inflation from a commodity perspective, up about 1% and high single digits for labor, we're not planning to take pricing to entirely offset that. We will look to some ongoing productivity improvements to help mitigate the impact of inflation. But the goal is to at least maintain margin year-over-year at around 16% and to achieve meaningful improvement in transactions.", "Andrew Charles", "So essentially, food costs should be flat then within that construct?", "Pat Grismer", "Andrew, we thought it would be about 1 point of inflation from a commodity standpoint for the year, if you're asking about 2016. Between flat and 1 point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff Farmer", "Just a single follow-up on a handful of earlier questions. So I believe it was at your December Analyst Meeting you noted that Pizza Hut Casual Dining is listed with several of the online aggregators. I think you said the sales mix coming from those channels is something less than 5% mix. I'm just curious: do you expect that sales mix to grow? And then more broadly and more importantly, what's the longer-term strategy with those aggregators as you move forward and they potentially become a little bit more powerful?", "Greg Creed", "Jeff, I think to answer your question, they are still low with the percentage of the sales mix. I think in Q4 I think at KFC, they were about 2% of total sales. I think Pizza Hut Casual Dining was about 2% of total sales. I think Pizza Hut other service was about 30% of total sales, but obviously that's a small part of the pizza business. Yes, we are obviously working with these aggregators and we continue to participate with them. I think -- I would like to say they are now turned, so we don't lose the customer data or erode our brands in that process. So I think that's the critical part of the relationship is that the aggregators like working with big brands like us and we like obviously not -- making sure we keep our customer data and we make sure that we keep our plan positioning really clear in this marketplace.", "Jeff Farmer", "And just one final question in terms of just gauging momentum. I know it's hard to do across multiple concepts, but is this still building or are you getting to sort of a tipping point where maybe it's got about as far as -- gone about as far as it is going to go and then it maybe it sort of settles back down as we get deeper into 2016 or 2017? Or again, really is this still continuing to be a building competitive issue as you move forward?", "Greg Creed", "Do you mean aggregators?", "Jeff Farmer", "Yes.", "Greg Creed", "Yes. Look, I think, as I said, of the four factors that are impacting our business, when I spoke about earlier, I think for Pizza Hut, which were; macros, value, competition, and aggregators. I think they are the fourth. I think they will probably stay the fourth. I think our ability to deliver new value news in the marketplace will be a much greater driver of our improved performance than I see much growth with that. But it will continue to grow. There is no -- I'm not suggesting it won't continue to grow, but I think that because we have strong brands and the aggregators want to work with us as strong brands. I think that puts us in a more driver's seat in terms of how we play with them versus the small guys, who I think the aggregators will have different terms and arrangements with. So I feel good about where we are. I can tell you that the China team is all over it. Micky is very well versed. He's definitely met with the aggregators personally, so we're watching this. It will grow. But I think in that growth and value will be in the short term more important for us to address.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar. Your line is open.", "R.J. Hottovy", "Had a technology question. During the prepared remarks, you said you were pleased with the level of mobile engagement at the Taco Bell brand and the deliveries that may come out of that. I just wonder, if you had any additional color on that and kind of the quantitative measures that we might be able to look at? And then secondly, any kind of takeaways or learnings you can apply to either the rest of the U.S. or even potentially on a global basis from those technology endeavors?", "Pat Grismer", "Yes, I would say that we are very pleased with the progress we're making on the digital front at Taco Bell. You'll recall that we launched our Taco Bell app in the fourth quarter of 2014. To-date, we have about 5 million app downloads. When we look at the behavior of those customers who are ordering through the app, the average check is higher by about 30%. So we're very much encouraged by those early results. We are looking to build awareness of the app to drive utilization. And an important part of that is the introduction of a loyalty component to the app, a game. That was launched in late 2015. It's the first loyalty program of its kind that rewards social behavior and the first reward that was offered for customers who play the game was a free Taco Bell Freeze. So there is a lot of excitement around that. The app is also configured in a way that drives exploration of the menu. So it has helped to create a lot of buzz and a lot of active engagement with our heavy users, very high levels of social sharing of the rewards we've observed and the overall user response has been very positive. So the focus now is having launched the app and more recently, the loyalty program is to drive awareness. And so we do expect to see even greater trial in the coming months. The goal is, you know, for Taco Bell is to strengthen its position as an on-demand brand and so leveraging technology to do that is an important part of the brand's priority going forward.", "Greg Creed", "What I really love about it is the customization that is going on. We recently just got certified by the American Vegetarian Association for Taco Bell. And we can highlight that -- we probably can't run an ad on TV to highlight that, but using the app, we can. And it's really interesting to see that we are actually getting people customized out of beef and into beans as a protein. And from a margin point of view, that's really good for us. But it also makes the customer happy. So what I love is that we can use the mobile app as a vehicle to actually talk a more discreet story about the brand. It's a great story, it's a good story, but it's something we wouldn't traditionally do on mainstream TV. But we can use this to get that message out, and that's making the brand more relevant. And making any brand more relevant is the name of the game.", "A - Steve Schmitt", "Thanks, R.J. Okay two more questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Westra from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Paul Westra", "Two quick ones. One more on China. I was wondering, if you could give us general sales trends update on maybe where you saw some weaknesses or some strength by tiers or geographies or perhaps locations? And then second on Taco Bell. Was wondering, if you could give us a little bit more color on those G&A investments. What were they exactly? Can you confirm that the majority of the year-over-year spike in G&A at Taco Bell was of one-time nature, which you alluded to?", "Pat Grismer", "Certainly, Paul. So first on China same-store sales, similar to recent quarters, performance was stronger in Tier 1 cities at both brands. Our view is that customers in lower tier cities have been more significantly impacted by the softening economy, particularly around the industrial cities, which have been more heavily affected by China's slowing export trade. But that's the only meaningful difference really to call out. And then as it relates to Taco Bell's G&A, as we mentioned, the increase in the fourth quarter was expected and it's fair to characterize a large chunk of the incremental G&A as being nonrecurring. So some components would include performance-driven incentive compensation, because they had an absolute blockbuster year, and so they were paid accordingly. We plan for a 100% payout, so that contributes to a year-over-year decline as we think about 2016. There were some investments that were made and some strategic growth initiatives that would highlight international supply chain development. I would also highlight the digital initiatives, like the ones we just talked about. And so that contributed to a spike in the fourth quarter. And importantly, we think about those as investments to sustain the positive momentum of the brand. I think good businesses that are strong performing businesses reinvest profit upside to sustain the momentum and that's exactly what's happened at Taco Bell.", "Greg Creed", "The way I look at it, look the new plants that you -- trees that you plant and the ones that are growing both need water. You just can't throw water on the new plants. You got to throw water on the big strong trees to make sure they continue to be big, strong, and keep going. And that's what I saw in that investment in the fourth quarter. I'm glad we made it. I'm delighted we made it. It was the right thing to do, and you are going to see that in the performance of Taco Bell going forward.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Joseph Buckley", "Thanks for squeezing me in. Two more questions on Pizza Hut China. First, you mentioned the smaller tier markets being hit harder by the macro. The Pizza Hut expansion numbers the last three or four years have been pretty aggressive, and have you extended the brand into areas where the economic development did not follow or are there cannibalization issues behind Pizza Hut? And then secondly in Pizza Hut, I know you mentioned a 20% reduction in expansion will be across both brands. But within Pizza Hut, how will that break down in financial plans for 2016 between home delivery and casual dining?", "Pat Grismer", "Yes, for -- first of all, I will address your last question first, Joe, and that is that the slowdown in development for the Pizza Hut brand is only for the casual dining business, not for the delivery business. And then as it relates to the performance of Pizza Hut across cities, I would not attribute variable performance to development decisions and higher than expected cannibalization necessarily. It would be more a function of variable levels of macro pressure across these cities.", "Joseph Buckley", "Okay. And Pat just to follow-up then. So the Casual Dining Pizza Hut expansion would be down much more than 20%, with the difference made up by faster home delivery? And what about the sales volume differences there in terms of trying to figure out the growth?", "Pat Grismer", "No Joe, the 20% -- the approximately 20% applies exclusively to the casual dining business. That's not a composite number for both businesses under the Pizza Hut banner.", "Joseph Buckley", "Okay. But it's 20% for both KFC and Pizza Hut or are they both\u2026", "Pat Grismer", "For KFC and for Pizza Hut Casual Dining. We are not slowing down the development of Pizza Hut home service.", "Joseph Buckley", "Okay. Will that accelerate the latter?", "Pat Grismer", "We are expecting it to be at least as much as we developed in 2015.", "Joseph Buckley", "Okay. Okay, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in.", "Greg Creed", "Okay. Well, I think that wraps it up. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. Thank you for taking the time to be with us. And I know I've said this as well, but I do want to thank Pat. Pat joined Yum! at Taco Bell when I was the CMO and he was the Head of Strategic Planning. He has been a true friend. He has been a great resource. He has been a great leader, and I want to thank him. And I want to wish he and his family all the very best for the future. Thanks.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Yum! Brands' First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. Thank you.", "Steve Schmitt, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy, you may begin your conference.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; and Dave Russell, our Interim CFO. Also on today's call is Larry Gathof, Yum!'s Treasurer, and we're very pleased to have Micky Pant, Yum! China CEO on our call as well. Following remarks from Greg and Dave, we'll open the call to questions from the entire team. Please keep in mind, Micky is dialing in from Shanghai, so there could be a slight delay in some of his responses.", "Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.

Investor Event, our second quarter 2016 earnings will be released on Wednesday, July 13.", "Now, before I turn the call over to Greg, I would like to bring your attention to two items you may have noticed in yesterday's release. First is new terminology, we reported core operating profit growth of 21% for the first quarter of 2016. Core operating profit growth is our operating profit growth year-over-year, excluding foreign currency translation and special items. Second, as previously announced, effective January of this year, the company's India business integrated its three brands into our global brand divisions. Prior year figures have been restated in the release.", "Now, it's my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016, with better than expected core operating profit growth of 21% in the first quarter. This includes 42% growth in our China business due to outstanding Chinese New Year results at KFC, underscoring the power of the KFC brand in China when we deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. Company-wide, all four of our divisions posted positive same-store sales and operating profit growth in constant currency. Furthermore, we are on track to finalize the spin-off of our China business by year end, creating two powerful independent, focused growth companies. As you saw in our release, we're raising full year core operating profit growth guidance for Yum! Brands to 12% from 10% previously. Even though it is still early in the year, we are confident about the revised guidance, and will update you as the year progresses. Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then Dave Russell, our Interim CFO, will walk you through the financials.", "So first China. For the China Division, same store sales grew 6%, led by 12% same-store sales growth at KFC. Our KFC business, as a reminder, represents about 75% of our operating profit in China. We saw particular success at KFC during the Chinese New Year with Bucket Meals, which we tailored across four customer groups, ranging from kid's buckets to larger group meals. As a result, buckets mix had a much higher percentage than normally. This lifted average ticket as we focused more on group occasions. And we gained even more consumer insights this year, which will help our business both going forward as well as next New Year.", "Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which represents about 25% of our operating profit in China, remained challenging. System sales declined 1%, and same-store sales declined 12% in the quarter. A tough macro environment and competitive landscape continued to weigh on performance. We're addressing this with urgency, but realize a recovery will take time.", "So wrapping up on China, we're pleased with our first quarter's overall operating profit growth, which came in well ahead of our expectations. The strong margin performance reinforces our confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we generate sales growth, profit flow-through is impressive. As Steve mentioned, Micky Pant, our China Division CEO, is on the call today and will be happy to assist in answering questions you may have on the China business.", "Now, turning to our three global brand divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 1% in the first quarter or 5% on a two-year stack. Operating profit grew 7% in constant currency when adjusting for incremental advertising spend in the U.S. The division opened 79 new international restaurants in 32 countries. 77% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 71% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets. System sales and international developed markets grew 5% and international emerging markets grew 8%.", "I recently visited with the team in Canada and was thrilled to see the assets being upgraded and the marketing position around Always Original. With 6% same-store sales growth in the quarter, I would say it's working. I'm also pleased to see success in emerging markets, which are a key contributor to KFC's growth story. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse, and I'm confident the brand is getting even stronger and will produce strong growth this year and for many years to come.", "Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in the quarter, and was led by 5% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. Our $5 Flavor Menu helped drive system transactions, with company stores leading the way, up 8% in the quarter. Our discipline around making it easier to get a better pizza is holistic and driving traffic. We are focused on the entire customer experience, from ordering, payment and delivery tracking, to our assets and menu. And I believe this quarter's results are further testament to our maniacal emphasis on this way of thinking.", "We are on track to replace over 1,300 U.S. ovens in 2016. For those stores replacing older ovens, this should result in average energy savings of 25% in ongoing operational costs and a faster cook time. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focusing on balancing premium price innovation, such as Stuffed Garlic Knots Pizza to protect and improve unit level economics with compelling value offerings such as our ongoing $6.99 Any Pairs deal. All of this will enable us to provide our customers with a better pizza at great value.", "Our international business at Pizza Hut saw systems sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were especially strong in Latin America and Canada but offset by weaknesses in Korea, Australia, and India. We are committed to offering consistent everyday value to our customers, and will leverage proven value strategies across markets with similar characteristics. We have high expectations for the international Pizza Hut business. Over the last five years, we have opened 1,200 international restaurants, and we will continue to grow this business over time. The bottom line is that we have established solid momentum with our strategy in the U.S., especially around the $5 Flavor Menu. And as we roll this overall strategy out internationally, we hope to achieve similar success.", "Now, turning to Taco Bell, same-store sales grew 1%, lapping 6% growth a year ago, and operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Restaurant margins were an impressive 21%. While 1% same-store sales growth is not what we're used to seeing at Taco Bell, the timing of our key launches had an impact on same-store sales growth for the quarter. The Quesalupa, which launched in February, makes it almost 10% and drove a meaningful lift in transactions. We also launched our $1 breakfast menu in March. The $1 price point is consistent with Taco Bell's reputation as the value leader in QSR.", "Taco Bell's new breakfast $1 Value Menu differentiates itself from the competitors and puts it at the forefront of value in a growing daypart. We now have 10 $1 items on the breakfast menu, and are seeing breakfast sales hold at 8% and transaction growth accelerating. The Taco Bell team is exhibiting great flexibility to read and react to the competitive value pressures, and adjusted their 2016 promotional calendar accordingly to highlight even more value. Insight-driven innovation, cravable food, and breakthrough value such as the upcoming launches of the $1 Beefy Crunch Burrito and steak value later this year, should boost sales and further the brand's momentum.", "So, we're off to a great start at Yum! Over the past several quarters, we have really had three businesses that needed dramatic improvement: KFC China, Pizza Hut China, and Pizza Hut U.S. I'm pleased that we have been able to turn two out of these three businesses, as KFC China and Pizza Hut U.S. are on more solid footing. Now, let's be clear, we're not out of the woods on these businesses, but we've made a lot of progress and will continue to focus on delivering better results. As you heard me say before, this is a transformational year for Yum! as we finalize the spin-off of our China business, creating two powerful, independent focus growth companies. Our brand strength, unwavering focus on the customer, and innovative food offerings driven by consumer insights will allow us to grow Yum! into an even better global company. This is an exciting time and pivotal time for our company, and I look forward to what the future holds.", "And with that, I'll hand the call over to Dave.", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016, and an update on our planned recapitalization and a spin-off of our China business.", "As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results where core operating profit increased 21%. EPS before special items grew 19%, including a five-point negative impact from foreign currency. These results were led by better than expected sales and restaurant margins at KFC China. EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our first quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months.", "I'll now take you through our results by division starting with our China business. For the China Division, overall, same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. KFC grew same-store sales 12%, which was sequentially better than Q4, and exceeded our expectations. A successful Chinese New Year promotion drove results. As Greg said, the KFC brand in China is really powerful when you deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining remain sluggish, declining 12% in the quarter. We are working to turn the Pizza Hut business around in a difficult macro and competitive environment.", "Restaurant margin improved 3.5 percentage points versus the prior year to 22.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC, productivity initiatives, and commodity deflations, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. While our first quarter is a seasonally high sales period for the China Division, restaurant margins of over 22% give us tremendous confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we deliver solid top-line growth, the profits are impressive.", "One other note on China's first quarter results, we had a leap year benefit that added an additional $6 million of operating profit in Q1 to China's results. However, we pulled sales from the leap day out of our same-store sales calculation, so the extra day had no impact on our reported 6% same-store sales growth. The way our reporting calendars work here at Yum!, none of our other divisions saw any impact from leap year in Q1.", "Now, moving to our global KFC Division, which posted its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales and profit growth. Emerging and international developed markets, each grew comps 1%. The U.S. recorded its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth despite overlapping 7% comps in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins improved 30 basis points in constant currency, and core operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental advertising expense associated with the Acceleration Agreement we reached with our franchisees in 2015, core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, the Acceleration Agreement with our U.S. franchisees, which went into effect during the second quarter of last year called for us to invest incremental media of $20 million in 2016 as opposed to $10 million last year.", "Our global Pizza Hut Division delivered 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 5% same-store sales growth on our U.S. business. Same-store sales growth and lower G&A expenses drove core operating profit growth of 9%. This is the best result we've seen on Pizza Hut U.S. in years, and we believe our strategy is working to drive incremental transactions. I am pleased to see momentum behind the business, and believe we can transfer our U.S. learnings to benefit the system globally.", "Digital continues to grow in importance to our sales, comprising 46% of U.S. delivery and carryout sales, a three percentage point increase versus a year ago. On Super Bowl Sunday alone, we took over 500,000 digital orders, representing about 50% of sales on what was an all-time record day for the business. With digital orders comes higher levels of loyalty and higher average spend, so we are investing as you would expect. Along those lines, we are making progress in migrating to a single point of sale system in the U.S. by the end of 2017, which will allow us to be more nimble as we roll out digital initiatives going forward.", "Finally, Taco Bell faced increased value pressure from the burger chains in the first quarter, and posted 1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved throughout the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving 3% same-store sales growth for the year, with a stronger second half than first half. Despite the lower than expected full quarter sales, operating margin improved 150 basis points to 28%, and operating profit grew 4%. Restaurant margins also improved 150 basis points at 21%, and we expect full-year margins to be greater than 20% this year, albeit slightly lower than last year.", "On the development front, we opened 49 new restaurants in the first quarter, with 90% opened by franchisees and licensees. Of our new openings, seven were international units. We expect to open a record number of Taco Bell units internationally in 2016 as we continue to make progress in building out the unit level economics as we enter the new countries.", "I'd now like to shift to our 2016 outlook with our strong first quarter results and a change in China's tax laws whereby a value-added tax, or VAT, is replacing the business tax, we are raising our full year core operating profit growth forecast to 12% from 10% for Yum! For a little bit of background on the VAT, China recently announced further reform to its retail tax structure, which is intended to be a progressive and positive shift to more closely align with the more modern service-based economy. Under this reform, a 6% output VAT would replace the 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be credible to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. This change is effective May 1, 2016, so it in no way had any impact on our first quarter performance. While it's difficult to estimate the impact of this VAT reform prior to its actual implementation, Yum! China currently expects a positive financial benefit, further enabling continued investment in the business, and creating thousands of additional jobs in China.", "While we are raising our forecast for core operating profit growth from Yum! from 10% to 12%, we are maintaining our guidance for China same-store sales of 2% to 3% for the full year. From a modeling standpoint, there are two other things to bear in mind as you build your forecast.", "First, the second quarter in China, which is typically our seasonally low quarter, happens to be our toughest hurdle of the year on a two-year, three-year, and four-year stacked same-store sales basis. Second, we have an RGM convention in the second quarter that we did not have last year that we expect to cost around $7 million. It is important for you to note that these factors were fully factored into our initial guidance and our first half and full year performance is expected to exceed our expectations coming into the year.", "All in for Yum!, we outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, and are raising our full year guidance to 12% core operating profit growth, including the 53rd week. This takes into account the strong first quarter produced by KFC China, weakness at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, and the expected VAT benefit in China, in addition to our brand divisions continuing to produce results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. It is early in the year to raise guidance, but we feel confident given where things stand and we'll update you as the year progresses.", "Now, I'd like to quickly update you on our spin-off plans. We remain on track to complete the spin-off by year end. We plan on filing our initial Form-10 by early May, and conducting comprehensive road shows ahead of the separation. This spin-off will establish two unique investment opportunities, and create one of the largest U.S.-listed China retail businesses. Another key aspect of our strategy is to optimize the capital structure of Yum!. Given the significant improvement we've seen recently in the debt markets, we'd like to announce another milestone in our previously communicated plan of targeting company-wide leverage of approximately 5 times EBITDA. In early May, we plan to enter into a new financing facility of at least $2 million, securitizing Taco Bell U.S. royalties. As the next step in our plan, subsidiaries that operate our KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell's businesses, excluding the Taco Bell subsidiaries included in the securitization financing are expected to enter into a new senior secured credit facility and issue new high-yield notes. More details will be forthcoming in a separate release later today. In line with what we've previously communicated, we plan to complete our rate (19:26) capitalization and have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding by the end of the second quarter.", "Finally, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have bought back 24.7 million shares at an average price of $71, returning a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, excluding dividends. As previously announced, our recap will enable us to complete an additional $4.4 billion return of capital return to shareholders.", "So let me wrap things up. I'm pleased we started 2016 off with a strong quarter. We're confident we'll deliver 12% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business into an independent publicly-traded company. We're working diligently to set up both companies for future success and look forward to updating you on any progress throughout the year.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back to Greg.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Dave. Before we start Q&A, I wanted to provide a brief update on our plans for the China business. You may have seen recent news stories about a sale or a potential strategic investor. I want to assure you that we are fully committed to maximizing the value of our China business for the benefit of our shareholders, and we will carefully consider all options to achieve that goal. As you know, we announced in October that after careful consideration, we believe that the best way to maximize shareholder value is to spin off our China business by the end of this year, and we are making great progress towards the spin-off. We won't have any further comment on this.", "And with that, I'll open the call up to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Gentlemen, your first question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Fundamental question about China for Micky, if I may. Regarding Pizza Hut, what have you done so far, perhaps even through the second quarter to date, with regard to the menu and the marketing? I know you wanted to get back to that five-star dining at three-star prices. Have you done stuff so far? How is that working? And how has your thinking generally evolved about the timetable for a turnaround for the Pizza Hut brand? Thanks.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Thank you, David. I hope you can hear me, because I had a bit of trouble. I'll speak slowly. First, on Pizza Hut, I just wanted to say to all of you that it is an extremely strong brand in China. All our consumer metrics, the brand image tracking that we do regularly shows that brand regard value scores, food scores are very high and they recovered fully from the crisis that we had a couple of years ago. We opened 280 new Pizza Huts last year, and new unit returns are very good. Over the last four years, we have opened 1,000 Pizza Huts dine-in restaurants alone and we dwarf the competition.", "So it is a very strong brand. It is true that same-store sales have been negative, but in 2015, for example, our system sales were up 10 points, and we do track through CREST in 22 cities, and also through publicly reported companies that operate in casual dining here the overall casual dining performance. And it is our understanding that we gained market share. Part of the reason the casual dining sector has been hit has been due to a decline in consumer confidence. And as we explained in December last year, part of it was on account of the fact that home delivery through aggregators was growing. This latter phenomenon has tapered off a bit on account of burnouts, et cetera.", "So we fully expect that Pizza Hut will turn the corner. It is a strong brand. Margin performance has been good. Our sales were minus 1% system sales in the first quarter, but our goal is to get to same-store sales positive. I cannot put a date on it, David, because the market is volatile, but we are doing a number of things. First is that we have shifted the focus back to the core menu with a lot of pizza activity. So we will have more pizza innovation in the next six months than we've had in a long time, and these have tested very well.", "The second, I believe, is our value scores are actually good. You can eat lunch at a Pizza Hut at just a little more than at a KFC. So there's no need for any margin compression, but we do need to communicate that value better, which we have started doing. We have clarified the brand position significantly, and we've hired one of the best celebrities in China to bring that point home.", "And lastly, we continue to emphasize customer service for the programs that will be presented in December. So with that, I feel much better about Pizza Hut than I did a few months ago, but of course, I'm disappointed that same-store sales are still negative. And I might also remind you, as you know very well, that Pizza Hut is about 25% of our sales and our profit. So one way to look at it is that three of the four engines that drive the Yum! China business are KFC. And with KFC performing well, I think we have the ability to sort Pizza Hut in coming quarters.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Micky. Thanks, David. Amy, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. Micky, I'll keep you on the line. On KFC, you talked about the bucket promotion being an essential driver. So how much of the success in the first quarter was related just to that? And I guess related, how if it was very \u2013 if it was a successful promotion, how much of that sustains going forward? If you can talk about sustainability of those sales, maybe since we're well into April here. And can you also just \u2013 commodities were significantly deflationary this quarter. I think they are supposed to be up this year. So are you changing your view on commodities, or was this just the timing of better commodities in the first quarter but not for the year?", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "John, it's Greg.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Yeah, John \u2013 go ahead.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I'll just...no, no, I'm just going to jump in first and then obviously let you provide the detail. Look, first, I want to commend Micky and the entire China team for what I think is a fantastic Q1. KFC China delivered 12% same-store sales growth, and as you can see from the 42% growth in op profit, the earnings power of the business is extraordinary when sales are working in our favor. And we're very encouraged that we have now had three consecutive quarters of same-store sales at KFC China. I think, fortunately, we didn't assume and we don't need heroic numbers like this to continue throughout the year to reach our 2016 guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth. And recent history shows that sales in China have been difficult for us to call.", "So regarding our expectations coming into the year, KFC sales were obviously much better in Q1 than we could've imagined. In Q2, we are closer to where we thought we would be for KFC as we believe that our successful Chinese New Year may have pulled forward some of our early Q2 sales into Q1. That said, six weeks into the quarter, KFC sales are slightly positive, and we're encouraged by where the business is going. And obviously, I'll let Micky speak to that in more detail.", "And as \u2013 we know that we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut in China and quarter-to-date, sales have remained double-digit negative. But again, as Dave mentioned, our Q2 laps at both KFC and Pizza Hut's more difficult, especially when you look at these multi-year stacks. We feel great about the start to the year. We're confidently raising our guidance. We still expect China full year \u2013 China Division same-store sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, which is consistent with our expectations. So with that, I'll just let Micky take over. I just wanted to compliment Micky and the team for a job well done.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Thank you, Greg. I think, John, there were some factors that were unique to Q1 and that is to do with the Chinese New Year. It was the Year of the Monkey, and we were fortunate that the \u2013 actually, it was not just fortune, but the team of KFC has really hit their stride. So Joey Wat, who is a very accomplished retail executive, has now really understood the rhythm of the KFC business. And they put together sort of a one, two, three punch around the Chinese New Year, extending it from the traditional 10 days to about four weeks, centered around a very powerful bucket promotion. But also then with activity afterwards featuring a grilled sandwich, which was good thinking, because after a heavy Chinese New Year, people are looking for a healthier fare. So that aspect is unique to the Chinese New Year, and I think it was a spectacularly successful promotion.", "Somebody asked me how we will ever lap that next year, and I think the one bit of good news we have is next year is actually the Year of the Chicken, so we started work already on the sort of promotion that we will be running. But some of the factors that worked in Q1 actually give me encouragement for KFC overall. The first is the success of selling our core products: fried chicken, hot wings, french fries, egg tarts, and all the familiar favorites in China. And we are extending that principle by doing more activity around buckets in the back half of the year, and also introducing Box Meals, which are a proven international success where you can buy fairly good \u2013 just like a little bit more money, but significantly more product.", "As you can imagine, following a very large success in January and February, we hit almost record volumes in the amount of chicken that we did sell, and also that sale was accompanied by corresponding traffic growth. The ticket impact on our sales of plus 12% in Q1 was about 3%. So it wasn't as though the \u2013 sorry, the pricing impact. It wasn't as though we took pricing to get there. The price impact was only plus 3%. The rest of it was on account of the fact that party sizes for these large buckets were very large, and also there was a significant increase in the number of items bought per person, because the promotion was very well run.", "In Q2, we're about halfway through the quarter. The pleasing thing is that KFC is positive. But as Greg said, there's a lot of volatility around it. It's a difficult quarter because we've got tough laps. We've had some expenses. Our goal as a team here is to make Q2 this year the fourth consecutive quarter of positive KFC same-store sales. But I cannot say that that's a guarantee until we have more visibility. But the fact that the flow-through was very strong in profit terms, the simplification of the menu boards, which was well conducted, the strength of the marketing calendar in the back half gives me and the team a lot more confidence that we had six months ago.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Micky.", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "First, to further what Micky said a little bit, too \u2013 the timing of Chinese New Year, with it being a little bit earlier this year, did provide a slight benefit to Q1 which will be a little bit \u2013 hurts Q2 a little bit. So that was a little bit on the sales line. As far as your commodities question, John, we saw a 2% decline in commodities in China during the first quarter. And we are still on our forecast for plus 1% for the full year.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, John. Amy, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Buckley with Bank of America. Joseph, your line is open.", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thank you. You gave a little bit of this in answer to the last question, but could you talk about traffic versus price versus mix for both KFC China and KFC Pizza Hut during the quarter?", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Yeah, Joe, it's Steve. For the division, we had about \u2013 for the 6% comp for the division, we had nine points of check growth and a three-point decline in transactions overall.", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Presumably, though, positive transactions at KFC?", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "That's the number for the division.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Yes, we had positive transactions at KFC. And as I said that the transaction number as we measured it is the number of tickets we cut in the store. But as I explained, the size of the ticket was bigger on account of shareable meals, principally the bucket. So we estimate that the price impact on our sales was about 3%, and the rest of it was on account of traffic plus a larger check on account of more items being bought. So it was a fairly healthy growth.", "Joseph Terrence Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. And then just switching topics for a moment, Pizza Hut U.S. numbers look pretty good. Pizza Hut international slightly negative. Can you talk a little bit about Pizza Hut international, and what's going on there, and what changes you can implement there?", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, certainly, Joe. I think the good news, as you said, is Pizza Hut U.S. had an excellent quarter, same-store sales up 5%, company transactions were up 8%. I think a combination of the $6.99 Pairs and the $5 Flavor Menu have certainly worked. And obviously, what we're doing now is in the process of taking that success and all the tactics that are associated with that and expanding that rapidly on a global basis. So like all things, this business is very much driven by our U.S. success, and I think what we're doing now is in the process of rolling out that U.S. success and taking it around on a global basis.", "I happened to be in Thailand, actually in January, earlier in the year and you can see already that that team was starting to take the successful tactics that were working and start to see how we can implement those in that country. And that's happening around the world.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Joe. Next question, please, Amy.", "Operator", "Yes. Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you very much. Two unrelated questions, if I may. First one for you, Micky. For a number of years now, labor costs, labor dollars per operating week in China have been a pretty major contributor to margins. As you do plan to re-grow customer traffic, obviously, in the segment and want to stay competitive with wages, are we at the point now where labor starts to inflect the other way, and adding back costs into the system that have been taken out over the last several years?", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Well, it's true that over the last five years labor has inflated in China on account of minimum wage increases by the government. But we've seen a moderation of that. I think the authorities recognize that the economy has to be supported, so I think we're seeing a more reasonable picture there. What we did get in the quarter particularly was some good productivity gains on account of using more part-time and student labor, which is a phenomenon that did not exist in China in the long past, and that is making a difference. So looking forward, it's always a risk, but I don't see labor price inflation as being a significant risk. I think the key for us is going to be product innovation, sensible pricing, and get traffic scores back. So I hope that helps.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you. And then secondly, I thought the commentary on the capital structure was interesting in that part of the new capital structure is going to be a royalty securitization only to Taco Bell, which I don't think your previous debt actually assigned itself to individual brands. So I just wanted to understand the symbolism behind the debt security that's only related to Taco Bell. And could people's imagination start to think that Taco Bell doesn't necessarily remain a part of Yum! over the long-term if an opportunity arises?", "W. Lawrence Gathof - Treasurer & Vice President", "Hi, John, it's Larry Gathof. I'll answer the debt aspect of it anyways. But what we're doing is we're trying to take advantage of the debt markets in total. So we're looking at doing both a securitization, bank and bond debt. So we're putting debt across all the different avenues to again get the best pricing and optimize our balance sheet. The Taco Bell securitization is only going to be on the U.S. Taco Bell franchise and license fees. So it's just that part. The rest of the Taco Bell business will also be part of the other borrowings. So again, the securitization market, quite honestly, isn't deep enough to do any one of our entire businesses. So we just peeled off the piece that we thought was most appropriate for a securitization and are accessing that market. And then again, we'll have the balance of the borrowings across all three brands after that's completed.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, John, to put it bluntly, I wouldn't want anyone to take away any thinking that we're going to be doing anything to Taco Bell, other than love it as a part of the portfolio, love its growth, love its profit contribution, and love that it is a brand that we can take global.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, John. Amy, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Siegner with UBS. Keith, your line is open.", "Keith R. Siegner - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Greg, just a question for you, having come from the Taco Bell brand and having watched that brand be one of the leaders in terms of overall digital engagement, mobile ordering and more, where do you \u2013 how do you feel about the rest of the U.S. portfolio and positioning now? Are you making the progress you want? Is Pizza Hut becoming more of a leader in its categories? Is KFC also coming along? And then what about tests on delivery for other brands like home meal replacement for KFC and even for Taco Bell. Is the rest of the U.S. portfolio catching up to Taco Bell? Where do we stand? Thanks.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Keith, good question, and I would say yes. I think the great thing is we can codify what makes Taco Bell successful; and obviously the other two brands can obviously track with what they've done and obviously attempt to replicate it, but in their own brand voice. So I'm very pleased with the progress that Pizza Hut's making. I think its positioning around making it easier to get a better pizza, I think not only the sales growth but the transaction growth that we just got. Obviously, part of making it easier was to get our value better on Pizza Hut, which we've done. But I think you \u2013 as we also said on the call, we are investing in technology. We do need to get from nine POS systems down to one POS system. But as we also said, 46% of our delivery carryout sales are digital and that's growing. So I do think we're making good progress there.", "On the KFC side, I think the Always Original positioning, the move back to Finger Lickin' Good, the great thing about KFC in the U.S. is it's the brand that's now being talked about. And I think for a long time it wasn't on anyone's radar screen, so I'm very comfortable. I think the launch of Nashville Hot has really helped. Obviously, there is a value game being played by the burger boys because of beef pricing; but I think the return to $5 boxes has been a good move by the KFC team.", "And then for Taco Bell, yes, the answer is I think we're now in 500 stores doing delivery in a couple of the key cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas. I'm not quite sure where else, but \u2013 so that's been expanded. And I think if you just take the overall concept of easy beats better, which I know the Pizza Hut team originated, but what it basically says is yes, we've got to find ways to make it easier for our people, for customers to get to our brands. We do that two ways: we build more units, but we also obviously will start looking at delivery as a way to get our food to customers in their home. So very good question. We're making progress. The other brands, I think, are moving to where the Taco Bell brand strength is. A lot of work to be done, but I think we're moving in the right direction. I'm encouraged by that.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Keith. Amy, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David, your line is open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good morning. My question is on the guidance for the year. And I was wondering if you could provide some additional detail or insight on what you're assuming for China profit growth for the year in that guidance and maybe also the margin that you expect to deliver in that business for the full year.", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "Sure. So, the first thing I'd say is if you're going to have a good quarter at Yum!, you want it to be the first quarter of the year, which is what we certainly did and had a blowout quarter in China. So when we looked at that first quarter, as well as some of the other \u2013 the tailwinds we have in the business with regards to the VAT we talked about earlier, though, it's very difficult to quantify the benefit, we know there's something there, some of the commodity deflation that we're seeing, we felt very confident that even with some of the other headwinds we're facing, particularly Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, of getting to a number that was up 12% for the year. As we said, we have not yet \u2013 we have not adjusted the same-store sales forecast for the balance of year for China. It's just too difficult to call given we're only three and a half months in. But at this point, we feel very comfortable with the 12%.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I mean the way I look at it is to raise guidance in the first quarter demonstrates a degree of confidence we've got in the year. As we said, there will be some puts and calls as the year unfolds, no doubt; but we felt confident in raising it from 10% to 12%.", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "And you asked specifically about the margins in China. Given they are so dependent upon sales, we're still thinking somewhere along \u2013 we're not coming off our guidance from the beginning of the year around 16% at this point.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "And I guess \u2013 if 'm still on, I guess if the margin guidance still is around 16% for the year, I guess I'm a little confused on that, given the over-performance in Q1. Was there something that changed about the outlook for the last three quarters? Or is this some level of conservatism that you're baking in or perhaps...", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "No, I don't think so. I don't think we're thinking about it necessarily in that level of detail. I think we're saying it's just too early. We're off to a great start. With the Q1 success that we had, we feel very good with the 12%. But I don't think you should be reading that into the balance of your forecast.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, David. Amy, next question, please.", "Operator", "Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much. Two things. Just one, I was hoping to get a little bit more color from Micky on the China side. Obviously, with the short-term strength, which seems to be attributed to the New Year's promotion, just wondering how, in your mind, you perhaps separate that from the longer-term recovery efforts? Just it seems like you're confident that the brand, I think, you said has really turned. But then it seems like maybe in March and in April things have really eased. So I'm just wondering how you think about the business over the next 12 months in terms of just short-term spikes because of promotion versus the long-term trajectory improving. And then I had one follow-up on Taco Bell U.S.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Yeah, well, thanks, Jeffrey. Like I said, I think the team and myself are feeling very much more confident. We just this week had all of our store managers, so we had a stadium in the city of Dalian with 8,000 people talking about the theme for the future, which is From Strength to Strength. And in particular, when the KFC section was discussed and we put out plans for the rest of the year and the positioning and the proposed marketing, there was just an unbounded confidence. So I feel that \u2013 I really feel the brand is making a lot of progress. It is much stronger. I think the positioning is very clear. The calendars are strong. We are doing sensible things around the core of the brand. We've already cleaned up the menu boards. We will do that even more. We're introducing proven international winners. I think you always have to be cautious when you come to China, because there is economic volatility, and there is also unexpected twists and turns. So there is nothing hidden; it is not as though we are worried about some specific event or there is something happening that causes us to worry. But you just want to be cautious. We've had two years or three years of a lot of volatility.", "So the way we are looking at it right now is it's a show me, don't tell me sort of story. And we're hoping quarter after quarter to improve and strengthen the business. I think it's been mentioned a number of times Q2 is going to be a difficult quarter on account of a variety of factors. But we are very focused on seeing whether we can deliver positive same-store sales and take it from there.", "So, on KFC I feel confident. I feel that the brand is making a lot of progress. The other thing we didn't talk about today is that we've spent a lot of energy and are going to be taking very good care of store refurbishment. We have good designs, we've got good plans for aggressive refurbs of some of our older stores. We are opening a symbolically important 5,000th store in Shanghai, which is, I think, maybe the best KFC in the world. It's a state-of-the-art green store which will open next week. So I think the brand is making progress on every front.", "On Pizza Hut, like I said before, I am very disappointed at negative same-store sales. And I don't see any reason why we cannot turn it around. There is no intrinsic reason. All our scores are good; our competitive position is fantastic. There really is no international competitor with the name. And in addition to the 1,500 dine-in stores we've got about 300 delivery units which dwarf the competition. So I feel the brands are really genuinely making progress. It's just that it's been two months \u2013 the first quarter was two months. And to make a call on the rest of the year knowing what we've seen over the last three years seems to be out of the bounds of what we should be doing. So that hopefully gives you some context on the way we're looking at it.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "For sure. And then just, Greg, I just wanted to follow up.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "You made a comment about the Taco Bell U.S. It seems like maybe it was a little light of your internal expectation, which I think you attributed to maybe some of the QSR burger competitors taking advantage of favorable beef. So I'm just wondering, just to get a better understanding of your response, does it seem like getting more aggressive presumably on value? I know you've obviously been with the brand for a long time and gone through these phases before. But just the idea that you'd progressively pursue the discounting versus staying the course with your initial plan, just trying to get your thoughts.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, Jeffrey. I think the first thing I want to do is just correct it. Apparently in my prepared remarks I think I said the breakfast mix was 8%; it's actually 6%. The 8% is actually the transaction growth that we got in breakfast in Q1, so I just want to clarify that. By the way, I'm very happy with 8% transaction growth in breakfast with one of our competitors doing All Day Breakfast. So let me just say that.", "So to answer your question, yes, we had tied the launch of the Quesalupa to the Super Bowl. I tried to get the Super Bowl brought forward a couple of weeks because that would have really helped us, but unfortunately the NFL wasn't going to play along. So we were so tied up to the launch with that event that there was a couple of weeks where we were a little naked, I would say. And so obviously, sales and transactions up to there were soft. The good news is that after that event, the Quesalupa has mixed at over 10% and has done well for us.", "But I think even more importantly Brian, who is doing a great job leading the brand, he and the team have already changed the calendar and in fact, today, we will launch some new $1 items into the marketplace. There have been a number of revisions to the calendar. So I think we can still be an incredibly innovative brand, a socially conscious brand, led by digital. But we can also just get our value so it's more than competitive in the marketplace. I think talking to Brian the other day, he and I still have a lot of confidence we'll deliver the at least 3% same-store sales growth for the year at Taco Bell.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Jeff. Amy, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Penney with Hedgeye Risk Management. Howard, your line is open.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help me with the Chinese culture and what the zodiac calendar and chicken means next year in terms of what that asset potentially could do for business. Thanks.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Yeah. I don't think it is a very serious factor, frankly. The Year of the Dragon and the Monkey are particular significance. Every year is important. One interesting feature that Joey and the team put together was they actually introduced a Christmas Bucket in 2015 December which was reasonably successful, so they are dialing that up. So I think the point really is that if you do a good bucket-oriented calendar in December for Christmas and then Chinese New Year next year, we can look to a good performance.", "The success of the Monkey \u2013 the Year of the Monkey promotion has shown to us the importance of choosing the character well, the toys that go with it, the kids meals that accompany it, which will all help us to build for the future. And I think the Year of the Chicken does help. There is no better authority on chicken than KFC. But I don't think it's going to be culturally that significant that people have to eat chicken in the Year of the Chicken or something like that. So it's a help. And all I was saying was that to lap this very successful Year of the Monkey promotion, that's one little gift on our side.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "Okay, and if I could ask...", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Go for it.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "Sorry. Thank you. So, Greg, nine months ago, obviously, the quarter wasn't as strong as you would have hoped. And then we go through the process of you spinning out the China business and talking about the change of the structure of the company and now nine months forward things look a lot better. I was wondering if you could maybe put tangible evidence around an intangible question. And that is, what the changes internally to the employees of Yum! and Yum! China have done to help turn the business around? I don't know if I'm asking that correctly, but I think part of the reason for doing this spin was maybe to focus on the different assets. And this obviously was a fantastic quarter and for all those reasons \u2013 maybe some of those reasons \u2013 I'm struggling to ask the question properly.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's all right.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "But just wondering if some of them \u2013 thank you. Sorry. Go ahead.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Howard, I'll have a go. I think I couldn't be happier to have Micky leading the team. Micky has an enormous amount of just experience, has the confidence of all of us, and did an amazing job running our international business for such a long period of time on all three brands. So I've got a leader in there who I have the utmost confidence in and who has rallied the team in China. We've got great people leading the brands, Joey and Peter. They are just \u2013 they're really \u2013 I think I was there in March looking at the plans, looking at what they've learned from the lessons. Our culture is alive and well in China. So the whole recognition culture and our belief that culture fuels results, I think, was absolutely evident.", "And I think at the same time, what's also happening in the whole business is that we're getting much better at brand building and strengthening our brand positioning. And so I think China \u2013 I would say the words aren't exactly always original; I thinks it's: be your true self. But they pretty much resonate. We've now got this brand on a global positioning so we can leverage things. Micky has reached out and taken things like the $5 boxes that have been incredibly successful in a number of markets. As he said, they will go into the market soon in China. The Pizza Hut team is looking at a new positioning for Pizza Hut. And as Micky said, I think focusing on the pizza and less on the more and getting back to the core will help that brand as well. So I would sum it up as new leader, great leader, fresh perspective, great team, more global alignment, and a real focus on brand building, all underpinned by our fundamental belief that we leverage culture to fuel results.", "Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC", "Thanks.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Howard, thanks. Next question, please, Amy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Company. Brian, your line is open.", "Brian J. Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Thanks a lot. I just want to ask a question on Taco Bell. You did roll out your pretty aggressive $1 breakfast menu in March you said; so it didn't really impact the full first quarter. Can you just talk about how this is impacting the overall business? Is it accretive to your sales trends? Is it doing what you expected it to do? And externally, us looking at the margin, how should we think about how this impacts the food margin going forward or the COGS margin?", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think the good news, as I said, we had 8% transaction growth in the breakfast daypart in the first quarter before we really got a full impact of the $1 menu. So, I think we feel really good that that's going to continue to have an impact on our breakfast business. Our food and paper costs for breakfast are in line for the balance of the business. So whether it grows or grows faster or slower doesn't really impact the overall food and paper costs. The good news is, obviously, Taco Bell is benefiting from the price of beef right now, and that's obviously why you're seeing in the marketplace a lot of value by both the burger chains and why Taco Bell can play an aggressive play in beef as well.", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "I would just add, Brian, that at 6% mix, the breakfast doesn't change the overall Taco Bell story much.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, yeah. I think the good news is it's growing. It's growing in the face of us being focused. We're doing the right thing, which we have got innovative products, we've got value now in that category, in that daypart. And I feel really good. I was out in restaurants in the U.S. just recently, visited Taco Bells for breakfast, got great food, and had a great experience. And I think the general feeling is that this is something we're going to invest in for the long-term.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Brian. Amy, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Andy, your line is open.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Yes, just a quick follow-up on that and then one other quick one. On the Taco Bell margin maintenance in terms of your guidance for the year, even with a more sharpened value focus, is lower commodity cost really the primary reason you feel confident in that still?", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think two things. I do believe we'll deliver at least 3% same-store sales growth for the full year. So obviously, we got off to a slower than expected start. But as we said, we are rolling out the big numbers, plus 6%. But in the discussions I've had with Brian, he still feels very confident. So I think we're confident we will deliver the same-store sales growth that we're (54:15) in the U.S. and obviously commodities are favorable, and I think all signs are that certainly beef will stay favorable probably through the balance of 2016.", "Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC", "And then just quickly on emerging markets at KFC, I know you called out a couple of Pizza Hut markets. That number was only up 1%. Is there any specific country or area that was a little softer this quarter?", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Look, I think that when you're in 120 \u2013 130 countries, I always \u2013 I'm never quite sure how many countries we're in on any one day, I think the good news is we had \u2013 in 130 countries, you're going to have some up markets and some downs. India was minus 1% but Russia was plus 27% in system sales for KFC. We also had strong developed markets. Australia delivered another really good quarter. They were plus 5%, which \u2013 if you think about what they've been rolling over. So we were soft in a number of places, but there is also real signs of real strength both in emerging and developed. And I think that Roger Eaton and the team believe that they also can obviously get sales up into at least the 3% same-store sales growth number for the year.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Andy. Next question, please, Amy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen, your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Thank you for taking the question. So, a question on China that's actually not on comp sales but on new store productivity. It looks like there is still a growing gap between comp growth and average weekly sales growth. And just curious if you could comment on that. Is it being driven by one of the two brands, units in one area or another? And any sort of update on how to be thinking about unit economics per year because I think the last disclosures we have really only go through like 2014. Thanks.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Okay. Karen, what were you quoting as the reason why you had that feeling?", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That if you look at overall store productivity growth, so just sales per unit versus comp growth, it looks like the gap between those two numbers is still getting wider.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "I see. Well, when we look at our performance by peers, it's pretty consistent. So I don't think there's a particular factor there. And I really can't at the moment think of a particular reason. That certainly has not struck me that the new units that we are building are in any way have inferior economics or any such. It's not as though we're building necessarily smaller units. It is true that we built more stores in smaller cities, but our comp sales growth across peers has been fairly consistent. We are experimenting with multiple store formats to take into account the fact that there is still a very rapid build-out in infrastructure in China. So we're expecting \u2013 very large number of malls are already under construction; the high-speed rail network is being expanded. And then in China, unlike the U.S., there is not the phenomenon at the moment of highways with drive-throughs or the rest stops, and all those are being developed.", "I don't really see the character of our productivity per unit changing in the years to come. I think worldwide there is a trend to what we call small box, which is because in-lines are becoming more popular in mall stores, et cetera. So there may be in the longer term a slightly smaller format unit. But China is not that impacted, because we hardly have any drive-throughs here. You hardly have any drive-throughs at all, so most of them are in-lines anyway. So maybe we need to think about this question a little more. But we don't intrinsically see any reason why the sort of growth we've enjoyed should not be projected long-term into the future.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "All right. Thank you.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Karen. Next question, please, Amy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason West with Credit Suisse. Jason, your line is open.", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks, guys. Two questions. One, if \u2013 Micky, I'd love to have your thoughts now that you've been over in China for a while on the idea of franchising certain brands or markets or stores in China. Just your outlook and thoughts there.", "And then secondly, Dave, could you walk through again the math or the reasoning behind the VAT change and how that impacts the business and why you think it would be positive? It would be helpful just to understand that a little bit better. Thanks.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Okay. So, the VAT question I will leave to Dave. I don't know, Dave, whether you want to take that first or...", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "No, go ahead, Micky. I'll go second. Go ahead, Micky.", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Okay. And just remind me, sorry, your first question was?", "Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Just your outlook for franchising in China. Would you like to convert more company stores to franchise, yeah?", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Yeah, right. Sorry. Right, yes. Right. Well, at the moment, as you know, we have stayed at about just over 7,000 stores. About 10% are franchised and 90% are equity. I think at the moment as long as we have \u2013 and the way we never chase a number of stores that we have to build. But when we get new trade zones opening and opportunities that make commercial sense, and there's a very disciplined process for capital allocation and measuring new unit returns, we have a lot of surplus capital, as you know, in China. All the stores here have been built with Chinese-generated capital. There is no intrinsic reason why we would want to give that up to franchisees.", "The two reasons why we do expect, however, franchising to up marginally is, firstly, there are regions of the country where it makes sense for franchisees to operate. We recently opened in the autonomous region of Tibet, our first store in Lhasa, Tibet. And for a variety of reasons, including difficult operating conditions and local market knowledge, that was given to a franchisee. And that's been successful and I think that will grow. So there are parts of the country where we will do it for reasons that it makes sense to do it that way. And the other is that there will be opportunities to do franchising, for example, with gas station chains, et cetera. And for those technical reasons the percentage of franchising might go up from 10% to maybe 15% or something in the foreseeable future, but we don't expect a significant change in there.", "And of course, if we do not find the ability to invest our capital in productive equity investment, sure, we'll look at franchising more actively. We are not \u2013 at the moment, we are agnostic to whether it's franchising or equity, frankly. But both have advantages. Franchisees can \u2013 obviously, they're capital light and also they're very innovative. But at the moment, with the capital that we have, especially as we become independent, I think it will be a good use of the capital to continue to invest. China is a growth market the way we see it, and we still have the vision of doubling or trebling our store base. So that's the way we're looking at it. So I would say the franchising percentage will edge up, but it will not be a game changer in our business.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Micky. Dave?", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "Okay. So, on the VAT, so currently, China is paying 5% of all their sales in the form of a business tax to the government. What's happening now is China is moving to a more traditional VAT regime, which is similar to the regime in many other parts of the world, where we will pay 6% of those top-line sales to the government; but we'll get a credit for some of the inputs that we have into our P&L, commodities, utilities, rent, against that 6% credit. What's difficult for us to say right now is exactly how that those credits are going to accumulate and what exactly is going to be creditable. And we are working through that. As you can imagine, with 6,000 stores this is going to be a monumental effort. And there is also some lack of clarity around the rules at this point, still. So we're going to have a lot more for you in July. We'll have one month worth of this in our Q2 results \u2013 the benefit in our Q2 results and we'll be able to quantify it in much more detail at that point in time.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Jason. Next question, please, Amy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles with Cowen & Company. Andrew, your line is open.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. Micky, as you saw success with an operationally simple promotion at KFC in the first quarter, I realize Pizza Hut is not as time-sensitive of an occasion, but there are opportunities to implement better operational practices of that brand particularly around the breadth of the menu?", "Micky Pant - CEO-Yum! Restaurants China", "Yeah, absolutely, Andrew, there are. I think the menu is complicated. I think I had mentioned this in December as well. It's a tabbed menu. You actually have \u2013 it's a very large number of pages. It's a book. It's a little difficult to navigate, so simplifying that is a priority. Pizza Hut is celebrated and known for the variety of menu here, so we do not want to lose that. But at the same time, I think we can make it far more controlled. It also speeds up service. And table turns are an issue at Pizza Hut at peak times. So for those reasons, we are rationalizing the menu. We are also, like I said earlier, pointing out the great value that we have through lunch combos and other offers. So we are redesigning that part of the menu as well.", "And lastly, I'm constantly amazed at how advanced China is digitally. It's got twice the number of cell phones, smartphones, as the U.S. population. And even in our offices, people go up and down the elevator to go to lunch, they're looking up where the offers are available and where they can book a table, et cetera. So the action is shifting very rapidly to mobile devices, and both the menu as well as digital marketing is becoming very significant. So we're working on that. The good news is that for both our brands we are in a leadership position when it comes to that whole digital interface, cashless payment, et cetera. But to your question, yes, I think the operational simplicity at KFC, making it easier for consumers to choose our best-selling products and the general philosophy that the menu should not be a \u2013 it should be used more as guiding customers to our best-selling products than to give open choices, which they get confused about is something that is applicable at Pizza Hut as well.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Micky. Thanks, Andrew. Amy, we have time for one more question, please.", "Operator", "Gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett, your line is open.", "Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good morning and thank you. Can you guys provide us with a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about the re-franchising efforts in terms of cadence across the divisions? How we should be thinking about it over the next six months to three years out. Thank you.", "David Eric Russell - Interim CFO, Vice President-Finance & Corporate Controller", "Sure. So, the plan is still to be 96% franchised by the end of 2017, which that will include the China units, post-spin. This year, more of what's going to get done are the U.S. re-franchising, which is going to be KFCs and -- I'm sorry, Taco Bells and to a lesser degree Pizza Hut. We would expect significant gains in those regards. Quite frankly, selling some of the international markets is a little bit more difficult, so that will take a little bit more time. We expect that to be more 2017 loaded.", "Steve Schmitt - VP-Investor Relations & Corporate Strategy", "Thanks, Brett.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Brett.", "Greg Creed - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. So, I just want to thank everyone for being on the call. Obviously, we're pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016, that we've raised full-year core operating profit guidance to 12% from 10%. I also want to thank Micky, Larry, and Dave for joining Steve and I on the call today. So thank you all, and look forward to catching up with you in the near future.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. Vice President Investor Relations and Corporate Strategy, Keith Siegner, you may begin your conference.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thanks, Amy. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO and David Gibbs, our President and CFO.

The first will be Taco Bell, May 24 and 25 in Irvine, California. Further details will be provided at a later date.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thank you Keith and good morning, everyone. Given the weather that I see in the Northeast this morning, I am pleased that you could join us today as we share with you a review of our results and discuss the future opportunities for Yum! Brands.", "2016 was truly a landmark year. On October 31, we completed the spinoff of the China business. This marked the largest strategic initiative undertaken by Yum! since our spinoff from Pepsi 20 years ago. I'd like to recognize the work, effort, and diligence across the organization that enabled us to complete the spinoff on time and with such success. The spinoff and concurrent return of $6.2 billion to shareholders in 2016 concluded step one in our transformation.", "We all want to extend a heartfelt congratulations to the Yum! China team on completing their first quarter as an independent public company. Micky, Ted, and the China team did a great job on their call Tuesday evening and we congratulate Joey on her promotion to President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Step two of our transformation centers around executing our multiyear strategy to accelerate growth, reduce volatility and increase capital returns to shareholders. We are taking our franchise ownership to the next level and are on track to increase our franchise mix to at least 98% by the end of 2018. By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million and improve our efficiency by lowering G&A as a percent of system sales to 1.7%. In combination, these efforts will not only enable us to reduce the volatility of our cash flows, but improve absolute cash flow at the same time. I'm really happy to reaffirm the long-term targets we set out at our October investor and analyst conference, and I look forward to sharing highlights with you, as we progress.", "Simultaneously, we're strengthening the foundation underlying each of our businesses, changing our mentality to align with our growth transformation and taking the necessary bold actions to position Yum! Brands for even stronger same-store sales and net new unit growth. These are the building blocks of shareholder value creation for a world-class franchisor. We're championing the customer experience like never before, and putting a fierce emphasis on building brands. The linchpin in all of this, of course, is our focused strategy. I'm a firm believer in the power of focus and believe that we can deliver long-term, sustainable results by honing in on the key drivers of our business.", "Our four growth capabilities define every decision and action we undertake and make no mistake, they are driving our business every single day. We will win consistently by concentrating on being the best in the world with distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent. I am energized to lead such a talented team that is spearheading tangible change across our organization. As we outlined at our October investor conference, we're building a stronger growth machine and are well on our way towards our bold goal of 7% annual system sales growth.", "Now turning to our financial results, across many metrics, Yum! delivered a strong tier 2016. Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% in the year. This exceeded both our October 2016 investor and analyst conference guidance and our long-term target of high single-digit annual growth.", "Now with this in mind, let's review each division's results. First, KFC, whose consistent global performance is impressive. The division grew total system sales 7% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 3% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. In the quarter, same-store sales grew 3% or 6% on a two-year stack and core operating profit grew 15%, including the 53rd week. Total system sales grew 8% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Continental Europe. In international developed markets, total system sales grew 6% with strength in Canada, Australia and Continental Europe.", "I'd like to point out that the U.S. continued its positive momentum, recording its 10th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. The team deserves a lot of credit for delivering remarkable fourth-quarter comps of plus 4% or plus 7% on a two-year stack despite difficult industry backdrop.", "KFC global strategy to return to the fundamentals across the spectrum is paying off. Our strong pride in the core original recipe is at the center of everything we do and this translates to a focus on the basics in terms of recipe, a well-defined brand positioning, globally based on always original and clear value at memorable price points.", "Innovation closest to the core is resonating with the consumer. Just look at Nashville Hot and the recently launched Georgia Gold. We did not change the form of our product, only the flavor profile and our customers love it.", "As we look into 2017 and the future of KFC, I am encouraged by the opportunities we see worldwide. The brand is focused on convenience, making it easier to access KFC anyplace and in any way. For example, we are using flexible footprints, which increase the ease of unit development. With smaller asset types, we can build restaurants in places such as transportation hubs and urban centers. And KFC is also making a big push on the digital front in 2017 with self-ordering kiosks and a mobile site.", "Finally, the brand is expanding delivery around the world. Our product has a very shareable occasion and travels incredibly well, which gives us confidence in the upside of this opportunity. In fact, delivery is the fastest growing channel in the business, and while we offer delivery out of more than 5,000 restaurants today, we plan to expand this even further.", "Now turning to Pizza Hut, which grew total system sales 2% in 2016, including the 53rd week, driven by 2% net new unit growth, but offset by a 1% contraction in the same-store sales. Pizza Hut is a strong global brand, but the U.S. and international are two distinct stories. We're pleased that our international division is laying the groundwork for prolonged growth, and we're particularly invigorated by the team's ability to drive development.", "Net new units grew 6% in 2016 and we expect continued growth as the development agreements signed last year take hold. You have already heard from Yum! China about its plans, but here are a few other examples. In 2016, we signed a substantial development agreement for Central and Eastern Europe. Separately, we signed a master franchise agreement in Australia, where we're excited our new partner opportunistically acquired another pizza chain, shortly thereafter will converge into Pizza Hut over time.", "At the same time, we are implementing our repeatable model to spread best practices around the world. We've developed a strategy where we improve taste, experience and our value proposition all while clarifying our brand message in order to ensure profitable, strong, transaction-driven unit level economics. We are taking our learnings from the success of Thailand where we grew same-store sales at least 20% for three consecutive quarters in 2016 to other markets.", "Korea, for example, has had several months of improvement. Malaysia is in the early days of success and others are implementing it, as we speak. We believe there is a significant opportunity for Pizza Hut International to accelerate top-line and unit growth, and look forward to delivering results consistent with these strategies.", "On the other hand, Pizza Hut U.S., which is roughly 10% of total Yum! operating profit, is clearly in turnaround mode. The quarter's results disappointed and are not acceptable. We have undertaken an extensive study of the business utilizing outside experts and found a number of areas where we need to improve in order to take our fair share of growth in this market. These areas include improvements in the digital experience, delivery times, point-of-sale system simplification, and asset optimization, among others.", "As with all turnarounds, this is a journey we need to undertake hand in hand with our franchise partners and will not be complete in 2017. We will share specifics of the plan in time as we implement them, but let me be clear, we see the market share opportunity in this category. We will execute initiatives across all aspects of the customer experience to capture our fair share and more, and I'm certain we have the ability and the determination to accomplish this. We've confronted challenges in all of our brands in the past and always overcome them. Most recently, we executed a successful turnaround of our U.S. KFC business, so stay tuned as we have more updates while we deliver on our plans.", "And finally, Taco Bell delivered a solid 2016 with system sales growth of 6%, including the 53rd week, driven by net new unit growth of 3%, and same-store sales growth of 2%. Taco Bell continued to outperform the category in the fourth quarter, with same-store sales of 3% or 7% on a two-year stack. The brand's value-driven, innovation-focused model once again proved its merit and I'm pleased with the team's ability to deliver solid results, despite difficult industry conditions.", "In the quarter, Taco Bell saw particular success with the $1 all day messaging and the rolled chicken tacos. As we look to 2017, we're energized by Taco Bell's high/low value strategy and its innovative marketing calendar, including the $1 double stack tacos and the highly-anticipated Naked Chicken Chalupa, which is off to a great start.", "On the international front, Taco Bell continues to build momentum. We opened 53 new restaurants, another record year of development. We saw strong fourth quarter same-store sales performance in Canada, Spain, and the Philippines. The brand launched in Brazil with five new stores in only three months and we're thrilled with the consumer enthusiasm for the Taco Bell in China, which recently opened and is off to a great start. In fact, I'll be visiting this critical market in March and we're already looking for ways to work together with Yum! China to accelerate the growth of Taco Bell going forward.", "In closing, I'm excited about the future of Yum! and the plans we have to unlock shareholder value. KFC and Taco Bell sustained a category defying momentum from December into the new year, which gives me confidence in our 2017 guidance, which David will outline in a few minutes. Every brand is working to improve the key drivers of our business, same-store sales and net new units. We are more focused than ever on collaboration, brand building, and translating this to profitable results for the long term. The path is never linear, but we're relentlessly pursuing our vision of a world with more Yum!.", "Now, before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to take a moment on behalf of everyone at Yum! to express our sympathy for Joe Buckley's family, friends, and colleagues at Bank of America and in the restaurant community. Joe will be sorely missed.", "With that, David, over to you.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thank you Greg and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Greg's sentiments regarding Joe Buckley. Beginning with my days as a division CFO, I got to know many in the analyst community, including Joe. I always admired him and looked forward to our conversations. Not only did he have great industry insights, but he always had a smile and a kind word. All of us at Yum! felt this way and we send our condolences to his friends and family.", "Today, I'll cover four areas in my following remarks. Our multi-year strategic transformation, our 2016 accomplishments and fourth-quarter operating results, our outlook for 2017 and an update on our refranchising and capital return plan.", "I'll start by emphasizing what Greg said at the beginning of his remarks. We're on a journey towards becoming one of a kind, global franchisor with a highly attractive and predictable free cash flow growth profile. By the end of this transformation, we'll own less than 1,000 stores, reduce annual run rate capital expenditures to approximately $100 million, improve our efficiency by lowering G&A to 1.7% of system sales and increase free cash flow conversion to 100%.", "As we shared at our October investor and analyst event, much of the EPS growth through 2019 comes from factors that are in our control; new unit growth, G&A reductions, refranchising efforts, and share buybacks. While our long-term guidance doesn't require our system sales growth to reach 7%, we're laying the groundwork to reach this bold goal with same-store sales and unit growth, only adding to my confidence in our ability to deliver on our long-term guidance.", "Now let's review what Yum! Brands achieved in 2016. First, we completed the spinoff of our China business. We're pleased that Yum! China is set up for success as a powerful, independent growth company, and look forward to maintaining our strong relationships with them as we both work towards our common goals. Second, we completed $6.9 billion of debt financing transactions at very attractive rates. The average rate in our total debt outstanding is approximately 4.75%, with an average maturity of eight years. 90% of our $9.1 billion of total debt outstanding is fixed. We're now managing a capital structure, which is levered in line with our target of five times EBITDA, and which we believe provides an attractive balance between optimized interest rates, duration and flexibility.", "Third, we returned over $6 billion to shareholders, including share repurchases and dividends, slightly ahead of our original plans. We bought back 58.8 million shares prior to spin at an average price of $83 and an additional 9.1 million shares post spin at an average price of $63. And as many of you have seen, we announced our first quarterly dividend as new Yum! with a target payout ratio of roughly 45% to 50% of net income. Last, but not least, we exceeded our new Yum! core operating profit growth guidance of 10%, as provided at our October investor and analyst conference. Core operating profit grew 13%, including the 53rd week, with a strong fourth quarter of profit growth across all our brands. Note all numbers we reference today assume a license fee from China for the entire year and are based on restated 2015 numbers to make the comparisons apples-to-apples. So 2016, really was an exceptional year.", "Now let's take a high-level look at our fourth-quarter performance. We're pleased the Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 27% in the quarter, including the 53rd week. This was led by 27% growth at Taco Bell, 21% growth at Pizza Hut, and 15% growth at KFC. We were also pleased to see KFC and Taco Bell's third quarter outperformance of the category continue into the fourth quarter. As Greg already discussed, Pizza Hut International is gaining momentum and we are in the midst of executing a plan to turnaround the Pizza Hut U.S. business.", "Overall, EPS from continuing operations before special items grew 19%, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from foreign currency changes.", "Now I'd like to discuss our outlook. We're confident in our three-year plans and there's no change to our long-term guidance. Given an encouraging start to 2017 with continued momentum at Taco Bell and KFC, we see 2017 as a year where our underlying base business grows operating profits at a healthy high single-digit rate, entirely consistent with our three-year plan. Underpinning this high single-digit base operating profit growth, we're forecasting 2% to 3% global system-wide same-store sales growth and 3% global net new unit growth with each division increasing their pace of development compared to 2016.", "Combined, we expect global system sales growth of at least 5%, excluding the impact of FX. CapEx is expected to be between $350 million and $400 million. I want to note that given two discrete items, which I'll outline momentarily, our underlying high-single digit base operating profit growth will likely come in closer to mid-single-digits in 2017 on a reported core operating profit basis. As a reminder, core operating profit growth only excludes FX and special items.", "First, the 53rd week lap is an approximate 1.5 percentage point drag on operating profit growth, just like it was a tailwind to our 2016 results. Second, we anticipate a mismatch in timing between lost profits from refranchising and the removal of associated G&A, which we expected heading into our transformation. This mismatch is purely timing-related and we estimate a headwind of approximately 1 to 2 percentage points to operating profit growth this year. This is particularly the case in international markets where the benefit of reduced expenses tied to refranchising can trail the actual sale of the restaurants. The magnitude of impact will vary depending on the pacing and sequencing of refranchising by brand and by market, and we'll update you as the year progresses. Again, this is calendar and timing, not base business results, and entirely consistent with our expectations and the plan we laid out in October.", "Given the potential range of refranchising gains that could occur, we don't believe meaningful GAAP operating profit growth guidance can be provided at this time, as it is difficult to forecast when specific refranchising transactions might occur due to market and other conditions.", "We continue to estimate that by completion of the strategic transformation, the overall impact of refranchising and G&A efficiencies on operating profit will be roughly neutral. And while there will likely be interim noise to operating profit owing to timing factors, operating margins, capital returns to shareholders, and free cash flow conversion all benefit immediately.", "Switching to capital returns, over the next three years, we are committed to returning an additional $6.5 billion to $7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We'll achieve this through a combination of refranchising proceeds, free cash flow generation, and maintaining our five times leverage. All in, we are targeting over $13.5 billion of capital return during our transformation, which spans from the fourth quarter of 2015, where we announced our intention to separate into two companies, through 2019 year-end.", "Now, with regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 98% franchised by the end of 2018. As of the end of 2016, we were 93% franchised. During 2016, we refranchised 427 restaurants, excluding China. In the fourth quarter, specifically, we refranchised 232 stores, including 120 KFCs, 83 Pizza Huts, and 29 Taco Bells. We won't provide interim targets as we work towards reaching our new franchise mix of at least 98%. I remain extremely confident in our ability to deliver on our stated target by 2018 year-end.", "Now, I'd like to talk about our capital structure. As part of our strategic transformation, we increased our leverage to about five times EBITDA last year. Should market conditions and/or government policies potentially change, we'll optimize and refine our positioning to ensure we're making the best decisions for our business and stakeholders. But at this time, we're happy with our capital structure and remain committed to maintaining this leverage profile.", "So to wrap things up, we are pleased with our accomplishments in 2016 and with the progress we've made to date on implementing our strategic transformation. Fourth-quarter operating profit growth was solid and ahead of expectations while the new year has gotten off to a good start for both Taco Bell and KFC. I'm very confident in the strength of our business model, and am certain we're taking the appropriate actions to ensure it optimizes shareholder value. We believe the disciplined decisions we're making today, coupled with the multiple actions taken in 2016, set us up for strength over the near and long term.", "And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.", "Alexander J. Mergard - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, this is Alex on for John. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your fiscal 2019 EPS goal, and given significant FX headwinds and kind of the turnaround at Pizza Hut, is there any ability for you to flex a little bit more on G&A, perhaps below the 1.7% goal?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "As far as the 2019 target for EPS, obviously, there are some FX headwinds to that, that are setting us back, but our interest rate has come in a little bit better than we expected, so there'll be pluses and minuses as we go along the journey. And as far as our pressure on G&A, I'm really pleased that the organization has embraced our effort to get more efficient and we're certainly looking for G&A efficiencies continuously as we go forward on this journey, but at this time, our long-term guidance remains the same.", "Alexander J. Mergard - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David, your line is open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Just a follow-up on your comment on EPS growth first. If we look at your three-year target, and if we go out to that 3.75%, that's a lot of EPS growth relative to the comments you made on 2017. How do you think about 2018 and 2019 just conceptually in terms of growth versus 2017? And about unit growth specifically, you talked about a modest acceleration in 2017 on unit growth. How are you thinking about that and what are you doing to stimulate unit growth further? Thanks.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Obviously, our bold goal, David, is 7% system sales growth and as David outlined, we believe we can get to 2% to 3% same-store sales growth next year and 3% development. I think what's very clear is that we are much more focused on these two. So, as I work with the leaders in the organization, I would say we've raised the awareness on the importance of net new unit growth, not just in the U.S., but outside. In that context, obviously, we had a very strong year at Taco Bell. Obviously, at KFC in the U.S., we've been a net closer. I believe that by the time we get to the end of 2019, we will be a net builder of new units at KFC, so I think that will be a turnaround.", "We have signed significant development agreements with Pizza Hut International with a number of franchisees around the world. These are in the order of magnitude of 200 to 300 restaurants over like five years. And I think that on the KFC front, our ability to continue to penetrate in emerging markets remains. So I feel very good about our ability to continually grow our net new unit growth, and I think there's an equal focus on same-store sales growth, getting back to really understanding consumer insights, really getting to what makes the consumer different, and really understanding that what we're delivering is a food experience, not just food. And I think all of that will help us enormously. And so, I feel confident that I think we probably grew system sales around 4% last year. We are tithing at least 5% this year and I think we're definitely on our way to delivering close to the bold goal of 7% by the end of 2019.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer & Co. Brian, your line is open.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Thanks very much. Kind of piggybacking on these questions around 2019 EPS, when you think about that plan to get there, you mentioned that you don't need 7% system wide sales growth to get there, even though that's one of your goals. So maybe you could talk about what is the system sales growth required given what you know today about all the financial controllables that you have much more certainty about. That's the first question.", "The second question to Greg. I was just wondering if you can take a step back and maybe talk from a high level what you really think the biggest changes taking place within the Company are as you see it as you transform pretty rapidly here from an operating company to more of a franchise company. I mean I think we see all the external, but financial benefits obviously, but maybe you can touch on some of the other points and maybe why that is giving you the confidence in the acceleration in systemwide sales growth.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yes, as far as the components of our journey to the 2019 EPS guidance, as we've said before, we're not going to get into specific details around sales guidance, for example, other than to just say that they're reasonable assumptions consistent with historical and our modest expectations for it going forward. I'll just remind everybody that share repurchases, things that are very much in our control, make up the vast majority of this journey, which is why we have confidence in being able to hit the targets.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yes, and to answer the second question. I think there's really three things, Brian. I think the first one is we are much more focused as an organization. We are absolutely focused on driving same-store sales, net new unit and, obviously, shareholder returns. I think there's four areas that we are more focused in building distinct and relevant brands, obviously, enhancing our franchise capability, this bold asset development and unrivaled culture and talent. And internally, even as we did the 2017 AOP, it was very clear across all the divisions that they are more focused on these four things, which we believe will ultimately lead to stronger system sales growth.", "I think the second thing is, we're running the organizations really through what I call a global leadership team. So, it's not just the Yum! executive team, but we meet monthly as a global leadership team, which is obviously the division CEOs and Presidents. And I think the last meeting, which we had two weeks ago, they remain incredibly confident and optimistic about both 2017, as well as hitting all the three-year transformation plans.", "And then the last one is, we're going to have our first global leadership conference in five years in about a month. This will be bringing the top 200 leaders of the organization together. And essentially, the core of this meeting is about how do we go from good to great? How do we go from growing 5% system sales and get to 7%? And my objective is to use those 200 leaders to essentially be co-authors of this growth because we are going to have to do things differently. We are going to have to be bolder and I want them to co-author that sort of how. I know they are excited about it and I believe that we will leave with everyone having absolutely clear clarity on what we are doing on the focus that we are changing, and I think, hopefully bolder and more courageous decisions that will get us from sort of 4% to 5% system sales growth to the 7% number, which our bold goal.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara, your line is open.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi, Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about Pizza Hut, if I could, because, obviously, I think that's the one where you see the most opportunities to improve. But I guess you said, Pizza Hut is really a tale of two markets, but if I look even across globally, it is the softest business. So, my questions are what are the opportunities here? I mean are there specific markets that you could point to that really set a path and are very strong and where you could share best practices? And if you can't reaccelerate Pizza Hut, can you still deliver against your targets? Is there a strategy to refranchise that to 100%? Can you help sort of quantify the opportunities and challenges for that? Thank you.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Sure, Sara. So let me just say, I think we did deliver 6% net new unit growth in Pizza Hut International last year and I know the team because of the development agreements we've already signed, very, very confident that we continue to grow net new units in the Pizza Hut world. There are some very good examples, as you mentioned, about what we are calling the repeatable model. So in Thailand, we've turned that business around. I think we've delivered at least 18% sales growth for three quarters in a row. We've obviously captured what we've done there, and as I alluded in my remarks, taking that to Korea and Malaysia. I'm excited about the master franchise agreement that we've done in Australia. The results in Australia have improved markedly. I happened to meet with the master franchisee when I was there in December. I'm very impressed and I think that you will see both stronger same-store sales growth, as well as, as I said in my remarks, the opportunistic ability to acquire another pizza company and transform those assets into Pizza Hut.", "So on the international side, I feel very good that we have captured the repeatable model, the things that work, and that we have an accelerating net new unit model in place.", "In the U.S., I think it's very clear. In fact, the way I look at it, I go back to what is the underpinning of why Taco Bell had a pretty successful 10-year run and what is it that helped us turn around the U.S. KFC business? I think it's really two things. It's the partnership and relationship we have with the franchisees and that then leading to an aligned long-term strategy. And so, I think if you \u2013 if I look at Taco Bell, I think our relationship with our franchisees is world-class and that enables us not to be in a week-to-week, month-to-month planning cycle, but to be really looking at the long-term and have great sort of trajection. I think, as I said on the KFC U.S. turnaround, I think Jason Marker, and the team, they changed the relationship with the franchisees, and on the basis of that change in relationship, we've now got a much more long-term sort of strategic alignment.", "On the Pizza Hut side, I think the good news is I know that both the franchisees and us want to replicate the results of both Taco Bell and KFC. I think both sides recognize that we need to improve the relationship and out of that relationship will become hopefully a more long-term aligned strategy. So, while there are many things to do at Pizza Hut, as we have talked about, there's assets, there's technology, there's operating systems, there's communication. I think fundamentally, when we get ourselves into an aligned long-term strategy that executes the plan, we know we've got a plan, then I believe we'll start to see an improvement in Pizza Hut. So I remain positive that we can do this. We know what's got to get done and I do believe our franchise partners at Pizza Hut want to be successful just as much as we do.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "And on the refranchising question, of the 427 units that we sold in 2016, 195 of those were U.S. Pizza Hut. So we have reduced our exposure to the U.S. Pizza Hut business a little bit. And certainly, as we go forward selling stores in Pizza Hut is part of our strategy along with the other brands. But I won't provide any more specifics on the go-forward plan, but we'll update you as we move forward on that.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John, your line is open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning. Greg, I wanted to ask you where you think delivery fits into the strategic priorities of the company right now. It's a global phenomenon across your brands and across other brands. Can you maybe sketch out how you think about it and the prioritization, how you think about it by brand and maybe where you are on a delivery percentage of sales or however you look at it by each brand and if there's countries where you are getting best learnings?", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yes, well, obviously, the Pizza Hut business is a delivery business and I think in the U.S., well, through delivery and carry out, more than 90% of the sales come from that now. So the other thing I'm really excited about is Roger's commitment to take KFC and make it more of a global delivery brand. As I said in the prepared remarks, we are already in 5,000 stores doing delivery. Obviously, we have over 20,000 KFCs. The great thing about KFC is it is perfectly set up to be delivered. There is nothing better than a bucket of Original Recipe chicken in terms of a transportation vehicle, product that holds its heat, delivers well. So, in that sense, I do believe, and I know Roger believes that accelerating delivery is a key part of it.", "And on Taco Bell, obviously, Brian has started to roll out Taco Bell delivery. This product isn't as well set up to be delivered as the other two brands. But what is interesting is that when people want this product, they'll have it delivered. I think we're already in about 400 stores in the U.S. It's not a huge part of the business at the moment for Taco Bell. I know that Brian and the team are committed to accelerating that. Where we do have delivery, particularly around college towns, it can actually be, I think, about 4% or 5% of sales, but still a long way to go.", "So, to answer your question, we're focused on it. We really have to turn Pizza Hut into a delivery brand. We're still probably well known as a dine-in brand, but the delivery brand is what we've got to change the consumer's perception. KFC, we're committed to growing delivery and we have a great product to deliver. And on Taco Bell, our customers want it; we're just going to work at how we get it to them. So, the answer is we're very focused on that, and that will be one of the drivers of growth.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "The only thing I would add is that Taco Bell is actually in over 900 stores with delivery now. And when you think about the Pizza Hut business, one of the challenges we have in the U.S. is more than half the stores are \u2013 have dining rooms attached to them and aren't really ideally set up for delivery. So that is \u2013 part of the journey at Pizza Hut is getting into more delivery-friendly assets over time.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And David, if I could just quickly follow up on G&A. I know there's going to be timing issues around refranchising in international, but you must have used the G&A number in your guidance for 2017 in the high-single digit or mid-single digit excluding these things. Can you give us some sense of where you think you are at the end of the year in G&A for 2017?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Here's what I'll say on the G&A front. If you look at what we've released in 2016, it looks like G&A went up about $60 million. But the reality is, if you back out special, it went down about $50 million. And that's before the effect of inflation. So, we had \u2013 we made some considerable progress on G&A in 2016.", "In 2017, we've got a different mix of refranchising and G&A cuts that collectively is going to provide this 1 to 2 point headwind. But we're certainly on track with the plans that we had to get to the 2019 targets, and we're going to make meaningful progress on G&A in 2017, similar to the progress that we made in 2016.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Francfort from Bank of America. Gregory, your line is open.", "Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys. Just one quick clarification. On tax rate, I think the last update you guys had given was like a 26%, 27% tax rate for the new structure, but we are a little bit below that. Is that still the right number as we look out over the next couple years, or should we think about maybe a lower number?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "No, we believe that's the right number. Obviously, there's uncertainty on that as we're seeing potential changes in policy, but that is our current guidance.", "Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then just thinking about technology for the three brands, can you give an update on where you stand around common POS, digital ordering, potentially loyalty? Just sort of an update on the technology front for the different brands.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Well, on Pizza Hut, hopefully by the end of the year we'll be at a single POS system in the U.S., which will help enormously. Internationally, we're looking at getting out of multiple POS systems down maybe one or two, so that will help dramatically. Taco Bell is almost at a single POS and back-of-house system, which obviously sets them up for eCommerce, digital, social. And KFC is obviously also making progress to get to a more aligned one system. That will help us do things like loyalty, which obviously are critical and important in the marketplace. It sets us up to obviously drive the social agenda, and I think all of that will lead to improved growth to the business going forward.", "Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Is that more of a end of 2017 and then we start thinking about some of these initiatives kicking in in 2018 around loyalty and digital ordering as you think about sort of the outlook on timing?", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I mean I think, well, obviously, Pizza Hut's got a very big digital ordering business today, but I think the opportunity for us to do loyalty and things like that will obviously happen once we get to this single POS system. Taco Bell already has mobile apps you can obviously order through. I think that business isn't large yet, but what it does do is actually make the brand a relevant brand. So, it's one of those things where we may not be getting a lot of business from -eCommerce on Taco Bell, it does actually reinforce that this is a millennial-centric brand. And then on KFC, yes, I think it's not going to happen any time soon, but we definitely know we need to be in the loyalty business. And so, whether it's late this year, next year, that's probably more the timing that things will occur.", "Gregory Paul Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Jeffrey, your line is open.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great, thank you very much. I had one question and then one just reporting clarification. From a question standpoint, following up on the G&A discussion from earlier with the plans to reduce kind of to that 1.7% system sales, just wondering, as we think about the operating margins, kind of below that line, we've seen hundreds of basis points jump at each brand. Whether or not the brand is challenged or not, we've seen big jumps, which is obviously driven by the refranchising, but I am just wondering in terms of your insights, long-term goal by brand maybe, or maybe just at what point we reach a certain level where you say, you know what, it's hard to see that operating margin expand much beyond that. Just trying to see the pacing and sequencing of what appear to be very big jumps in the operating margin for each brand.", "And then just from a reporting standpoint, just to make sure that we're all on the same page, I mean it looks like for the fourth quarter of 2016, you adjusted to reflect the pro forma, assuming Yum! China was a franchise model for the period, but we should do the same presumably for the prior three quarters of 2016? I mean I think you had an 8-K out there that gave the 3Q 2016 year-to-date, but just want to make sure I didn't miss anything in terms of the first three quarters separately, so quarter one, two, and three by segment restated as if China was a franchisee for the full year. Thanks.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Okay, Jeff, this is Keith. First, on the margin question, good question. And, yes, this is all consistent with the plan. Post the October investor and analyst event, we put a slide up that actually showed pro forma for the whole transformation to at least 98%. What our restaurant level and EBITDA margins and EBIT margins would look like on a baseline of 2015. So, if you look at that, you can actually see pretty explicitly where we think those margins can get to within a vacuum.", "On the other front, yes, as I said in my introductory comments, we're going to get you pro forma results for the new fiscal year and for China, and we're shooting for early April. So, that will be full quarterly just like \u2013 look, I've been in your shoes and I know what you're looking for and what will be most useful. It is coming. We're shooting for early April.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I get it. I was under the impression from the press release that the adjustment you were giving by early April was just the realignment of the months versus kind of the periods you were using. I just want to make sure we are also talking about quarterly 2016, the first three quarters individually in terms of each quarter restated with China as a franchisee with the royalty payment coming in by segment.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. So, that's early April?", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Restated for everything.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "So at this point, we should be taking the year-to-date we have for the third quarter and doing our best to just kind of cut it up to come up with the first three quarters of 2016 and applying it by segment?", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tarantino with Baird. David, your line is open.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, good morning. My question is on the comps outlook for this year, 2% to 3% globally. That would be better than what you've been running in recent years, and in recent quarters. So just wondering what your degree of confidence in that outlook is as you sit here today and whether it requires some improvement at Pizza Hut or if you're assuming improvement in the other divisions.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thanks, David. It obviously is ahead of our run rate. As I think I said earlier, the organization is much more focused on two things, driving same-store sales and delivering net new units. So, I think just the amount of time we're spending on what do we need to do in order to deliver that growth, as we alluded to, obviously, both KFC and Taco Bell, took that sort of Q4 momentum into Q1. We've got the launch of Georgia Gold, you've got the launch of Naked Chicken Chalupa, and obviously, we've still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut. So, with the plans that we put together for the AOP, I feel really good about the plans across the brands, internationally, and in the U.S. It's nice to go into the quarter with some momentum. And I think this focus is really starting to pay off. And I'll be even more excited when we come out of the global management meeting and I've got the top 200 leaders to really help us think about what else could we do from a bold and courageous point of view in order to deliver even more same-store sales growth and even more net new unit growth. I'm really looking forward to that meeting because there's nothing better than being asked to co-author your own future.", "So, I feel good about that. I feel good about the plans that the divisions presented in 2017, and now we've got to go and execute, which is what we've traditionally been very good at.", "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "And Greg, thank you for that comment. Just to be clear, does the guidance this year or reaching the guidance this year require better performance out of Pizza Hut?", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Well, I think, look, our performance will differ, obviously, across the three brands. So, in averaging 2% to 3%, I have expectations that maybe one brand will do better and one will do a little less and one will do about that number. So, I'm not expecting every brand to deliver that. I think the brands that have got momentum, we can build on that. And the brand that doesn't have momentum, we've got to do a lot of work. I sat down with the Pizza Hut U.S. team yesterday. We were reviewing calendar changes for this year, which obviously, they're working with the franchise community. So, no one is sort of sitting still either. If we are having success, we're trying to build on it. If we're not having success, we are acting quickly in order to change the trend.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Carla, your line is open.", "Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. I'm wondering if you could just give us the baseline number for the restricted group EBITDA. I know the financials you typically put on the website, but they're not up yet.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Carla, we don't have that number with us right now. Give me a call afterwards and we can discuss.", "Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And then one other question. Have you seen any impact on sales internationally as when we see news from Trump that's more domestic-focused or I guess that's causing any rift with international countries?", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I think the easiest answer is no. I'm not seeing any impact anywhere. There's obviously a lot of discussion and speculation, but I'm not seeing any impact on our business in any country so far.", "Carla M. Casella - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Hargreaves with Stifel. David, your line is open.", "David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Yes, just to echo that last comment, if you guys could put restricted group EBITDA in the press release going forward since bondholders don't really \u2013 we've got a subordinated claim on Taco Bell performance. It would help a lot. It's hard to back into. Looking at the deltas in the cash from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, it was a big change and we will back into it in time, but I was just wondering if you could go over the major changes. It looks like you went from about $2.9 billion to $700 million. Could you talk about the big pieces there and then your comfort level with that cash balance? Thanks.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "David, this is Keith. On November 3, we filed an 8-K showing a pro forma end of 3Q balance sheet and cash flow statement for Yum! excluding China. What you'll see is a lot of the cash you just referenced in the $2.99 billion related to China. So, we show you actually what it was, excluding China, as of the end of 3Q. Then, if you do the walk from that number to what we show at the end of 4Q, largely that is one quarter of dividend and the share repurchases that were accomplished through the quarter, as we outlined in our press release. Give me a call afterwards and we can clarify, but that should be all the pieces you need to get through the walk.", "David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "But the $700 million is pretty much what you'd expect to have going forward, more or less?", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "That's what we have now. Long term, in terms of cash needs, it's a little different now, given the moving pieces related to refranchising. We still have some company-operated stores. We do not need $700 million, as of now, and we'd like to knock that down over time. Historically, we've been in the $600 million to $700 million range, including China. So, it's less than that now. We'll update you as we get closer to run rate at the end of the transformation, but definitely less than the $700 million we have now.", "David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Lastly, your 6.25% notes go current in March, so I'm just wondering if you're comfortable having those on the balance sheet till maturity or if you might deal with them proactively?", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "As we said, we're monitoring all market and macro conditions constantly, trying to make the best decision and get to the optimal mix of interest rate, duration and flexibility. As we said, we're comfortable with this \u2013 with our capital structure right now. If anything changes, we'll communicate that in due course.", "David Richard Hargreaves - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Gentlemen, your last question comes from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. John, your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you, guys, so much for taking me at the end. Thanks and for the third question for JPMorgan. The question is on Pizza Hut. In your press release, 47% of Pizza Hut sales are in the U.S. David, you made a really interesting comment that half of the units in the U.S. are dine-in assets and not really set up for delivery. So you kind of have a big chunky part of your business that's not really optimized for where the consumer is and probably where the consumer is going either. So can we talk about how to isolate that red roof asset, that dine-in asset that really does kind of complicate and make the difficulty of turning around the Pizza Hut brand very different than other platforms that exist that are delivery and carry out only?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Well, the good news, John, is that our Delco model, our small box model, is a really good economic model. The cash paybacks from building Delcos is three to four years, on average. So, we have a way to get out of those red-roof restaurants that are holding us back. And by the way, not all of them are sub-optimized for delivery. Some of them were built more recently. Some of our dine-in stores aren't even red-roofs; they were built with a newer model. So there's a mix of assets there. But we do have an economic way to get into a better asset and, Artie Starrs, the President of the Pizza Hut U.S. business is working with the franchisees on a plan to make that happen. And unlike a lot of transformations where you can introduce a new product overnight and it's a quick fix, this one takes a little bit of time.", "We also have a fast-casual model, which we've talked about at previous investor meetings, which really plays into the current trend in the pizza category. We are seeing a lot of growth in fast casual. We've had a lot of success with that, albeit with a small number of units. And the franchisees and the Pizza Hut management team are excited about it and using that as another option to get into an asset that's better positioned for delivery, but also can add incremental sales through lunch day parts in this fast-casual model.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "A couple of years ago, gosh, maybe it was five years ago, maybe more, you kind of drove a pretty significant contraction of KFC in the U.S. and at the back end of that contraction, you contributed some capital to KFC franchisees as well. I think it was related to ovens and maybe some other things. Do you think the Pizza Hut brand is kind of in that position where you make it a better brand, a smaller brand and perhaps you actually do step up and contribute either some OpEx or CapEx to the U.S. franchisee?", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I think right now we are, obviously, having a lot of discussions with the U.S. franchisees, which Artie is leading. And I think until there's an outcome, I think, as I said earlier, I think the great thing is that the U.S. Pizza Hut franchisees, as much as we do, want to obviously turn the performance around and be more like KFC and Taco Bell in the U.S. They understand that it's going to require a partnership. They understand it's going to require long-term strategic alignment. And I think how that plays out in terms of what both sides do in order to build that relationship and get ourselves strategically aligned, that is sort of, I guess, work in progress. But I am very confident that both sides want to obviously get to a better place and get this brand back into growth.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. Thanks again, guys.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Greg Creed for closing remarks.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "So, thanks, everybody, for being on the call. I guess for me 2016 was a landmark year. We successfully spun off Yum! China, we launched this multi-year transformation plan, and we returned $6.2 billion to shareholders. I'm very pleased with the results and a solid end to what, I think, was an extraordinary year. Core operating profit increased 27% in the quarter and 13% for the year, obviously exceeding our guidance. I remain very confident in our three-year plan. So, there's no change to our long-term guidance and I'm encouraged by the early progress we're doing to unlock growth through this sort of focused four growth drivers. We're off to a running start. I think we can accelerate growth, reduce volatility, and increase capital return to shareholders. So, I guess in summary, I'm very excited about the future of Yum! And I think we represent an extremely compelling growth story and one that investors, I hope, will buy into.", "So, thanks for being on the call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are Greg Creed, our CEO; and David Gibbs, our President and CFO.

The remainder of our 2017 key earnings dates are available on our website.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased our momentum continued through yet another quarter, driven by our continued focus on our four key growth drivers. For the second quarter Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 19% and EPS excluding Special Items of $0.68, representing 21% growth over prior year. System sales grew 6% comprised of 2% same-store sales growth and 3% net new unit development. The underlying base rate of growth in our business both in terms of sales trends and profit contribution continues to track in line with our plans and longer term goals. As such, we are maintaining our 2017 full-year guidance.", "Before I review our key growth drivers, I want to note that our core operating profit growth for the second quarter in our KFC Division benefited from several items outside of our normal run rate, which David will discuss in more detail next.", "Now to our four key growth drivers, which are at the forefront of every decision at Yum! I will talk to you about unrivaled culture and talent and our distinctive relevant brand. Then David will discuss unmatched franchise operating capability and bold restaurant development.", "First, unrivaled culture and talent, Yum!'s greatest asset for driving results. This year, I'm continuing my commitment to championing our culture and talent not only with our own employees but also throughout the franchise system. I strongly believe that leading and investing in our culture is the best way to fuel better business result and I'm excited to see our franchisees embracing these ideas and learning to grow our iconic brand. I can tell you that our people and our franchisees are energized, our transformation agenda is taking hold, and our culture is stronger than ever.", "Next, let's talk about how this culture is fueling results in our three distinctive relevant brands, starting with KFC, which is truly a global powerhouse. The brand continues to be Yum!'s most consistent, largest and fastest growing concept with a presence across 129 countries, providing the scale and diversification for a powerful business model. Representing approximately 50% of Yum!'s operating profit, KFC has nearly 21,000 units across the globe. During the second quarter, system sales grew 7% with same-store sales growth of 3% and net new development of 4%.", "We are proud to highlight that in 18 of our 20 KFC business units across both emerging and developed countries, KFC reported positive same-store system sales this quarter. In the U.S. the second quarter represented KFC's 12th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at a healthy 2%, or 4% on a two-year stack. The $5 Individual Fill Up and $20 Family Fill Up are at price points that resonate with the consumers and leverage the core menu of finger lickin' good chicken and sides.", "The team has truly embraced the idea of moving from food as fuel to food as an experience. Just look at the Colonel drive-thru robot, the online retail store and the proof that KFC is literally out of this world. Who else has sent a sandwich into space?", "As further proof KFC is back atop the cultural conversation, the online retail store, KFC Ltd., was mentioned in media spanning from the Huffington Post to Golf Digest. At the end of launch day, 18 of 29 products had sold out. The standout item was a $20,000 400-year-old meteorite in the shape of a Zinger chicken sandwich, selling within 24 hours with several other interested buyers as the sale was pending. These are truly remarkable events and something no one would have believed possible three years ago.", "Our KFC international markets, representing nearly 90% of KFC's profits, also performed well, in particular, our Turkey and Australia markets. In fact, our Australia market delivered 7% same-store sales growth, driven by the launch of frozen beverages and a strong value, such as the $2.50 chips and gravy and 24 nuggets for $10.", "Our Turkey market delivered same-store sales growth of 23%, driven by balancing the promotional mix between high-end bucket promotions and low-end offerings along with LTOs, which attracted new customers and grew transaction. The market is also seeing growth in their delivery business, which grew nearly 35% over the prior year and now represents approximately 30% of sales. Delivery remains a key growth driver for KFC with $1 billion of sales for the brand as of today and the opportunity to significantly increase this, as additional units and markets begin to offer delivery.", "Our largest franchisee, Yum China, acquired a majority stake in an online aggregator platform complementing their already robust delivery business and is an example of one of our markets with a longstanding history of delivery. In addition, we have new markets testing with both online aggregators and in-house delivery all over the world. In fact, across the entire Yum! system nearly 20,000 of our restaurants offer delivery which is almost half of our total restaurant. Delivery offers consumers a new occasion at typically higher check averages and by leveraging the power of Yum! to create repeatable models amongst the markets, this makes delivery a platform with huge growth potential.", "Next, to Pizza Hut, which as we have discussed is a tale of two businesses. First, the U.S. business, which represents approximately 10% of Yum!'s operating profit signed the Transformation Agreement in May, demonstrating unity amongst the system and our commitment to a digital delivery centric model. As a reminder, in return for additional media spend and funding from Yum!'s, the franchisees have committed to honor all-advertised national price points through 2019 and to permanently increase their ongoing contribution to national advertising and digital fees. An additional benefit of the increased advertising is that the funds will be used towards national advertising, allowing the brand to increase its share of voice as it works to build awareness of its efforts around digital and delivery.", "The brand remains on track to effectively be on one point-of-sale system by the end of the year which will allow Pizza Hut to drive efficiency in its ability to improve its operations around delivery and speed-to-market on digital implementation.", "As an example, this week, Pizza Hut announced the launch of their first ever U.S. loyalty program, Hut Rewards. This program is the only national pizza loyalty program that rewards online guests with points for every dollar spent on food. And as further proof that the brand is working to elevate their delivery-centric strategy, they recently announced the hiring of 14,000 drivers by year-end 2017. While we do not expect the Transformation Agreement to yield results overnight, we do expect to see improvement over time. In summary, I'm confident these bold steps will pay big dividends for the Pizza Hut brand over the long-term.", "Internationally, Pizza Hut system sales increased 7% with 1% same-store sales growth and 5% net new development. We recently met with 10 of our top global Pizza Hut franchise organizations at our Partner's Council to gain delivery and digital-centric alignment to accelerate growth for the business. This group of influential individuals represents some of our largest international markets and over one-third of our total net new units currently committed under development agreements over the next three years. I am encouraged by the excitement these growth-minded leaders have for Pizza Hut, carrying an enthusiasm for the brand we haven't seen in a long time.", "In addition to this, our UK business recently rolled out Pizza Hut Digital Ventures, an in-house model for digital technology that allows for consumer-led and fast-paced decisions. Through continued testing and real-time iterating, Pizza Hut Digital Ventures is transforming the Pizza Hut UK website into an easier, faster and better experience for our customers. Thanks to this agile capability and the improved site functionality, we are seeing increased conversion rates, which drive digital sales growth.", "Finally, the repeatable model for value and taste we have previously discussed is lapping its successful rollout and the sales turnaround we saw in key countries like Malaysia and Korea continued in Q2. All in, the international team is hard at work and we are excited about these results and the long-term growth prospects for Pizza Hut.", "Finally, Taco Bell, which represents approximately 30% of Yum!'s operating profit, posted another strong quarter of same-store sales growth coming in at 4% with 1% of that coming from transaction growth. We remain confident in delivering another strong year of results by committing to the strategy, encompassing value and innovation with Mexican-inspired product such as the $1.49 Loaded Taco Burrito you saw this quarter. As I alluded to during the prior quarter, we introduced an additional Naked product with the Naked Chicken Chips, a creative twist allowing us to expand on our chicken platform.", "I know the Taco Bell team enjoyed meeting everyone and highlighting their growth story at the Analyst Day in May and I hope you appreciated hearing their story and got a good taste of their world-class products and innovation. As further evidence that Taco Bell continues to be a distinctive and relevant brand, news from Taco Bell saying, \"I do,\" to weddings at the Las Vegas store appeared in top tier national food and lifestyle outlets. Since the initial wedding announcement in February, coverage of this campaign has created 1.7 billion impressions for the brand. Our customers now have a new and unique way to show their love for each other and this iconic brand.", "Additionally, last week, Taco Bell announced a partnership with Lyft to launch Taco Mode. For the first time, Lyft has created an integration within their app that enables consumers to ride through a Taco Bell on the way to their final destination. The ride is designed to be as much an experience as the end benefit of capping a night with Taco Bell cravings. This partnership highlights the forward thinking at Taco Bell to provide access to our customers in new ways enabled by technology. Weddings and Taco Mode are just a few examples of the cultivation of the brand into consumers' lifestyles.", "Internationally, we also continue to accelerate our presence of Taco Bell. During the quarter, Taco Bell opened 15 international units in 7 countries. In particular, in our four key growth markets of Brazil, India, China and Canada, the team opened 6 units bringing our total unit count in those countries to 54. We are very excited to have opened our first standalone unit in Canada in nearly 20 years. This restaurant is hugely popular on social media with 98% positive sentiment and plans to start serving beer soon.", "In India, the team has defined a category of one positioning by offering a differentiated customer experience through elevated assets, table service and unique product offerings like hard shakes that have unlocked opportunities for accelerated expansion of this brand in this huge potential market.", "In summary, aligning Yum! by brands several years ago highlighted the potential for Taco Bell internationally. And as you can see, the team is working diligently to bring the cult of Taco Bell to everyone across the globe.", "In conclusion, Yum!'s three distinctive relevant brands delivered another successful quarter. We are on track to further unlock the potential of Yum! through our bold transformation initiatives and look forward to updating you on our journey.", "And now, it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and CFO, David Gibbs.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will discuss our second quarter results and full year outlook. I'll then provide an update on our transformation initiative and two of our key growth drivers: bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. I'll close with more detail on recent capital markets transaction.", "Yum! delivered another successful quarter with 19% core operating profit growth and 21% EPS growth excluding Special Items, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. As Greg mentioned, our core operating profit growth for the second quarter included the benefit of approximately $9 million within our KFC Division as a result of several items outside of our normal run rate. Some of these items include higher renewal and transfer fees as well as lower closure and impairment fees. We do not expect these items to recur in the future.", "As we expected, there will be noise on a quarterly basis as we continue to execute our transformation. This is why we continue to believe the best way to evaluate Yum! is to focus on 2019, our first clean year post-transformation and our target for $3.75 or more in EPS in 2019.", "I am pleased we remain on track with this target as well as our other aspects of our transformation strategy including our goals of at least 98% franchise ownership, reducing G&A to 1.7% of system sales and achieving run rate CapEx of $100 million in 2019. We are confident this transformation will allow Yum! Brands to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient, ultimately delivering more growth to you, our shareholders.", "With respect to our guidance, the first half of the year saw a limited impact from net re-franchising dilution. However, for the full year, we now anticipate the net impact from re-franchising dilution to be towards the high end of the 1 percentage point to 2 percentage point range we previously discussed. Combined with the lap of 2016's 53rd week, these two items are the drivers of the difference between our underlying base operating profit growth trend of high-single digits and 2017 guidance of mid-single digit core operating profit growth. As Greg said, the underlying base rate of growth in our business both in terms of sales trends and profit contribution are tracking in line with our plans and longer-term goals.", "As such, we remain on track to deliver at least 5% system sales growth this year versus our 2016 system sales growth of 4% excluding the 53rd-week impact. The 2017 system sales growth guidance includes 2 percentage points to 3 percentage points of same-store sales growth and approximately 3% net new unit development.", "Specific to the fourth quarter, we would note that in aggregate, we anticipate the net impact of refranchising dilution and the impact from lapping the 53rd week to be approximately a 10 percentage point to 12 percentage point headwind before any underlying core operating profit growth.", "Regarding the Pizza Hut U.S. Transformation Agreement this quarter, Yum! incurred $12 million of costs primarily related to digital investments which were recorded as a Special Item. As a reminder, $37.5 million of incremental media spend related to the Transformation Agreement will be reflected in our core operating profit. $25 million of this will be expensed in the third and fourth quarters this year and has already been incorporated into our full-year guidance. The remaining $12.5 million is expected to be expensed in 2018.", "Next, our transformation initiatives, including reduced G&A, refranchising, capital returns, and increased leverage are all on target for completion. G&A excluding Special Items as a percent of system sales was 2.0% this quarter. And we remain comfortable with our target of 1.7% by 2019.", "With regards to refranchising, during the quarter we sold 244 units, including 40 KFCs, 163 Pizza Huts, and 41 Taco Bells, finishing the quarter at 94% franchised on our way to becoming at least 98% franchised by year-end 2018 with the majority of the refranchising expected to be completed in 2017.", "Gross refranchising proceeds totaled $136 million this quarter and $320 million year-to-date. As part of our refranchising commitment, we continue to expect $2 billion in post-tax proceeds.", "As I mentioned on our last call, we continue to aggressively leverage our renewed focus on bold restaurant development by attaching development agreements to our refranchising deals. This will enable us to elevate Yum!'s historical new unit development run rate to one that will help us achieve our goal of 7% system sales growth over the long term.", "To highlight our bold restaurant development, we opened 487 gross new units and 174 net new units this quarter for net new unit growth of 3%. I'm especially proud of our Taco Bell Brazil market, where they opened 15 Taco Bells in nine months. Demonstrating the flexibility of the asset types, one of the Brazil units is 38 square meters or about 400 square feet and is on track to generate average annual unit volume over $1 million.", "Entering new markets presents its own challenges. However, the Brazil market has embraced this challenge with success by thinking creatively about solutions to supply chain and unit economic obstacle. Frankly, this may be the most successful early entrance of a new brand into a new market that I've seen during my career here at Yum!, reflective of our new mindset to unlock growth.", "As another example of bold restaurant development, our KFC U.S. business continues to update their assets to the American Showman design imaged through their remodels and new restaurants. The remodel is affordable with an average sales increase of mid to high-single digits. And both the design and results to-date have been well received by our franchisees, customers and teams. To-date, KFC U.S. has over 500 American Showman restaurants, representing over 10% of their assets. And we are excited about the potential overall market impact.", "Unmatched franchise operating capability has always been of utmost importance. And I'm excited to see the progress we are making. For example, at Taco Bell an operational speed initiative improved drive-thru wait times by 10 seconds in the quarter. In addition, Pizza Hut UAE made significant improvement in their online overall satisfaction scores, which are now approximately 25 percentage points higher than the 2016 scores. This is driven by speed initiatives, promised time improvements and a restaurant engagement strategy focused on bettering the underperforming restaurant.", "We discussed Pizza Hut Korea on our last earnings call. And I'm pleased the market is continuing to see improvements in their overall satisfaction scores, driven by improving speed and taste scores.", "At the Pizza Hut Partners Council that Greg and I attended, one of the partners in attendance was our new franchisee in Japan, who is working with his management team and employees to implement growth strategies, improve the value of Pizza Hut and bring capital and a commitment to growing the brand.", "Additionally, we met the new Taco Bell franchisee in Brazil this quarter, who has opened the 15 restaurants in nine months, which I previously mentioned. This franchisee is an example of how to develop the brand in the right way, investing in people and world-class assets to bring the cult of Taco Bell to an entirely new population.", "In total, Taco Bell added 12 new franchisees over the last 12 months. Six of these are domestic with the brand strength in the U.S. allowing us to be highly selective when adding new franchisees, ensuring they have extensive operations experience, a deep understanding of their markets and the desire for meaningful development.", "We are also pleased to continue returning capital to our shareholders, including repurchasing 5.6 million shares this quarter at an average price of $68 for a total of $384 million. We also paid a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for $105 million, bringing our total capital return to $489 million this quarter and over $1 billion year-to-date. As a reminder, we plan to return between $6.5 billion and $7 billion from 2017 to 2019.", "I'm also excited to share some good news regarding the financial markets' continued support of our business transformation and capital market strategy. First, in June we re-priced our term loan A and revolving credit facility, reducing the interest rate by 75 basis points to adjusted LIBOR of plus 1.5% and extending the maturity to 2022. This will reduce our annual cash interest by approximately $6 million with approximately a $1 million benefit in 2017, net of fees and other expenses.", "Second, consistent with our stated intention to maintain a targeted leverage ratio of about 5 times and in anticipation of a $325 million bond maturity due in March 2018, we executed a $750 million 10-year bond offering with a coupon rate of 4.75%. The deal was multiple times oversubscribed and was one of the lowest rates in high yield in any sector in the last four years. Our total debt outstanding is now $9.8 billion. Our current average interest rate is now 4.5%, and the average maturity is seven years. Additionally, approximately 90% of our total debt is at fixed rate.", "In conclusion, we have built upon our first quarter results with a successful second quarter. We are pleased to be on track with our 2017 guidance and our Strategic Transformation Initiative. Our four key growth drivers: distinctive relevant brands, unmatched franchise operating capability, bold restaurant development and unrivaled culture and talent allow us to be more focused, more franchised and more efficient. In the end, this will deliver strong, steady growth and we look forward to updating you along the way.", "And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Your line is open.", "Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much. Lots of exciting developments at Pizza Hut, clearly, lots of good color there. But as far as key priorities go, maybe you could just talk a little bit more about the technology, the operations, and the asset pieces, what you kind of see as the easiest to address, where the biggest opportunities lie. And then just building on that, on the asset piece specifically, any additional color you can provide on the Pizza Hut Delco units? I think it's probably about 20 that you've got open at this point only. But anything more on the economics, the feedback, et cetera? Thank you.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Well, I'll start with the piece on the assets. I think you're referring to the Fast Casual Delco model that we've been rolling out over the last few years... with pretty good success.", "Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "The good news is that we have offered an incentive for our franchisees to accelerate the Fast Casual Delco model and we've seen a number of franchisees sign up. In fact, we were hit with 100 submissions to participate in expanding the test. So I think the Fast Casual Delco initiative is off to a good start. That's not just an initiative, by the way, that we're doing in the United States, that is also a big part of our international growth strategy.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yeah. We actually shared that with the International Partners Council when we were with them in London probably three weeks ago, and I think there was true excitement about Fast Casual Delco as a global opportunity for Pizza Hut.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yeah. And then on the other items that you asked about, Dennis, like technology, assets, operations, obviously all very critical, all part of the overall Transformation Agreement with the U.S. franchisees. As one piece of evidence of the progress we're making on technology, you heard Greg reference the loyalty program that we just launched. You can expect to see those kinds of improvements to our technology platforms coming out but obviously we are not going to share much in advance of revealing them to the consumers.", "And then on the operations front, I know the team \u2013 you've also seen our messaging start to reference hot and fresh, and the way that we're going to make sure that our consumers get the absolute best product. We know we have the best product in the category when we deliver it hot and fresh. We're doubling down and making sure that we have the capability with drivers and equipment to make that happen on a consistent basis.", "Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, Dave.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Glass from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. My first question just has to do with your system sales goal of 7%. You got close to or closer to it this quarter. And if you look at just the sum of comps and units, it's actually 5%, maybe that's rounding. But is there a new store productivity story here either in the new stores you're opening by brand around the world or market mixes that may actually help you get to the system sales goal even if the sum total of the two growth numbers that we add up typically don't add up to 7%?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "It's a good question, John. I wouldn't read too much into it. For example, the same-store sales growth for the quarter of 2% was a very strong 2%. So there is some rounding that's happening there and a little bit of mix issues, a little bit of timing of when new units open. So when you put it all together, yes, it rounded up, and we like that but there's a number of different miscellaneous factors that contributed to it.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I think there's also, as we have been \u2013 David and I've been around, and I've been in Brazil, UK, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong in the last quarter. I think it's a couple of things. One is the small box concept is definitely taking \u2013 getting traction, and that small box is allowing us to penetrate places like in Africa, into places we would not have been able to traditionally penetrate with our existing sort of asset base. And then, I think, Cantina \u2013 I was up in Chicago the other day, one of our franchisees in Chicago. He has one opened in Wicker Park and he showed me where he's going to open another four or five. There's no trade-off with any of our existing Taco Bell stuff. So I think the whole opportunity for us to get into small box Cantinas, urbanizes the brand will help us drive net new units.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Could I just follow up with a question on Pizza Hut loyalty program? What is \u2013 do you have loyalty anywhere else in the world? Is there a model you're following or is this the first one? And are there models out there that do transaction driving loyalty and others that do ticket driving loyalty? What kind of program is this? Does it require the app to use? Or can anyone use it? How widespread do you think the use is and how do you think it impacts sales ticket versus transactions, for example?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Just on the prevalence of programs in our system, yes, we do have loyalty programs and we have some in parts of Asia that are executed quite well and a big part of driving the business. So we've certainly gone to school on our \u2013 within our own system on leveraging learnings. We actually engaged an outside party also to help us understand the loyalty landscape. In a lot of cases, being the last to the party on loyalty in the pizza category is a good thing because we get to offer the best program and learn from the experiences of others.", "John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC", "Good morning. I have a question on the franchise revenue versus the franchise expense. As we would expect, as you sell off the restaurants, your franchise revenue is going up. But when we exclude the Pizza Hut transformation expense, it looks like the franchise expenses are actually dropping. Was that $9 million favorability reference in KFC in that line item there or are you just finding more favorability in franchise expense in addition to the ongoing G&A reductions?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I think that there's mostly some timing issues that would contribute to that. The $9 million that \u2013 we called out the $9 million on the KFC line just because KFC had a very strong quarter this year and I wanted to make sure everybody understood that a small portion of it was more one-time related to U.S. fees that we collected earlier than normal that contributed to an outsized quarter when it came to U.S. fee \u2013 U.S. KFC franchisee fee income. That was close to $6 million. But I wouldn't read too much into the second part of your question.", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. And on the CapEx for the year, you're running well below the $300 million to $350 million that you had discussed earlier in the year and you're obviously doing more refranchising in the back half. Is this kind of the run rate we should expect for the rest of the year? Do you have a, I guess, corporate capital plan that will require you to have a step up in CapEx in the back half?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I don't think we're going to \u2013 we're not revising our guidance on CapEx spending. Obviously, we're laser-focused on getting the overall rate down to $100 million by 2019. In terms of how the spending is going this year, it's sort of in line with the targeted number. Maybe there's a little upside there, but I wouldn't read too much into that either.", "Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Greg. As part of the 7% system-wide sales growth longer term, there's meant to be a step up in unit development, which I think is 4% to 5% longer term. So could you put the current 3% into the context of that 4% to 5%? Do you see a step up by brand in 2018 or 2019 in terms of new units? Or, I guess, just as important for other size? Or do you think we're going to see a particular slowing in... (33:27 \u2013 33:31)", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Sorry, your questions \u2013 you're breaking up. We cannot get the question.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yeah. I don't know if we lost him or not, but John, just to address the point you made on unit development, we haven't released any specific targets for unit development. So you referenced 4% to 5%. Certainly, we'd like to get to levels like that but we've been focused on the overall mission of getting to 7% in system sales growth over the long term. A big part of that will be increasing our development because we know when we plant that development pipeline over the long term we can count on it to deliver that growth every single year. Yeah, so and you should be looking for us to continue to be ramping up development in the years to come, but we haven't released any future guidance on that.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And my apologies for the transcript. I think I just assumed 2% to 3% comp and the rest from unit development. But can I ask if the connection is better right now? Do you see step-ups in 2018 or 2019 either in terms of new unit openings or in closures? And if you could just give us a little more color or confidence that even if we think about 2018, you could get better net results than 2017?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yeah. I think one of the features of the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement is actually a limitation on the U.S. stores, making it harder to close stores in the U.S. So we should get a benefit from that in 2018 if you're thinking about broader issues that may be working in our favor.", "But beyond that, I think we've said this on many calls, we got our management team together in the spring. The mission in this company has been to hammer home this focus on development. Bold restaurant development is one of our four key growth drivers. And I think we've seen a mindset shift all around the country, all around the world, that is really contributing to much more focus on development than we've ever had. Greg mentioned different formats. There's just a lot of good stuff going on in development. Now it takes time to plant a development pipeline and get it to grow, but we do expect to see an increase in development in 2018.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yeah. I mean, if you think about it, we've been closing KFC U.S. stores for a number of years, for quite a number of years. Hopefully, with the now 12th consecutive quarter of performance at KFC, there will be some change there as well.", "I think, as David said, the development agreements sort of go with refranchising. So as the refranchising occurs, the development agreements kick in. And then obviously these new units, small box new formats Cantinas, the 38-square-meter we saw in Brazil, I think all of these provide us opportunities to penetrate and continue to grow our net new unit.", "John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. I've got one more on the Pizza Hut Transformation Agreement in the U.S. Can you guys provide at least some base level numbers for where the concept is right now in terms of things like delivery as a percent of sales mix or digital orders as a percent of sales mix? Just give us some context as to where you're beginning this journey. And it will make it easier for us to track the progress moving forward.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "We won't provide very specific numbers. But our digital mix is around 50%. Even though we have more than half of our stores in the U.S., our dine-in stores, our business is very heavily reliant on carryout and delivery. I don't know. Maybe 10% to 15% of sales are dine-in, and the rest of the sales, just in broad terms, are split between carryout and delivery.", "Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. Just to follow up on John's question on unit development, maybe just a qualitative answer on this would be helpful. You mentioned Brazil, you mentioned the stabilization of Pizza Hut U.S., but if you were to think about your global business and looking at your pipelines of franchisees and licensees, where do you anticipate the biggest wins from a development standpoint as you look out one and two years? And then also on delivery, globally you mentioned that that's going to be an important sales layer. I know you've talked about that in the past. How significant can that be? And when do you see wins from that accelerating? Thanks.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Well, I think there's obvious markets like China where we'll continue to see a lot of new unit growth. I think as we said, Taco Bell focusing on four big markets, China, India, Brazil, and Canada. As we said, we've opened our first freestanding drive-thru in Canada, the second one is under construction. In that one market, we think we can open six or seven. We've got U.S. franchisees for Taco Bell now sort of doing development in Canada. They're now doing development in Korea.", "So I think that where we've seen growth, which will be Asia, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, we've got a lot of these locked into long-term development agreements.", "As David and I said, we were with the Pizza Hut franchisees last week. Have a new franchisee for Pizza Hut in Japan. Very impressed that he has got a real growth mindset, and I think we can accelerate opportunities in Japan as well. So I see it on that side.", "On delivery, as we said in the prepared remarks, about 20,000 restaurants currently deliver. Obviously mostly Pizza Huts, but a large number of KFCs and obviously Taco Bells as well. I do think that delivery is going to grow. We like the benefits of delivery, higher check, incrementality, new users, new occasions. And I think what we're doing right now is testing in a number of places just user aggregators, doing it ourselves.", "But I think we all see really a lot of potential growth there. Encouraged by some of the tests that are going on, like a UK test for KFC, where we're actually doing a test with both aggregators and by ourselves. We're seeing good incrementality, good check growth. So I think even the KFC team believes that adding another $1 billion in sales in the next few years is not without its possibility.", "And then, Taco Bell, obviously, where we are doing delivery with DoorDash, I think it's now in a 1000 restaurants and it can get bigger as well. So I think our brands are well established with 20,000 restaurants doing it. We have the expertise of Pizza Hut to help us. I think brands like KFC are ideally set up to be delivered with large buckets, $5 boxes, $10 chicken shares and $20 buckets. It's almost like the Colonel 60 years ago realized one day we'd be delivering this stuff.", "So I think we're in a really good place to take advantage of it. We do think there's growth there for us, and to some extent we're actually \u2013 KFC China is hosting a delivery summit this month where everyone from around the world will be going to a delivery summit in China so we can learn best practice from them, but also share best practice that we are doing from around the world. So we are all in on delivery.", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "And one other point on development, which I think Greg alluded to earlier but just to expand on. The KFC U.S. business for many years was a net closure of stores, north of 100 closures every year. The KFC U.S. team, given the strength in the underlying business now feels really confident that they can get themselves to be a net opener of stores and that could get to north of 100 openings per year. So you think about a 200-unit swing alone just in KFC U.S., that'll obviously take time to implement. That obviously would be one of the contributors to the increase in development.", "David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right, thanks.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. I have just a couple of follow-up questions, if I may. The first is on again Pizza Hut, and I think, Greg, you said it wouldn't be kind of an immediate turnaround. Results won't show up overnight. But I think in the past we've seen that Pizza Hut can do things to drive sales in the short term in a pretty meaningful way, in particular around value messaging. So maybe you could just share a little bit about what you're doing in 3Q in terms of marketing and price points.", "And a related question is what are you seeing in the demand environment in the U.S. and the competitive environment? I think we've heard a lot about heavy discounting by hamburger restaurants in particular. I was wondering if you're seeing that have an impact on any of your brands, KFC and Taco Bell still comping well, but maybe a little slower sequentially.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Well, I don't want to get into Q3 in the pizza category, given the competitive nature of it. I think what I can say is we've said it's a slow build. The incremental media didn't happen in the first half, it will happen in the second half. Obviously, we've just rolled out loyalty. So I think you will hopefully see a slow build, and we see the results obviously paying off in 2018 and beyond on Pizza Hut. From a demand environment point of view, I think the great thing about our category is or the great thing about food is you've got to eat it and I think there will be winners and losers.", "I think the people that have the most distinct and relevant brands, the people that do the best job of executing operations, the people that open new units and the people who are driven by culture and talent and that's why they're the four things we are focused on because we believe by focusing on those four things we can be successful in both the U.S. and on the global scale. So that's, I think, sort of the way I see the market at the moment.", "Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "So, no increased intensity around discounting or value?", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "No. I think, I mean, value is always going to be important. So I don't see any renewed focus. I mean, if you think about it, the question is \u2013 I think we've got very good everyday value. At KFC, we have $5, $10, and $20, and that really does resonate. I think $7.99 at Pizza Hut, I think the $1 and the $5 boxes at Taco Bell. So what I like about the way we're set up is that we've got everyday great value. What we don't have to do is to get into this deep discounting and sort of cutting the price on core products which you never want to get into because one day you got to raise those prices.", "So I really like the way the three brands have constructed their value equation in the marketplace. I think you see that it's working on the whole. And what I appreciate is the franchisees' commitments to staying on those price points so that our customers know day in and day out they can always get not just the best tasting food but the best value in the marketplace.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thank you. Next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Karen Holthouse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Hi. You're seeing more Pizza Hut questions. Sort of going back to the initial reacceleration in comps in Taco Bell that has been really built for many years. That was kind of kicked off with the Doritos Locos pretty singularly iconic viral product. Do you think there's a similar opportunity at Pizza Hut to really kickstart things with the product or are you more focused on sort of fundamental building blocks around technology, digital, asset base, et cetera? Thanks.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I think the answer to that it's like the answer is and. We've got to make it easier and better. We do believe we have the better pizza; we've got to continue to make sure that we deliver a better pizza in the marketplace. But better is also making sure that our piping hot pizza gets delivered to you on time and therefore obviously tastes better.", "So I think the answer is, just like everything in life, we have to be easy and we have to be better. So we're working on the easy components whether that's all the technology, the digital play whether that's loyalty, and at the same time, we're obviously continuing to work on making sure we have the best pizza in the marketplace. And I think a combination of both of those will see us sort of build the Pizza Hut brand back into the brand we want it to be.", "Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk about the 2019 target of at least $3.75 in EPS. I think the $3.75 is an attractive target on its own but the question I have is what's the key in your internal model to unlocking that wording of \"at least\" within that stated target? Is the achievement of your goal to get to 7% systemwide sales growth help you unlock that word \"at least\"? Or is there something else that we should be focusing on?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "No. I mean, as we've said in past calls, we built the model on reasonable assumptions. We don't have to be heroes to get to that number. So the kinds of things that would contribute to outperformance would be an acceleration of system sales growth, a turnaround in the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We're not counting on any of those things to get there. So the \"at least\" is only there to indicate that we certainly have room to go beyond that if we see an acceleration in development, system sales growth beyond historical rates, Pizza Hut U.S. getting back to growth.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And just the follow-up question I have is on Taco Bell. It's a great comp for the quarter relative to the industry or any metric, really. The question I have is what were the biggest differences that you saw in the business and the growth of the business this quarter when analyzing the sales versus the 8% comp you achieved last quarter?", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "I mean, the way I look at Taco Bell is, we are just really enthusiastic about the long-term fundamentals of the business, whether it's the consumer metrics, the ops metrics, the financial metrics. Obviously, the brand has delivered consistent, healthy same-store sales growth over the long-term. And I think the icing on the cake, Dave and I happened to spend two days with the FRANMAC group, which is the franchise leadership group for Taco Bell in June, and I think to say they were happy with where the brand is, happy with where the brand is going and happy with the Taco Bell leadership team would be an understatement. So I just feel good about where the brand is going. What happens then quarter by quarter, I think, you will see us continue to deliver. The long-term fundamentals for this business are in great shape.", "Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "All right. Thanks, guys.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Operator, we'll take one more question, please?", "Operator", "Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Charles from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you. Going back to your Investor Day, you guys set out plans to refranchise about 2,000 stores for at least $2 billion in proceeds. So it's about $1 million per store. Obviously with the 244 franchises in 2Q, you've looked at a gain on the sale, but the implied proceeds per store of $560,000 were a little lighter than the implied targets. Is the way to think about this is that it was driven, the lower proceeds per store, driven by an outsized amount of Pizza Huts that were franchised during the quarter?", "David W. Gibbs - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Yes, absolutely. Pizza Huts obviously, with smaller investments in the smaller box units typically garner less proceeds, lower volumes versus, for example, our Taco Bells, which is our highest volume concept that we are selling stores of any scale on. So very much you will see that number move around from quarter to quarter, depending on the mix of the units.", "Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thanks.", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Okay. Go ahead.", "Keith R. Siegner - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Thank you. (49:22)", "Greg Creed - Yum! Brands, Inc.", "Okay. So thank you all for being on the call. As we said, we believe we had another successful quarter, 6% system growth, 21% EPS growth, 19% core operating profit growth, and we look forward to updating you as we work the brands as we go through the rest of the year.

", "Lastly disclosures pertaining to our outstanding debt in our Restricted Group capital structure will be provided at the time of the fourth quarter Form 10-K filing. ", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Creed.", "Greg Creed", "Thank you, Keith good morning everyone. The fourth quarter was a solid earning to the first full year of our transformation journey. For the full year, Yum! delivered 5% system sales growth, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. This is comprised of 2% same store sales growth and 3% net new unit growth. We've reached a significant milestone in 2017 as we closed the year with over 45,000 global restaurants in our 139 countries and territories. We are excited about the long-term growth potential of Yum! brands and are on track with our strategic transformation initiatives. ", "Today, I will talk you about two of our four growth capabilities. Distinctive relevant and easy brands and unrivaled culture and talent. Then David will follow up with this second too. While at the restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability, he will also discuss our 2017 results, 2018 guidance and progress towards our transformation initiatives. ", "I'll begin with our distinctive relevant and easy brands. There is no better way to make a brand easy than having it deliver right to your door. And I'm very excited to announce a new U.S. partnership with Grubhub. As the nation's leading online and mobile food ordering company, Grubhub offers delivery in over 1300 U.S. cities. This partnership will rapidly expand KFC and Taco Bell's ability to offer the online ordering by pickup and delivery to our customers in all existing U.S. Grubhub markets with many more to come. Making it easy to access all of our brands is important and the partnership with Grubhub is a key component of making our brands distinctive, relevant and easy. ", "Now on to the brands. Starting with KFC, where system sales grew 6% excluding the 53rd week, with 3% same store sales growth and 4% net new unit growth in the fourth quarter. Internationally, we had several standout markets and I'd like to highlight two, Russia and Brazil. In our Russia market, system sales grew 26% in the quarter with 9% same store sales growth and 18% net new unit growth. The market strong growth has been supported by their marketing focus on value and core. Unit development is also strong with 2017 being the fourth year in a row that the Russia market opened at least 1000 new stores. This success is driven by the utilization of technology-based development strategies, controlled growth through development agreements and new access formats. ", "In Brazil, same store sales increased 21% for the quarter and 18% for the year, with significant media coverage, value offerings and an operational focus on win on types objectives the market delivered strong results. Brazil also focused on reducing costs and enhancing the supply chain distribution to ensure value products are financially feasible. ", "Now to the US where we saw increased pressure from competitors on chicken innovation and value in the fourth quarter, with same store sales declining 1% but still finishing the year with our fourth consecutive year of same store sales and traffic growth. While disappointed in our results for the quarter, we are bullish on 2018 with marketing trends around both value and innovation. ", "We started the year with our valued coronel [ph] and now have our first female coronel [indiscernible] showcasing innovation with our new smoking mountain barbeque flavor. This builds off the other familiar flavor that you\u2019ve already seen such as National Hot and Georgia Gold and gives an exciting and operationally easy way to bring new flavors to existing products. ", "Additionally, we continue remodeling our asset base with plans to remodel another 600 stores in 2018 resulting in nearly 40% of the asset base being at current image by year end. We are excited about our plan for 2018 and confident that this will be our fifth consecutive year of positive signs for sales growth. ", "Next the Pizza Hut, in the US, same stores sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter demonstrating the strength of our Longlines systems through the transformation agreement and building momentum in the business. Pizza Hut remains committed to ensuring every customer has a hot, fast and reliable experience. The hot experience begins with 145,000 new thermal pouches which deliver your pizza 15\u2070 hotter. The fast experience is enhanced through the 14,000 delivery drivers hired in 2017. ", "The delivery times are improving and we remain committed to being the employer of choice for delivery drivers. In addition, there are now over 24,000 new car toppers on the road. But the reliable experience is enhanced with key digital features implemented during the fourth quarter through our mobile and online platforms which significantly enhance the user experience. ", "We are encouraged by initial trends in the hot rewards royalty programs launched in August and are confident our investment in loyalty will pay off in the long run. There is another example of Pizza innovation, we recently announced a partnership with Toyota to bring Pizza Hut to your doors with the driverless vehicle, showcasing innovation and forward thinking at both companies.", "We are excited about the future for Pizza Hut US and confident our investment in hot, fast and reliable experience will drive positive results. ", "Internationally, we are pleased with the 6% net new unit growth during 2017, opening nearly 500 net new restaurants in the year with strong growth in Asia including Indonesia and India. ", "Fast casual Pizza is one of the fastest growing segments and we continue to align our delivery centric asset strategy to meet this global trend. The repeatable model for value continues to show success in several of our international markets including Korea, China and the Philippines and we continue to make great strides with our digital and technology ventures to make it easier to get a better pizza in our international markets. ", "Finally, at Taco Bells, system sales grew 3% excluding the 53rd week with 2% same stores sales growth and 4% net new unit growth in the quarter. A key differentiator for Taco Bell is the ability to innovate and elevate. In the quarter, we showcased the abundant indulgence of our $1 value menu we launched the Blueminatti ad campaign to strategically elevate Taco Bell as a not so secret society where anyone with a buck can unlock 20 satisfying and innovative menu items. ", "And to highlight our unique ability to drive buzz around new products, we originally launched a movie trailer Web of Fries to introduce you to our new nacho products which were added to the $1 value menu. Served with a dippable side of warm nacho cheese, the bold Mexican [indiscernible] fries are the perfect example of Taco Bell's belief, you shouldn't apologize the value, let's celebrate it. ", "As further commitment to becoming an easy brand, Taco Bell recently announced all access and initially focused on technology design to make Taco Bell easier for our consumers to access. This includes installing self-servicing kiosks in all of our restaurants by the end of 2019. ", "Delivery initiatives such our newly announced partnership with Grubhub, group vacation offerings and order ahead for scheduled pickup either in store or curve side. We understand the importance of technology and know there is great potential when we make it easy to order Taco Bell. ", "Taco Bell development remains robust. 2017 was a record setting year for both domestic and international restaurant openings. Internationally we entered 5 new countries and reached a significant milestone with our 400 international Taco Bell restaurants. We continue to see great success in several markets. In Canada, same store sales growth is strong with 11% growth in 2017 making it fourth consecutive years of at least high single digit same store sales growth. ", "Building on our domestic repeatable model, India introduced new innovation with the successful launch of the naked chicken Taco. ", "In Brazil we opened 20 units in 15 months. And additionally, we signed development agreements in both Brazil and Spain to open more than 200 restaurants over 10 years in each country. The international growth at Taco Bell is just beginning and has great potential over the long term. ", "Now moving on to unrivaled culture and talent. I'd like to highlight the recent talent additions we have made specifically to drive distinctive relevant and easy brands. Julie [indiscernible] joins us as Taco Bell U.S. President and is responsible for driving innovation, new store development and a frictionless customer experience through digital and technology initiatives. ", "[indiscernible] joins us as KFC U.S. Chief Marketing Officer responsible for developing and executing innovative marketing strategies as well as the brand's digital initiatives. And additionally [indiscernible] U.S. Chief Brand Officer and is responsible for building the brand with today's consumer overseeing marketing and food innovation teams. We are able to attract these great talents and so many others because of our global iconic brands, growth agenda and world-class culture. I firmly believe our culture is a competitive advantage and we are excited to welcome these leaders to Yum! and are confident they will help drive results throughout our organization. ", "In summary, the fourth quarter was a strong flow to the year and a hugely forward towards achieving our transformation objectives. The focus on our four key growth capabilities is the strong catalyst behind our successful results. ", "And now it gives me great pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Financial Officer, David Gibbs. ", "David Gibbs", "Thank you, Greg and good morning everyone. Today I will discuss our 2017 results. 2018 guidance, progress towards our transformation initiatives and two of our forward growth capabilities, bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. ", "First our 2017 results. I am especially pleased to report, we met or exceeded each component of our guidance. We delivered full year core operating profit growth of 7% despite headwinds from refranchising dilution, lapping a 53rd week and incremental media spend associated with Pizza Hut transformation agreement. Same store sales growth of 2% and net new unit growth of 3% delivered system sales growth of 5% excluding the 53rd week all within guidance. ", "Before I talk about 2018, I do want to discuss our effective tax rate excluding special items for the fourth quarter and full year. Both rates were lower than anticipated due to the timing of planned repatriation of earnings and the impact of tax reform. The majority of our expected repatriation was backend loaded for the year largely reflecting the timing of international refranchising transactions. ", "Given that most of our foreign industries have November 30th year end for US tax purposes, any earnings repatriated subsequent to this date will require to be tagged as part of the one-time toll charge included in US tax reform. ", "Our ex-special rates for the fourth quarter and full year were lower than anticipated because they did not include tax on those earnings repatriated after November 30th. Instead that tax was included in the toll charge that is part of our onetime special items charged for US tax reform of $434 million that we recorded in the fourth quarter. ", "Now looking at 2018, we do not expect any change to the underlying base operating profit growth of high single digits. However, there are several items which will affect our core operating profit growth in 2018. ", "First, and similar to 2017 we expect operating profit dilution as a result of the timing difference between refranchising restaurants and the associated G&A savings which is consistent with our transformation plans. This is expected to negatively impact operating profit by approximately six to seven percentage points. ", "Second is the revenue recognition accounting change which is required to be implemented beginning January 1st 2018. It's important to note that this does not reflect any change in our business model, the strength of our brands or our cash flows. It is solely a gap required change adjusting the timing of recognition of upfront fees received from franchisees and incentive payments made to franchisees. ", "The most significant driver of the change is requiring upfront fees received from franchisees to be amortized over the life of the franchise agreement. Previously upfront fees will recognize in full win received. As a result, and because this is a prospective application, we expect approximately two to three percentage points of negative impact to our operating profit. All in we are forecasting 2018 core operating profits to be about flat.", "Again, I want to reiterate we continue to expect underlying base operating profit growth to be strong and up high single digits. However, 2018 will be affected by these onetime items I discussed.", "Next, we expect same store sales growth of 2 to 3% and net new unit growth of 3 to 4% for the system sales growth of 5 to 6% in constant currency. This builds upon our systems sales growth of 4% during 2016, 5% in 2017 and is a step towards achieving our long-term bold goal of 7%. ", "We anticipate CapEx will be between 200 and $250 million. Note this is a step down from our 2017 CapEx of 318 million and is tracking towards our run rate CapEx of 100 million beginning in 2019. All details of our 2018 guidance can be found on the investor section of our website. ", "Finally, as a result of tax reform we anticipate an ongoing effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 22% compared to our historical rate of mid to upper 20s. While we are able to take advantage of the lower US tax rate, our benefit is somewhat muted by the cap on interest deductibility. The move to a territorial tax system is a positive for us given the high percentage of our taxable income that is earned outside the U.S. but this is largely offset by the impacts of a new tax on global intangible low tax income. Please note that we expect our 2018 tax rate to be slightly below the anticipated range I just provided. This is due to delayed applicability of the new tax on global intangible low tax income as well as a higher amount of interest deductibility in 2018 primarily given refranchising gains which will drive higher U.S. pretax earnings. ", "Turning now to our transformation initiatives designed to make Yum! brands more focused, more franchise and more efficient to deliver more growth to our shareholders. First, the focus on our four key growth capabilities has helped us accelerate net new unit growth and drive sustained positive same store sales growth. This focus is a big reason why we had increased confidence in achieving our long term bold goal of 7% system sales growth. ", "Second, on our journey to becoming more franchised, we sold 896 equity units during the fourth quarter for pretax proceeds of over $1 billion, ending the year at 97% franchise. We remain confident in our ability to reach at least 98% franchise by the end of 2018 and exceed $2 billion in after tax proceeds from our refranchising efforts. ", "Third, as a more efficient company, we ended the year with G&A excluding special items representing 2% of system sales, on our way to our goal of 1.7%. And as previously mentioned, we continue to expect run-rate CapEx beginning in 2019 of $100 million. ", "Each of these initiatives are designed to deliver more growth to our shareholders. During 2017, we've repurchased 26.6 million shares for $1.9 billion at an average price of $72. ", "Additionally, we paid $460 million in dividends for a total capital return of $2.3 billion in 2017. Further we were pleased to announce a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend for 2018 increasing from $0.30 a share to $0.36 a share. We value returning capital to our shareholders and we remain committed to returning between $6.5 billion and $7 billion from 2017 to 2019 through both share repurchases and dividends. After evaluating the impacts of tax reform, revenue recognition and our strategic partnership with Grubhub, we continue to expect that we will deliver at least $3.75 in EPS in 2019. ", "Now, before moving on to our growth drivers, I want to provide you with some details of the investments with Grubhub. Yum! is acquiring $200 million in primary common stock, an investment expected to provide Grubhub with additional liquidity to in part accelerate expansion of its industry leading U.S. delivery network, drive more orders to Yum! restaurants and further enhance the ordering the fulfillment experience for diners, restaurants and drivers. We are excited for this unique partnership which includes having a seat on the Grubhub board of directors and aligns with Yum! long term strategies to make our three brands easier for customers to access. ", "Next to our growth drivers. We've talked about our four key growth capabilities, fueling our decisions and results and Greg talked to you about two of them. Now I want to provide you with an update on the remaining two. Bold restaurant development and unmatched franchise operating capability. First, bold restaurant development, during 2017 we opened over 2600 growth units. If you think about it, this means across the globe we open over seven YUM brands restaurants every single day with one new restaurant approximately every three hours.", "On a net unit basis during 2017, we opened over 1400 restaurants. This is more than 200 additional net new units than last year and nearly 2600 total net new units over the last two years combined. We are very proud of the teams and franchisees that make this happen and commit to continuing this growth. ", "Next, to unmatched franchise operating capability. At KFC US, the team utilizes a voice of the customer program to measure operational results and better understand guest needs and feedback. The metrics are standardized among participating competitors and since launch in 2014 KFC US has moved from near the bottom to above average on key metrics including overall satisfaction, taste, perception of speed, friendliness and value. ", "With each of these metrics improving at least 10 percentage points. With the significant improvement can be attributed to the integrated back of house pack lines from the 2015 acceleration agreement with franchisees focus on value with the $5 fill up, $10 chicken share and $20 fill up and technology improvements to aid operations in labor deployment. ", "Regarding our - metrics at Taco Bell, both customer satisfaction and speed scores improved during our highest growing day part after 5 PM with customer satisfaction scores achieving a record high and up two percentage points over prior year. ", "Pizza Hut international continues to leverage technology to deliver superior customer experience and is testing GPS tracking of delivery drivers to enhance the customer experience. In markets with GPS tracking, customer satisfaction scores are over 10 percentage points higher. We understand the importance of an exceptional experience at our restaurants and are pleased with these operational improvements. ", "To summarize, 2017 was the first full year of our transformation journey and we are pleased with the progress made towards our goal while also achieving each components of our guidance for the year. We remain confident in our future and look forward to updating you throughout 2018 as we become a more focused, more franchised and more efficient company delivering more growth to our shareholders. ", "Now the team and I are happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from David Palmer, your line is open. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi thanks this is Eric on for Dave Palmer. Just wanted to touch on development for a second. I think you mentioned 3 or 4%-unit growth is your expectation this year which is an increase from I think 3% in 2017. Do you feel like you have the building blocks in place to accelerate development across your three brands? Maybe if you could touch on any commitments that you\u2019re excited about and then as a follow up to that, how much is the development commitments from refranchising contribute to unit growth this quarter? And how much you expect it to contribute in 2018? Thanks. ", "Greg Creed", "Yes, well obviously we\u2019re excited about the progress we\u2019re making on development as I mentioned the 2600 growth new units is really a record for the last decade or so and in the quarter itself we opened up a net of 732 units compared to the 661 we opened last quarter of 2016. So that\u2019s a quarterly increase of 71 units. ", "So, you can see we're making progress on the full year numbers, the quarterly numbers. There is momentum behind development. As far as how the refranchising plays into this, we've talked repeatedly about the fact that we're getting development commitments in the refranchising deals, but up until this last quarter, we hadn\u2019t done the majority of our franchising with close to 900 units being refranchised in the fourth quarter. Those all came along with the lot of significant development commitment.", "So, we're starting to see the benefits of the development commitments creeping in to the numbers that we're reporting, but I still think there is a lot more to come from those development commitments. And because we're typically made over a multiyear period, so we think this sets us up with momentum on the development front for several years to come. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Ivankoe from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ", "John Ivankoe", "Hi thank you very much. I have a couple of questions I think to relatively small on the Grubhub partnership if I may. And I'll just coming do only one Q3 if you can address small one. Firstly, what percentage of KFC or Taco Bell would currently have Grubhub delivery coverage, in another word how much of the systems could be covered as Grub stands today.", " Secondly, do you have a plan to point of sale implementation with the Grubhub platform and the point of sales at KFC and Taco Bell? ", "And then the third point are these starts on the board that certainly very interesting for a lot of different reasons to be on Grubhub. Do you think that there might be a longer-term opportunity to either outsource or perhaps augment your current inhouse delivery to more of an outsourced model with Grub? So, if you don't mind just those three points on the Grubhub partnership. ", "Greg Creed", "Let me take the first couple. As you know, in the U.S. we've got a couple of discounts with KFC. So right now, I think by the end of the year, we'll have -- Grubhub will cover probably about 80% of all of the restaurants that could deliver. From a KFC perspective, we're not delivering at the moment, we're just in a couple of test markets with KFC delivery. So, we have a lot of work obviously as we believe those test, expand those test, and start delivering. ", "I think we've said in the past that we've got close to 1500 Taco Bells already delivering, but this will expand obviously the capability for Taco Bell. So, what we're excited about is both KFC and Taco Bell is really as an opportunity to expand the presence that we've got in the number of stores that we can obviously bring closer to our customer. ", "On the POS system, obviously we're aligning the [indiscernible] systems, that work is obviously underway. It will be critical as a part of making it seems for our customer whether they order of our apps website or the Grubhub apps and website all that work is ongoing. ", "And I think on the last question was just, already joined the board and what the possibilities are for the Pizza Hut brand as a result of that. And I think that's one where the ongoing conversations about how both Grubhub and Pizza Hub can leverage as a partnership if there are ways to do so. But right now, this is mostly about the Taco Bell KFC relationship with Grubhub. ", "And I would also point out that this isn't just about delivery, it's about the ability to order online to Grubhub and pickup products at our restaurants. And Grubhub and Taco Bell and KFC are working diligently to integrate the POS as you mentioned to make the ordering process very quick to get the orders into the restaurants and to the consumers. And we have certain coverage ratios and targets in our agreements that when we hit them, we\u2019ll really unleash the power of the partnership. ", "John Ivankoe", "And is there a timeline for that technological marriage if you will, I think it's just been more difficult for a lot of brands over the past couple of years. I mean do you have, feel like you have an edge on that?", "David Gibbs", "Yeah, certainly that\u2019s a big part of this agreement is having an integrated POS system and yes there all sorts of internal timelines and schedules to get all of this work done. And I think we\u2019ll reveal details as we go on the journey with Grubhub but for today this is all about the announcement and the intention of having this be a really unique partnership with the Board CET investment and what we think is a great partner for us on the technology front. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer & Co. Your line is open.", "Brian Bittner ", "Thanks, good morning. I have two questions in like John I\u2019m just going to ask both of them at the same time and then listen to your answers. First, you know you talked about refranchising dilution being in 6 to 7% headwind to operating profits in \u201918 and these falls of headwind from \u201917 and you would said at the beginning of this process that refranchising net of G&A reductions will be neutral in totality. So, is this still your thinking and does that mean that 2019 naturally is a year where all this dilution reverses to accretion? That\u2019s just the first question. The second question is just simple one, on the comp guidance for 2018 how does Taco Bell fit into that comp guidance for overall Yum! just given we see it as difficult comparisons and its operating in a pretty intense US environment. Thanks guys.", "David Gibbs", "Okay on the refranchising question, obviously there is a lot of different factors in how refranchising plays out in or P&L. For example, we\u2019ve gotten ahead of ourselves in terms of selling Pizza Hut which are tend to be lower volume stores and have less dilution and therefore we\u2019ve got a lot more G&A in Pizza Hut as a proportion of their targeted cost. ", "So now we have higher volume stores to sell Taco Bell and KFC to finish off the refranchising process in 2018 and I think the comment that will this flip to being -- is this still a net new neutral exercise between the G&A and refranchising absolutely. We\u2019ve done all the math on that and they all balance out, but we\u2019ve probably got a little bit more benefits from the organic G&A cuts up until this point. Now there was 900 stores we sold in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll obviously have an impact on our operating profit in 2018. ", "So, taking all those factors into account, yes, it's still a net neutral math exercise between the refranchising dilution and the G&A savings and as you said 2019 will start to see more benefits of it versus the headwinds that\u2019s presenting for us in 2018. On the comp guidance, as you know we have provided the global comp guidance but we\u2019re not going to break out it by brand but just wanted Taco Bell sales to be there. ", "Greg Creed", "Yes, I would just say that I think Taco Bell has been competitive in the competitive market and as we saw with the Blueminatti $1which we just started the year with and as you\u2019ve all seen we have launched nacho fries at a $1. So obviously it\u2019s a competitive marketplace but what I like about the Taco Bell team is they are obviously quick to response to changes in the marketplace and I feel good about what we\u2019ve got on our calendar for 2018.", "David Gibbs", "I just want to go back and clarify one earlier comment, there was a question about coverage with Grubhub, obviously there is two ways Grubhub will be covering our restaurants. One will be through click and collect in the pickup process and we expect that we can get very good coverage on that very quickly once we turn all the systems on. And then there is a different measure for delivery coverage. We have specific measures by brand. We'll share more of that overtime, but I think the 80% is more -- that Greg quoted was more of a general number. But I think we'll give you more specifics on that as we get into the relationships with Grubhub. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sara Senatore from Bernstein. Your line is open. ", "Sara Senatore ", "Yeah, hi. Thank you. So just a couple of questions please. First is on the tax benefits and all the moving pieces there. You've retained the total amount of expected return to shareholders. And I was just trying to understand if there is any extent to which you're reinvesting some of that tax or benefit or it was sort of contemplated in the initial guidance? ", "And then I do have a question also just about the Grubhub partnership. We hear from other companies that franchises need to see a certain level of incrementality for these partnerships to work. Is that something that you've worked through from your perspective? It's just interesting for me to see company like Yum! has so much experience with inhouse delivery from Pizza Hut partner in sort of an outsourcing way. So just trying to understand the economics for you in the franchises. ", "Greg Creed", "Thanks, Sara. On the tax savings, and the returning to shareholders. As you know, we're in the process of transforming Yum! into a free cash flow machine. So, we don't have any needs on cash that we haven\u2019t been able to meet with our own cash generated. So consistent with the transformation the plan is to return the incremental cash from tax reform to shareholders. ", "On the Grubhub deal, and the franchise economics, we did a thorough process in terms of understanding the economic to franchises, understanding the different options for us. And it was a really important part of this process for us to make sure that we ensured our franchises have good economics. We leveraged our scale and our marketing cloud and what we can bring to our partners. And we think we have a deal, we're not going to go into the commercial terms, and we think we have the deal set up that our franchises will absolutely embrace and it will drive incremental profitability and sales for them. ", "David Gibbs", "Yeah, I think in the test markets, we I think have got a couple of test markets going in the moment. Indianapolis, Louisville, [indiscernible] and to an extent I think to Orlando. But I was talking to the restaurant general manager in the test and the good news is that they do believe they are seeing incremental occasions and they do believe they're seeing much higher check. So, I think what delivery promises in these very early test markets, the guys and girls are actually running this on a daily basis are seeing that benefit, we're encouraged by that and we're encouraged by expanding those tests. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Stifel. Your line is open. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, good morning. I just have a couple of questions. So, first Greg, are you concerned that Grubb having a stronger competitive position with your investment allows more non-Yum! chains to start using delivery which would add delivery competitors for Pizza Hut?", "Greg Creed", "I think that certainly the investment that we\u2019re making at Grub Hub we believe allows them to expand their coverage and obviously expanding their coverage gives more access as David has pointed out to both pick-up and delivery which obviously benefits us. We spend a lot of time obviously on this partnership and I think you know as we said you know we love the management team, we love their business model. We see this as an opportunity for both companies and we\u2019re excited about you know the opportunity for us to use Grub Hub to get our brands easier access to our customers. ", "David Gibbs", "And obviously our brands are benefitting Pizza Hut included are benefitting from the consumers embracing delivery, we\u2019re seeing the Pizza Hut delivery business climb as a percentage of the Pizza Hut business. So, we\u2019re excited about delivering for our Taco Bell and KFC brands and very confident in the model that we have with Pizza Hut with today being one that can benefit from this change in consumer's taste. ", "Unidentified Analyst ", "Okay. Thank you and then David how many -- I may have missed this, but how many development commitments came with the stores that were refranchised during the fourth quarter?", "David Gibbs", "That\u2019s not a number that we\u2019re going to start to get into reveal other than to say it varies by deal, some deals where we have lot of development opportunities, obviously we attach a lot more commitments to it, other deals where they\u2019re in mature market and fully penetrated you can imagine we put less in. And our experience with the development commitments is that you don\u2019t get a 100% follow through on every single one of them. So, I don\u2019t want to start releasing numbers and then having to revise them constantly. But it\u2019s a sizeable amount, these isn\u2019t just a few commitments, these are very significant commitments to building stores typically over the next three to five years. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line if Geoffrey Bernstein from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Parekh Patel", "Hi, this is Parekh Patel on for Jeff. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of questions have been asked about, corporate tax reforms but if I could just shift to the standpoint of the consumer, wondering if you guys had done any research or analysis in the past in instances where consumers saw a significant increase to disposable income, be it from past tax rate benefits or maybe the lower gas prices we saw a couple of years ago or maybe, just any color you might have would be helpful? Thanks. ", "Greg Creed", "Yes, we haven\u2019t done any specific research around the tax reform but I think as you said in the past with lower gas prices the people have more disposable income in their pockets. They tend to spend it, so I think anything that ends up with people having more money in their pockets is a good thing. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Jason West from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jason West ", "Okay, sorry. Yeah, just going back to the guidance, it sounds like excluding the revenue rec changes that are 2 to 3% increase in EBIT embedded which is a little lower than the guide for \u201917. Just want to clarify I mean is that primarily because like you said that the brands that are being refranchised or is there anything else kind of changing in your view in terms of the \u201918 growth rate in the business. ", "Greg Creed", "Well I\u2019ll walk you through the guidance again on operating profit. The refranchising headwinds are about six to seven points, revenue recognition is hitting us for 2 to 3 points, so that together those things are 8 to 10 points of headwinds. We actually get a little bit of a benefit from lapping the Pizza Hut and KFC transformation agreements year-over-year '17 to '18. So, you can see how that 8 to 10 effectively ends up being high-single digits with what we've been very consistent on for the transformed Yum1 growth model. ", "Jason West ", "Okay. So that refranchising headwind would have been a little less maybe in '17 than 6 to 7 is that fair?", "Greg Creed", "Exactly, that's fair. Exactly. ", "Jason West ", "Okay. and then the last thing. ", "Greg Creed", "Just to clarify, we outlined the headwinds from refranchising dilution in our 2017 guidance. And we've talked about that as in terms of percentage points, and that was 1 to 2 points of headwinds. So that should give you the walk. 1 to 2 in '17 versus the 6 to 7 in '18. ", "Jason West", "Okay that make sense. And then just for our knowledge, can you explain again the tax issue with the intangibles that you mentioned and how that sort of holds back you're the downside I guess on your tax rate. And is that a cash issue or is that really a non-cash type item?", "Greg Creed", "It is a cash issue. And obviously it's a part of the tax cut that's fairly complex. And some people have talked about a little bit. but essentially, it's designed for income that you have offshore that is not coming from tangible assets, it's coming from intangible assets. And it's an offset to the benefits we get from the territorial tax system. We're obviously digging into all of this trying to better understand and as I mentioned it will have delayed applicability to us because a lot of our international entity tax years. so, we'll have more to share on that as we go forward. ", "David Gibbs", "Alright. Thank you very much everyone for joining us, and with that I'll turn it back over to Greg. ", "Greg Creed", "Yeah thanks Dave. So, thank you all for joining us on the call today, I appreciate it. I think in summary, I'd say that Q4 was a solid finish of the strong year. We've made great progress on our transformation. I think the keys of the underlying growth remains strong in the business. We're obviously very excited about our strategic partnership with Grubhub. And that's all to ensure that we are distinct, relevant and easy. Thanks for joining us everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.
