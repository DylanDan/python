Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.", "The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-out or dial-in on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.", "At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. Your line will be muted when you complete your question.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.", "Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projections.", "For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables of our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 3, 2016, and also in the slides accompanying this presentation that are available on the Investor Relations page of our website, zoetis.com.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. Our performance this quarter once again demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and the predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health industry.", "True to our diverse business model, we continue generating result from many different sources, both in the U.S. and international markets and across different species and therapeutic areas; and our portfolio help us deliver steady results over the long-term despite some economic and market challenges that exist.", "Our R&D investment is maintaining a high level of productivity with new products like SIMPARICA as well as lifecycle innovation and market expansions for key product lines such as DRAXXIN, VANGUARD and VERSICAN Plus. We also combine this internal investment with external partnerships and opportunities with products like SILEO, the new noise aversion medicine we are marketing for dogs in the U.S.", "In addition to sales and innovation, we are demonstrating our leadership in the animal health industry with the profitability and performance of our operations. We have been executing on the operational efficiency program we announced last year; and we are on track to deliver more than $300 million dollars in savings and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% by the end of 2017. We believe this achievement in efficiency and profitability is unparallel in the animal health industry.", "Looking more closely at our second quarter results, operational revenue was up 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As you will recall, this year our revenue growth and focus will continue to reflect the impact from changes related to the operational efficiency program we put in place in 2015. Those SKU rationalization and business changes in countries like Venezuela and India continue to partially offset more significant gains in our core business.", "Excluding these impacts and the impacts of acquisitions, our normalized organic operational growth will be 9%; and on the same basis, our companion animal products grew 15% and our livestock products grew 5%. Paul will provide more details on the bridge from reported to normalized organic operational growth in his remarks.", "The growth in companion animal was based on the strong performance by APOQUEL, as well as our recently launched vaccines and SIMPARICA. In livestock, we saw growth coming from a recovery of cattle business in the U.S. In swine, the positive performance from the International segment was offset by a decline in the U.S. And in poultry, we declined globally due to market conditions and pressure from competition.", "We are improving our cost of sales and gross margin as we refine our manufacturing network, execute our efficiency plan and focus on continuous improvement. On an operational basis, our adjusted operating expenses were flat in the second quarter, even as we grew revenues significantly; thanks to the ownership and mindset of our colleagues and expense management discipline.", "The growth in revenues, gross margin improvement and discipline on expenses resulted in adjusted net income growth of 22% operationally; once again, supporting our long-term and value proposition to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue.", "We always emphasize a full year view of our business to account for some of the seasonal fluctuation and timing patterns in animal health; and we continue to see good progress through that lens. We're increasing our guidance for 2016 based on our strong performance in the first half of the year, the continued strength of our business model and the confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year. Paul will go through updated to 2016 guidance in his remarks.", "Now let me turn to the innovation investment that are fueling our performance this year and positioning us well for the future value creation. At the beginning of the year, I said we needed to execute flawlessly on our new product launches; and I'm very pleased with our progress.", "In the case of APOQUEL, it has become a very positive story. For the first half of 2016, we have exceeded $100 million in revenue; until May, we have been supplying APOQUEL with no restrictions. Recently, we have launched in additional markets such as Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia; and in the coming months, we plan to introduce APOQUEL in the rest of the approved markets such as Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, as well as Singapore and Hong Kong.", "SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide for dogs is now available to customers in U.S. and most of the European countries; and we expect it to be further deployed in Canada, Brazil and New Zealand during 2016.", "We are pleased with the launch of SIMPARICA, despite being the most recent entrant in a very competitive oral flea and tick market for dogs. At launch, SIMPARICA was introduced with extensive published data, showing its rapid onset of action, its sustained persistence of protection against fleas and ticks and other advantages over various oral and topical parasiticides on the market.", "While new products have been a big lift for us recently, we continue to build on our major established product lines and focus on the lifecycle innovation that will keep our portfolio strong and sustainable. One of the strengths of our R&D organization is ability to innovate across the phases of care that veterinarians encounter; phases that includes prediction, prevention and treatment.", "Our R&D begins with an understanding of the biology of the diseases, their pathways and how they work. Then, we complement that with customer insights that come from our commercial teams working shoulder to shoulder with veterinarians and producers; and we apply this knowledge across the phases of healthcare.", "We use innovations in genetics, diagnostics and increasingly digital platforms to help predict risks or detect diseases in species. This means the ability to breed healthier and more productive animals, to detect disease earlier and to develop practices informed by bioinformatics and digital applications that capitalize on the use of big data.", "In the second quarter, for example, we continue to expand our business diagnostic franchise into new markets with an additional approval in Spain for livestock test kits. These point-of-care test kits deliver accurate, fast and clear results that give the customers timely and informed diagnosis without disrupting their clinical consultation.", "Our customers are also seeking for new solutions to get ahead and help prevent infectious diseases. We have been placing a greater emphasis on our vaccine portfolio, some of which we introduced last year and others that we continue to expand in terms of approvals and geographies.", "For example, in the second quarter, we expanded our VERSICAN Plus and the VANGUARD vaccine franchises with new approvals in Europe and Canada. VERSICAN Plus, a combination of vaccines that protect dogs against 10 canine diseases was first approved in European Union in 2014; and this quarter, we received additional approvals in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands for a smaller combination of the vaccine. Additionally, VERSICAN Plus Rabies achieved approval for a new claim in European Union three years duration of immunity.", "Meanwhile VANGUARD B Oral and VANGUARD crLyme vaccines were approved in Canada after having just received their U.S. approval in December 2015. And finally, across the phases of healthcare, we develop medicines to treat sick animals. DRAXXIN, one of the Zoetis' largest global product lines and was first introduced in 2015 (sic) [2005]; and this quarter, we received approval of a new label claim in Europe for DRAXXIN and DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective for treating swine respiratory disease.", "In addition to our internal R&D, we also look for partners that can help broaden and strengthen our product portfolio. For example, in May, Zoetis launched in the U.S. a product called SILEO under an exclusive agreement with Orion Corporation. SILEO is the first and only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of noise aversion in dogs. And if you were in the U.S. this July 4, you probably read about or heard about this exciting new product that brought hope to many dog owners.", "In summary, we have continued our positive momentum through the first half of the year based on the strength of our U.S. portfolio and dedicated Zoetis colleagues. We continue to reap the benefits of a productive, world-class R&D organization focused on new products and lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 products lines. And we are executing on key product launches and our operational efficiency program to ensure our long-term growth and value creation.", "With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Another solid quarter with lots of good things to cover, so let's get to it, starting with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. Then, I'll provide some commentary on a number of areas that I believe will be helpful to understanding our quarter, our first half of 2016 and what you might expect for the balance of 2016.", "Before I start, I want to point out that the SKU rationalization and the changes in business models we made in several international countries continue to have an impact on our revenue in 2016 and growth in revenue for 2016 compared with 2015.", "First, we're confident that the steps that we took and are taking to improve efficiency will put Zoetis in a position to deliver higher profits and cash flows and to better grow those profits and cash flows from here forward. Second, while we're going through this transition, we believe it's important that we and you have visibility into how to the go-forward portion of our business is performing. So we prepared analyses that strictly eliminated SKUs out of our revenue to show the underlying growth of the go-forward business.", "On our website, you'll see slides and you'll find a table \u2013 or tables rather that show our reported revenue growth for the second quarter and for the first half of 2016; and then walk you through the impacts of foreign currency, the operational efficiency changes related to SKUs and other business model changes, recent M&A; and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year.", "The objective here is not to divert attention from the reported revenue growth rates; it's to provide perspective on how you might think about our future growth prospect in our to-be state. While we use the phrase operational growth, that means excluding the impact of changes in FX rate versus the same period in the prior year; when we say normalized organic growth for any period compared with the prior year period, that means excluding the impact of FX, the eliminated SKUs, the business changes outside the U.S., the extra days in the first quarter of the year and the impact of recent M&A. So with that lengthy preamble, let's talk about the quarter.", "Revenue grew 6% on an operational or constant currency basis. We posted an adjusted gross margin of 67.9% in the quarter, resulting in adjusted gross profit growing faster than revenue; up 11% on an operational basis. Adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis, reflecting the great progress we've made on our efficiency initiative.", "As Juan Ram\u00f3n said, we're on track to deliver more than the previously announced $300 million in savings associated with the efficiency initiative; and those savings are considered in our guidance for 2017. The combination of 11% operational growth of adjusted gross profit and the flat adjusted operating expenses enabled us to grow adjusted EBIT for the quarter by 25% on an operational basis.", "Below the operating line, we had higher interest expense and higher effective tax rate on adjusted income, which together reduced the operational growth rate of adjusted net income to 22%. We put adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 on the board for the quarter. And the strong performance in the first half of the year enabled us to increase our guidance for the full year 2016 by 3% \u2013 excuse me, $0.03 per share across the range; a solid quarter and a solid first half of the year for sure.", "So a bit deeper dive on revenue. The star of the quarter geographically was the U.S., up 10%, and by global business it was companion animal, up 13%; and both of those are on an operational basis. Of course, APOQUEL was an important driver of both. APOQUEL sales in the quarter were roughly $60 million. APOQUEL has a lot of revenue growth still ahead. And with SIMPARICA and a number of other recently introduced companion animal products, we expect our companion animal business to drive above market revenue growth through 2017.", "Our International segment was up 2% operationally, and the global livestock business grew about 1% operationally. Both were disproportionately impacted by our SKU reductions and the changes we made to our operating models in countries, including Venezuela and India. On the flipside, global livestock is benefiting from M&A, mostly PHARMAQ.", "Now let's talk about the components of our operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. APOQUEL accounted for 3% of that growth. New products other than APOQUEL, including our new companion animal vaccines, SIMPARICA, SYNOVEX ONE and SILEO, to name a few, added 2%.", "In-line products added 4%, with 3% coming from increased prices and 1% for volume; and M&A accounted for another 2%. The impact of the SKU reductions and the changes in business models reduced our growth by some 500 basis points; and that gets you to the 6% operational revenue growth for the quarter. Pretty good, right? Once again, our revenue growth came from a number of sources and reflects the strength of our diverse business model.", "Let's turn to our two segments, U.S. and International, starting with the U.S. Overall, the U.S. business was up 10% in the quarter. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. grew 11% in the quarter. U.S. companion animal business was up 17% mainly due to the ramp of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA and the introduction of other new products. Half of the growth was driven by the ramp of APOQUEL.", "U.S. livestock grew 2% with a 4% pick up from increased selling prices that were offset in part by volume decreases related to some of the SKU reductions. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. livestock business delivered growth of 5%, compared to a 9% decline in Q1 of this year. The business rebounded nicely in Q2 and the year-to-date normalized organic growth rate for the U.S. livestock business was negative 3%.", "After the first quarter, there was some concern out there about the health of our U.S. livestock business. For the avoidance of doubt, after a slow start, we expect our U.S. livestock business to deliver growth for the full year 2016 on a normalized organic basis. Within U.S. livestock, cattle, especially beef cattle, was particularly strong as the herd size and placements in feedlots were increasing and drove higher demand for our high-value injectable anti-infectives, vaccines, parasiticides and the recently launched SYNOVEX ONE implants.", "U.S. swine products experienced a decline due to competition for Fostera PCV vaccines, new restrictions on the use of some of our products for pork exports to China, a decline of PEDv revenue as the disease is no longer prevalent and some eliminated SKUs.", "U.S. poultry revenue declined in the quarter with the impact of SKU rationalization more than offsetting growth from the increased use of our health maintenance products and MFAs for antibiotic flea production; products like Zoamix, for example.", "On to the International segment, revenue from our International segment was up 2% operationally. On a normalized organic basis, the growth rate was 7%. On the same normalized organic basis, the international companion animal business led the way, up 10%, while international livestock was up 5% in the quarter; again, both of those are on a normalized organic basis.", "It's worth spotlighting a few countries for you. China was up $14 million or 49% operationally. Pork prices in China were relatively high leading to favorable conditions for pork producers and for our swine portfolio, including products like DRAXXIN, EXCEDE and our vaccines. About one-third of the growth in China was driven by products purchased by producers to stock up ahead of label changes for some of our products. Finally, we had a very successful spring promotion that drove increased sales of our REVOLUTION and DECTOMAX products in China.", "In Brazil, cattle and companion animal sales were strong, but partially offset by a weakness in poultry. The cattle portion of livestock in Brazil enjoyed favorable market conditions, leading to strong performance from our vaccines and parasiticides. We also saw increased adoption of IMPROVAC in the swine business.", "Across the portfolio, we also benefited from increased selling prices. The poultry business saw high input prices and increased restrictions on exportation to Japan that made for a challenging market for poultry producers and saw us lose a few accounts based on price. For the quarter, Brazil grew 6% operationally.", "Australia posted a solid 10% operational growth for the quarter, led by the launch of APOQUEL, the success of a promotional campaign for REVOLUTION and sales of anti-infectives for cattle.", "On the negative side of the growth ledger, in the UK, we saw our sales decline 21% operationally. The biggest factor, nearly half the decline was due to weather. A wet winter to spring delayed the cattle sheep turnout seasons; and that was a factor. The second quarter was also negatively impacted as we were in the process of shifting the acquired Abbott products to our distribution and we saw the channel accelerate purchases into Q1 and work off the inventory in Q2. Year-to-date, the UK business is up 3% operationally.", "Finally, the grouping in other emerging countries declined 5% operationally with the biggest drags being Venezuela and the SKU reductions. We saw growth across most of the countries in this grouping, including through the addition of PHARMAQ revenue in Chile.", "So on revenue, high level, the beat goes on. Growth from many sources in a diversified model that enables us to overcome softness in parts of our business with strength in other areas.", "Now let's shift to the rest of the P&L. We posted a high gross margin, 67.9% in the second quarter. But before we all start high-fiving each other, let's look at the factors that led to the 250 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Of the improvement, roughly a third came from price increases; a third from a mix shift toward the high-margin companion animal products; and a third came from other areas, mostly improvements in our supply chain efficiency. These three net positives experienced a bit of a headwind due to unfavorable foreign currency.", "Our gross margin has been improving, but it's not a one-way ratchet and there are some seasonal elements that we expect to come into play in the second half of 2016. For example, sales of our livestock products are greater as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year; and pricing promotions heading into the fall can lessen our net selling prices and thereby reduce gross margins in the period.", "These factors are expected to result in our reporting lower gross margins in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. And finally, there's, of course, FX. Predicting the timing and magnitude of FX changes on the cost of goods sold and on gross margin in short periods is very difficult. So that's a lot of discussion designed to caution you about assuming that our guidance for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for 2016 and 2017 are conservative.", "There's good news here. We fully expect our gross margin to continue to improve over time based on increased selling prices, increased sales from our companion animal products versus livestock and increased efficiency on our supply chain. But the upward journey will not be linear quarter to quarter.", "Turning to adjusted operating expenses. There is really not a lot to say except that we're on track to take out more than our target of $300 million of operating cost by year-end, so we enter 2017 in our new leaned out state. Total adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis when compared to Q2 of 2015.", "Note that our operating expense base is not static. We've added costs, selling, marketing and R&D to the base via the PHARMAQ acquisition and to support the launch of SIMPARICA and we may consider investing in promotion of certain key products or incremental R&D. The purpose of the efficiency initiative was to eliminate non-productive expenditures, not to ignore high-value investments we can make in our business.", "At this stage, our to-be operating expense structure is what you see in our 2017 guidance table. We continue to demonstrate excellent expense discipline through the second quarter, and that combined with the gross margin improvement enabled us to post operational growth of adjusted EBIT of 25% for the quarter.", "Below the operating line, we had increased interest expense due to the note issuance in Q4 that funded the PHARMAQ acquisition and pre-funded the $400 billion of debt that matured in the first quarter of the year. And our effective tax rate on adjusted income increased by some 100 basis points, mostly due to the change in our tax status in Belgium.", "Bottom line, our adjusted net income grew operationally 22% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% operationally, about 100 basis points faster than adjusted net income, as our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 2016 were almost 1% less than in Q2 of 2015.", "Couple of additional factors, I think, that you need to think about for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. First, as always, FX. While there has been a bit of volatility in FX rates recently, notably with the British pound and the euro, the FX impact on the balance of our year and into 2017 is little changed from our last guidance update.", "The overall impact on our future expectations for our International operations, based on FX rates, in late July are negligible. That said, FX rates had a negative impact on our reported revenue and profit rates, decreasing revenue growth in Q2 by some 300 basis points compared with Q2 of 2015 and adjusted net income growth by some 800 basis points. Contrast that with a 700-basis-point drag on reported revenue growth in Q1 and a 1,300-basis-point drag on adjusted net income in Q1.", "So as we had hoped on the last call, the impact of FX rates on our reported growth is moderating. Regardless, we continue to measure ourselves on a constant currency or operational basis.", "Next, the SKU reductions, including the changes we made to our business models in places like Venezuela and India. As we communicated on our last call, we expect the SKU reductions and business changes to decrease revenue growth by some 500 basis points for the full year 2016. In Q1, the impact was roughly 400 basis points; in Q2, it was roughly 500 basis points; and year-to-date, it was roughly 500 basis points. I'll point out, there's a little bit of rounding in there.", "You can see the impact of the SKU reductions in business model changes on the revenue growth in the charts that are on our website that I mentioned earlier; and I call your attention to those. I think they're helpful.", "On to one-time costs, I won't use this time to walk through the table in the press release, but want to call your attention to a contra expense item from the reversal of a portion of our severance accrual. At the time we recorded the accrual, we based it on the best information available. As it's worked out, we expect to pay out a little bit less in severance than we had thought, mainly due to a greater level of voluntary attrition than expected. From a cash out the door perspective that's a good thing for us.", "For the avoidance of doubt, the reversal did not increase our adjusted net income, but it did increase our reported GAAP net income in the quarter and was a factor in narrowing the gap between adjusted earnings and Generally Accepted Accounting Principle earnings.", "Finally, on to guidance. Today, we're updating our guidance for the full year of 2016 for a couple of things. We've increased our revenue guidance range by $25 million to reflect the strength of our business and our improved visibility now that we're through the first half of 2016. And we moved our expectations for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue from a range of 33% to 34%, to approximately 33%, so the favorable end of the range.", "Adjusted EBIT projections have improved in a similar fashion, so that's been updated too. We also updated our one-time costs to reflect the lower expectations for the severance point I just talked about. All other categories remain the same and the result is that we've raised our guidance range for 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 to the range of $1.86 to $1.93 per share. Note that the operational growth rate for adjusted net income implied by our guidance increased by 100 basis points and is now a range of 10% to 14%. The majority of the increase in our guidance is operational, not FX-related.", "Now, we can all do the math into what our guidance implies for the second half of the year for adjusted net income per share and you may think that that outlook is anomalous, given the second half revenue is expected to exceed revenue in the first half of the year. Here are a couple of observations about the phasing of our business in 2016.", "First, we do expect second half revenues to exceed the first half, that's a good start. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate lower gross margins in the second half of the year than seen in the first half due to mix and promotional programs reducing net selling prices and, therefore, gross margins.", "Next, our major promotional spending and operating expenses in support of our various product franchises are more weighted to the back half of the year. And finally, our R&D spending also skews to the second half of the year. Generally, the benefits of the increased sales expected in the second half of the year compared with the first may be more than offset by reduced gross margins, and the phasing of spending on promotional programs and R&D.", "So you all know I don't like to talk about quarters, but here are a couple of tips for phasing Q3 and Q4 2016. We expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter. We expect gross margins in the second half to be below those in Q1 and Q2. Selling expenses are expected to be heavier in the second half of the year, particularly heavy in Q4; and R&D spending in the second half is expected to be higher than the first half and heaviest in Q4.", "From adjusted net income perspective, Q3 may be the low quarter for the year. What's the most important is that we raised our full year 2016 guidance at revenue by $25 million and at adjusted earnings per share by $0.03. This is all good stuff. Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We expect a more detailed look at 2017 at the time we report our third quarter.", "That's it from me. Keith, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us more color on why you think livestock sales should continue to improve in second half 2016, especially since some of your competitors posted disappointing livestock sales this quarter? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Well, livestock is a combination of many species. Let's start with cattle and let's start with cattle in the U.S. Cattle in the U.S. have two different segments, beef and dairy. In beef, we have seen that the number of animals, it's larger than the previous year by 3%. In the second quarter also we saw that the number of placement in the feedlot increased by 5%. On the total year, we expect that the number of animals will be about 3% higher than 2015; and also the placement on the feedlot during the second half will be lower than in the second quarter we expect also to grow by about 3%.", "With all this, we expect that the cattle business for beef in the U.S. will be positive. We have seen also improvement in Australia because of the weather conditions. We have seen also that the fundamentals of the Brazilian remains very strong with even increasing exportations. So in our opinion, the cattle business for beef will be positive for the year.", "Dairy, prices are having a negative impact in the profitability of farmers around the world. In the U.S., we expect that the business will not be \u2013 or revenues coming from dairy will not be a significant driver of growth; although we have seen also that so far farmers are not reducing the number of animals, so which is also a good indication that they also expect improvement in pricing in the second half or first half of 2017.", "Swine, and for us as we said, in the international business is doing extremely well. We expect this trend to continue in the second half. In the U.S., we are facing some competitive challenge that we also expect to start solving in the fourth (sic) [fourth quarter 2016] and first quarter of 2017. And poultry is the area in where we expect probably less positive evolution for our portfolio. But, in general, we expect that livestock at the end of the year will be showing a positive growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much. Juan Ram\u00f3n, can you talk about longer term goals that you've got for SIMPARICA and SILEO? How do you think those products over time will end up sizing compared to APOQUEL? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Well, we expect SIMPARICA being a key product in our portfolio. And we think that SIMPARICA and SIMPARICA also as a platform for adding new products into the parasiticide franchise will be an important product. We mentioned that we expect this product to generate more than $100 million. Based on the current trends of the market switching more into oral and moving away from topicals will represent a higher opportunity for SIMPARICA.", "For SIMPARICA, we also are implementing our approach in lifecycle innovation from the very beginning. So we expect also to increase or to improve the label of SIMPARICA very soon with new ticks and also new indications and using SIMPARICA as a platform to combine the active ingredient of SIMPARICA with other active ingredients that will extend the protection of dogs for any type of parasiticide. We will be also working on how to use SIMPARICA active ingredient also to develop products for cats. So, overall, we consider that SIMPARICA as a platform will be a very strong product in our portfolio.", "SILEO, it's a product that \u2013 it's showing that why we are the product of choice in the animal health industry. It's also combining our internal effort with external collaborations. We obtained the license from SILEO from Orion Corporation for the U.S. And SILEO got very good support in terms of communication at the time of the launch. And it will not be a large product in our portfolio, but it's adding solutions to our customers and definitely it's increasing the relevance of Zoetis in terms of providing any type of needs to our customers.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great, guys. Maybe I can slip in two quick ones. SIMPARICA, you just mentioned the label expansion. What about plans for a DTC similar to what we've seen from some of the competitive offerings. And then if so, on the DTC, Paul, is that embedded into some of that promotion expenses that you mentioned in the back half of the year?", "And then also, if I can just ask one on APOQUEL. I think you threw out $60 million versus $50 million last quarter. What do you feel like inventory looks like in the channel, people who were sort of trying to horde or stockpile that in the early days? Thanks, guys.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Let me start with SIMPARICA and then I will ask Paul to answer on the APOQUEL question. So definitely we see SIMPARICA as a strong candidate for DTC promotion. But we also we want to make sure that the product has enough penetration in the market to benefit for this type of investment. And we'll consider this opportunity when we have the product well established in the U.S. market, and we expect that to be in 2017. In terms of APOQUEL, I will ask Paul to answer the question on the inventory channel.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "Sure. And I'll come back and hit the DTC question as well. With respect to APOQUEL and the channel, I think we saw a much more normalized pull-through of APOQUEL in Q2 than we had in Q1. Anybody that wants APOQUEL can get it now. They can order what they want. And so, we're starting to see a more normalized or a matching between our revenues and the products that are moving out through the various clinics where it's been stocked.", "You hit it right on the head. I mean, earlier when people were not quite convinced that we've put the supply chain issues behind us, people were hording it or holding it in the office to ensure they had supply. But that is, from our perspective, less and now you're seeing normal stocking and pull-through of the product. There may be pockets where it's still there, but much more normalized; and we're excited about prospects for APOQUEL.", "With respect to DTC, and if you think about DTC for potentially two products, it's APOQUEL and it could be SIMPARICA, I'd just say that within our guidance or within our OpEx guidance for 2016 and 2017, there are dollars allocated for promotional programs, including DTC. I think when I talk about \u2013 and during my prepared remarks, not ignoring opportunities to invest and say, we made assumptions about the level of promotional spend against all of our product franchises. And it's currently embedded within our guidance for 2016 and 2017 to the extent that we see great returns from certain promotional activities, we may well increase them in the future. But for now, they're baked in.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Let me add one comment of APOQUEL. And in APOQUEL, we have seen that most of the use of the product has been in chronic conditions. Now the effort of our people, it's really to promote the product to expand also the use to acute indication. That is something that we are confident that over time the opportunity of APOQUEL will continue growing.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "Yeah. As long as you went there. Some great statistics that I think are helpful, but people think about APOQUEL and the potential for APOQUEL, whether it's in the U.S. or outside. If you take the universe of itchy dogs, over half of itchy dogs are considered acute. They have average treatment days of a couple of weeks. And so, on a percentage of the market basis, it's not great, but there is a lot of opportunity for us there. And of course the thought is the next largest group in terms of a percentage are the seasonal itchy dogs and then the smallest is the chronic. About 20% are chronic; it's a little less than 20% are chronic.", "And, of course, our view is that when you have an acute situation and you bring a dog is there's that opportunity where that dog can get excellent relief from using a product like APOQUEL. And to the extent that it turns out that that dog has seasonal issues, then, well, it can move into a different category.", "So there is a lot of opportunity here for us. We started off by really focusing on that slightly less than 20% of the market that was in the chronic category, albeit when they go on to therapy, they go on for a large number of days. I'll stop there.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "All right. Thanks. On your restructuring, SKU rationalization, overall cost structure initiatives, how should we think about the quarterly progression throughout the year? What would you \u2013 or would you say you're running ahead of plan? What were you able to accomplish in the quarter and what's left to do on that front?", "And then my second question is on capital deployment. Can you just sort of outline your near term and longer term priorities there, particularly as cash flow builds heading into next year? What is your guidance also assuming in the way of share repurchases? And if I can ask just a really quick housekeeping question \u2013 if you haven't broken it out yet, the U.S. sales and International sales of APOQUEL? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Okay. So I will answer the first question on \u2013 I think it was a question on APOQUEL? But let me \u2013 did you ask...", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "It was the restructuring process.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Restructuring. Okay. So let me cover that. So we are ahead of our plans, and we mentioned that we expect that to generate more than $300 million. The initial target was $300 million. So also the good news is that we are ahead in the implementation and we'll generate in 2016 also higher savings than initially expected.", "In terms of the SKU rationalization, plans are in line with expectation. We have eliminated the majority of the SKUs now. There are still some few SKUs that we decided to keep until we have some other product that will be replacing these SKUs. So we'll minimize the impact of the reduction.", "And in terms of the plans that we included as divestment or exiting, we did almost all the work now. Countries that we changed the distribution model has been fully implemented. So we are definitely extremely pleased with all the progress that we made in this program. So, Paul, will talk about the capital deployment.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "Yeah, I will take capital deployment. I think we continue to look for ways to invest our cash flow back in our business where we could earn the highest returns. Certainly to M&A and as we said pretty consistently, to the extent that there's not a better call on our cash flow within our business for M&A, then when will distribute it back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We are currently purchasing shares at the rate of about 75 million a quarter. We have a program that runs through the balance of 2016; and we're obviously in the process of looking at 2017 and beyond and thinking through what we'll do there.", "But, Erin, you bring up a great point and it's something we talk about quite a bit. 2016, we don't really demonstrate through our quarter results the real cash-generating properties of our business. 2017 will be the first opportunity for the market to see in our reported results the ability of this company to generate significant free cash flow.", "And the reasons for that are the obvious ones that we're completing our standup from Pfizer, and that's been expensive and lengthy; we are completing \u2013 or generally completing the payments for implementing our efficiency initiative and we hope to put those behind us by the end of 2016. And so, when we enter 2017, you're going to see a much more normalized level of cash generation from this company. And as we generate that cash, we will stick to the model of looking for ways to deploy inside, outside in value-generative M&A. And last and certainly not least, in the form of our dividends and share repurchases.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Okay. So you also asked about sales for APOQUEL U.S./international. U.S. is about 75% of the total amount that we reported for the first half and 25% for international.", "Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Is that the first half?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "First half, yes.", "Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Just so it's clear.", "Operator", "We'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Good morning, folks, and congratulations on a strong quarter; and, Paul, thank you for the great visibility. Good stuff, as we like to say. Apologies if I missed this, but the tax rate was a little bit lower than we expected. I'm wondering if you could give us your updated thoughts there and if there's any updates regarding your longer term expectations?", "And just a follow-up on the capital allocation strategy, given current market demand for yield and is there an opportunity to kind of reevaluate share repurchases as opposed to more aggressive increase in your dividend, particularly given that as you just mentioned, your cash flow generation and predictability should improve after 2017? Thank you.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "Sure. I'll start with the tax rate. Yeah. The tax rate was a little bit lower, but you should note we did not change our guidance for the full year 2016. Tax is a fun thing. It's like I talked about how difficult it can be to calculate or predict the impact of FX on your gross margin. Similarly, trying to forecast your tax rate by quarter or by half year, the longer the period you're forecasting, the more accurate you're going to be. It is entirely likely and possible that we'll see some discrete items in the second half of our year that would cause our tax rate to be higher in the second half than it would be in the first.", "Generally, what I want to report is, we've made excellent progress in managing our tax position in light of the challenge that was thrown at us by the European Commission in January of this year; and we feel good heading into 2017 that we'll be able to achieve the effective tax rate that we've guided to on adjusted pre-tax of roughly 30%. So I'll leave it at that.", "And I think your other question there was around dividend versus share repurchase and how do you think about that perhaps as you move into 2017 with a more normalized cash flow coming out of the company. Let me say it's something that we will more likely address in detail later in the year.", "As I said, as we go through the process of looking at 2017 in some detail and we'll come back to you. Just state that we intend to return to shareholder's, through dividends or share repurchases, capital that's not needed to invest productively within our business or for M&A. I know a lot of you would \u2013 we've been out in meetings to say do you have a personal preference for share repurchase versus dividend. Let's leave that discussion for the fall.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to get a quick comment from the management team there, just where your barometer is right now on M&A and business development? Thanks very much.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "So we define that the first priority in terms of capital allocation is investing internally. We have a significant return on R&D, significant return on also the commercial activities. Second would be M&A. And, M&A, we consider a scenario that we will continue assessing any opportunity in the market and bringing to our company things that will enhance our core business or will complement our portfolio.", "We mentioned that diagnostics was an area that we entered some years ago, and we are committed to this area. And we will continue assessing and bringing additional opportunities to our diagnostic portfolio.", "Genetics is another area that we are already participating. We have seen that genetic is growing very fast in terms of genetic markets and also in terms of other areas that also will support the increase of productivity in livestock. Definitely, we'll be assessing the opportunities to participate in this broader market.", "And actually, we will consider how we can enhance our core portfolio in livestock, companion animal or aquaculture now that we are also participating in aquaculture. We use also business development to support our R&D efforts. And we will continue partnering with universities, also with biotech companies and other partners that will also support our R&D efforts.", "Operator", "The next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.", "Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Thank you for taking my question. It's Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. First of all, congratulation with the quarter's strong performance, EBIT and EPS. It's very nice and (53:20) that. So the question will be about the guidance and longer term margins. So back in November 2014, the company issued the long-term guidance for the first time given target 34% operating margin in 2017. So I'm wondering \u2013 and since that day, they just never re-issued the longer term guidance and did not expand to further years. So wondering if you're planning to provide longer term guidance in the future or it was more like one-time event in advance of restructuring a month later.", "And if there is no long-term guidance, how should we think about operating margins going forward? And if you can also specifically and whether there is a limit for operating margin growth and whether you can specifically quantify contribution from the product gross margin growth due to ongoing supply network rationalization initiative? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you. Let me make a short comment on the guidance that we provided back in November 2014; and then I will pass to Paul on how we see this margin evolving over time. So the first thing, almost three years ago or two years-and-a-half after we made this projection, we are confirming that in 2017 we'll be improving or reaching that 34% EBIT margin. And moving from at that time 25% that was projected for the end of 2014 to 34%, it's a significant improvement. And I think it's probably the confirmation of the predictability and the sustainability of our business. I think there are not too many companies that after three years they can maintain what I consider of course an aggressive target of improving our margin by 900 basis points. Now I will turn to Paul to provide some additional comments.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "Yeah, sure. And I want to be real clear. One, why did we provide long-term guidance? We provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S. and a pretty substantial change in our OpEx base. And in light of that, outside parties trying to forecast what we would look like in 2016 and then in 2017, you would've had no chance to really be able to be somewhat accurate. And so, we felt compelled to provide longer term guidance to let people determine through their own models whether they were in the neighborhood of what we were thinking or they had a difference of opinion.", "I think that was a one-time event. We, like most other companies, are reverting to having just \u2013 will revert to having just one year worth of guidance on the Street. So we'll provide the update, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks for 2017 later this year and then we'll have 2017 on the board. But I really want to focus on comments, Vlad, that you made around the 34% kind of operating EBIT margin \u2013 or excuse me, adjusted EBIT margin target that you referenced. Because I want to be really, really clear. We're not targeting a maximum operating margin. We're seeking to maximize our cash flow and grow it at a fast rate. If that's at a 33% margin, that's okay; if that's at a 36% margin, that's okay too, but it's not focusing solely on what is that margin and let's maximize that margin. We're looking at maximizing earnings as a proxy for cash flow and then growing it as quickly and for as long as we can at an attractive rate.", "Now, separately I believe you asked about is there an upper limit. One of the advantages of our company is that we have a wonderful global footprint where we have the scale to support that global footprint and generally \u2013 not completely, but generally, we have the ability to drive a lot more revenue on the infrastructure that we have deployed around the globe.", "So the answer is, yeah, we have the ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and thereby improve that operating margin. But what I don't want people to do is to focus on and say, a 33% or a 35% or \u2013 and look at that and say, well, gee, that's less than I thought. The goal is not to continue to drive that percentage; it's to maximize profit, cash flow, grow it and grow it fast and grow it for a long time. So I rambled a little bit there, but I hope I covered your question.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Sorry. I was just coming off mute there. Thanks very much. I was just hoping for a bit of a higher level framework for where you are with the restructuring and reorganizing of Zoetis. My sense is that you're about two-thirds of the way done of rationalizing SKUs and rationalizing people and your SG&A, et cetera. But, obviously, it's different for the cost of goods sold line than the SG&A line. So I was hoping that you could just provide a little bit higher level framework for how far you are along with the rationalization and restructuring by cost line? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "So thank you, Dave. Let me maybe provide a little bit more details on where I see we are in terms of our progress in terms of restructuring efforts. So I would say that all the efforts in terms of commercial and R&D are mostly completed. What we are still not fully finalized is related to some areas of G&A, mainly finance and IT, because this was also dependent on the implementation of SAP and we wanted to make sure that while we were transitioning to a different model \u2013 a more efficient model, we were ensuring the compliance of any type of finance, tax or IT elements. But we have no doubt that by the end of the year, all the programs will be in place and we'll start 2017 with a new base.", "In terms of SKUs, I said most of the work has been completed. And there are only some SKUs that we'll be eliminating from now until the end of the year; and this will be also with the introduction of new product that also will help us to minimize a negative impact of this last SKU rationalization.", "The other area that is still work in progress, but also progressing in line with expectations is the manufacturing changes. We exit the seven plants that we targeted. There is one plant that is still in progress, but five have been sold, one has been exited and the other one is in process. So in that area, things are progressing very well.", "There are some structural changes also in manufacturing that are a work in progress. And, again, so we plan to finalize this work by the end of the year and start 2017 with a full implemented plan for the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "This is Jonathan (01:02:05) on the line for Jami. Juan Ram\u00f3n, your discussion on R&D productivity is encouraging, but if possible we'd like to receive greater transparency on what that means. We're expecting 5% to 6% of operational growth for the next five years. Can you help us parse out what contribution comes from same product, same indication sales growth through price and volume? And based on your expectations for R&D productivity, what contribution is expected from new products and label expansions that come from this investment? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "The answer to this question in R&D is also answering how much are we allocating to new product innovation and how much we are allocating to lifecycle innovation. And we have actually buckets in our R&D expenses, one is related to regulatory expenses, about 15%; and then the other 85%, it's split between new product innovation and lifecycle innovation. So we are investing significantly to keep our current portfolio updated and competitive.", "So how much are we generating in terms of growth in-line compared to new products and price. So we describe that the animal health industry will be growing 5% to 6% in the next coming years. About half of these 5% to 6% will be related to price; and then in-line, we'll have half of the growth and new products have half of the remaining growth. The ability of Zoetis and other companies to grow faster than this 5% to 6% will come from new products.", "So, in 2016, excluding the impact of SKU rationalization, in the second quarter, this normalized operational growth is 9%. So how much came from the price? It was about 3% from price. New products also generated a significant part of this growth; and the in-line portfolio, it was growing volume by 1%. So the rest of the portfolio, APOQUEL generated 3 percentage points, other new products another 2 percentage points.", "So you see that the new products in the second quarter were generating about 500 basis points out of this 900 normalized organic operational growth. And that is what we also expect there for the future. For the future, we have communicated that we plan to grow in-line faster than market. In 2017, based in our guidance, we plan to grow faster than the market; and this faster growth will come from new product launches.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.", "Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for the questions. Just two quick ones here. First is on restructuring. To the extent that there are excess savings relative to your initial plan, should we think about those savings falling to the bottom line or are those likely to be reinvested in the business?", "And the second question was on China, you've had very strong growth for last couple of quarters. How much of this is near term in nature given some of the topics you described in the commentary versus sustainable step-up in growth in that part of the business? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Well, let me start with the question on how much we plan to circulate the excess of the savings into our profits and how much we plan to reinvest. And the answer will be, if we see opportunities of reinvestment, these extra savings that will generate future of growth and future profitable growth, then always we will decide to reinvestment in areas that will create future higher value for all our shareholders. And if we'll have these opportunities, then these excess savings will go to our profits. In China...", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "Hold on, before you flip to China. Again, I want to make this point and it was in my prepared remarks, but it's an important point. Efficiency initiative was all about eliminating non-productive expenses. Those are expenses that don't drive value for our company. So to the extent that we eliminate those, the returns are awesome. It's the first thing anyone should do is eliminate non-productive investments in the business.", "That gives us the ability to consider investments that will produce outside returns back in our business. And so, it's a very important point. And, by the way, when we boarded on that efficiency initiative, we targeted the $300 million and we believe we're going to be able to deliver savings beyond that.", "This sort of activity is a continuous process. It doesn't start and end when we announced the program last year. This is something that we will continue on and we look for ways to eliminate those non-productive expenses; and you can have the choice of either having enhanced near term profitability or we may see opportunities to redeploy those funds in more productive areas. So I wanted to make that point. Do you want to talk about China?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Yeah. In China, we see China as a country that will continue offering high opportunities for growth. We describe many times China as the largest producer of pork in the world. They have more than 600 million (pigs). Some of the statistics there are also indicating that they have 800 million of pigs; and still a lot of this production is not consolidated or is not highly sophisticated. And we expect that this will represent big opportunities for companies like Zoetis that can offer products that will increase the productivity and the quality and safety of the production in China.", "We also have seen opportunities in other species like cattle. The objective for us in cattle is to build a stronger portfolio, especially to build a stronger portfolio in vaccines. And the way that we are doing that is first trying to get approval for a portfolio that is already available in other markets, also in China. And second, to invest in R&D locally to produce specific vaccines for cattle, for swine and also for poultry.", "And this is a strategy that we are following, and we are convinced that China will continue growing, not only in livestock, we have seen a significant success in our portfolio in companion animal. We have now a portfolio, which is covering vaccines and covering some other products. We still have the opportunity in China to approve APOQUEL in the future \u2013 to approve SIMPARICA. This will take some time, but we are convinced that the potential growth of China will continue.", "There has been in the second quarter some additional growth coming from these extra acquisitions from channel distributors in anticipation of changes on the label. This is mainly administrative changes rather than a lot of work really to update the indications updates there (01:10:23). So you have seen that we wanted to ensure that the product will be continually available in the market without any kind of a reduction.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.", "I want to make one \u2013 it's one point, and Juan Ram\u00f3n covered this. But China, from a growth perspective, is attractive both on the companion animal front and the livestock front. And so that's an important point and I think he covered the structural elements that will lead to we believe good long-term growth opportunities.", "What's also interesting about China is how it affects one of our other key markets, which is Brazil. I think many of you may have seen recently an article that talked about the increase in exports of beef from Brazil to China. That's a good thing for us, because we're present in Brazil and that helps with the health of our customer base in Brazil. So China has a pretty interesting influence on our business, both for what we do there, but also on other segments of our company.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just really quickly, in terms of APOQUEL, I think you said that you're selling without restrictions since May. Just curious what the sales would have been this quarter if you'd have been able to sell without restrictions the entire time?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Well, it's always difficult to respond to these hypothetical questions, so I think definitely much higher than what we reported and not only in the U.S., but also in the other markets. So imagine that we have had APOQUEL fully available and fully launched in all markets from January 1, then definitely the revenues will be much higher than the $100 million at this point. How much, I think, is difficult to assess. But we are convinced that the opportunity is not only on having the product available without restrictions to all markets, to all customers, but the opportunity also to expand the use of APOQUEL not only to chronic, but also to acute indications.", "And this is where we're making a lot of efforts and we are considering different ways of communicating through veterinarians and also different ways to communicate that to pet owners to increase the awareness of the product and to make sure that the pet owners are also going to the clinics asking for APOQUEL for both chronic, but also acute indications.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on innovation, new products. Can you speak to the value proposition of IL-31 and monoclonal antibodies in the veterinary setting just in general? And on SIMPARICA, would the cat indication for SIMPARICA likely be a topical product and would it likely have the same sort of six-month age restriction similar to the canine chewable? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Let me start with the easiest answer on the cat. So definitely cats, in general, they don't like pills. And if you want to really to succeed in the cat market, you need to offer a topical indication; and this is what would be working in our R&D program really to bring this product into the market. So IL-31 still is a product that has been commercialized under a conditional license. It means that we still have very limited promotional activities for IL-31. So we want \u2013 or we focus during this period until full license to get the experience of using this product and also to develop all the data that will support the approval, the full license of IL-31.", "The feedback from the market so far is very positive. And, again, it's very complementary to APOQUEL. APOQUEL will be in both, acute and chronic. IL-31 being a product which is injectable, maybe we will position more in chronic than acute, but still will be opportunities for both indications.", "And as I said, in terms of efficacy, greater response from the veterinarians, mainly dermatologists and some experienced veterinarians and also great on safety. So I think all the indications are very positive to IL-31. And this will be, as I said, very complementary to our atopic dermatitis franchise (01:15:31) itching conditions. And we are very pleased with what we are doing.", "Last comment on SIMPARICA. So we continue to see SIMPARICA as a platform. So the active ingredient of SIMPARICA will be used for combination products, also for oral, for atopical; and we are convinced that this will be a significant product in our portfolio. And I think just to remind that in the cat business \u2013 or parasiticide, the cat market, we have REVOLUTION and REVOLUTION is performing very well. And we also expect that with the new lifecycle innovation that we are applying to SIMPARICA, the REVOLUTION penetration also will also be reinforced.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, for any closing remarks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much for joining us on this call.

[Operator Instructions]", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.", "John O'Connor", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 11, 2015. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you, John. Good morning to everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on the Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, review recent sponsor from the full portfolio and then with our outlook for 2015. 2014 was a year when we made significant progress in creating value. We are growing revenue faster than the market. We improved our margins despite absorbing additional costs required to operate as a fully independent company. We continue to advance our product portfolio through internal R&D initiatives. We communicated a 15% increase in our dividend and $500 million share repurchase program.", "This week, we announced that we completed the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health. We also continue to build a culture that delivers results, creates a high sense of ownership from our colleagues and focuses on generating short and long-term value for customers and shareholders. For the year, we delivered operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11%. Both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. Here are some details of 2014 revenue by species on an operational basis. In livestock, total revenue grew 9% to $3.1 billion. This reflects favorable market conditions for our producers and a strong performance of key Zoetis brands across affective vaccines and medicated feed additives.", "Livestock markets benefited from strong meat and milk prices as well as less expensive animal feed. These generated strong producer profits and in these market producers increased the medical treatment of animals to preserve their value. This has benefited many premium Zoetis brands.", "Cattle grew in revenues by 10% to $1.7 billion, with exceptional growth coming from beef cattle markets like the U.S., Brazil and Canada, as well as from our China business. In some key markets we see signs that the process of cattle expansion has begun. In the near-term, the high value of animals will continue to support our growth as producers have placed their premium on the health of their herds. Swine revenue grew 9% to $695 million with strong growth in many countries around the world. New and recent protein production such as ENGAIN, DRAXXIN 25, Relan N and our PCV2 franchise continue to grow in the market that experienced challenges due to disease outbreaks and trade restrictions. Poultry revenue grew 6% to $568 million with the strong growth coming from the U.S. and Latin America. Our growth portfolio in poultry, integrated coccidiosis management programs, namely ropic brought value to producers and led to increased customer penetration in key markets. ", "Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 4% to $1.6 billion. Across all regions we saw strong growth of key brands, including APOQUEL, ProHeart 6, CONVENIA, CERENIA and feline REVOLUTION. These gains were partially offset by declines in the vaccines and RIMADYL due to increased competition. For 2014, APOQUEL achieved sales of 34 million in an environment of constrained supply. For 2015, we are on track to increase supply in [etrin] and we expect APOQUEL revenues to be between $150 million and $175 million this year.", "Building on several years of solid revenue performance, we continue to deliver stronger revenue growth in 2014. We are also pleased that Zoetis continues to outpace the animal health industry. According to the latest data, for the 12 months ending Q3 2014, Zoetis revenue grew 5.5% while the animal health market grew by 4.6%. This growth includes the negative impact of currency movements. The steady interaction of our new products and investment in life cycle management contributed to steady revenue growth. In 2014, Zoetis achieved more than 180 product approvals, representing new products, new indications, new formulations, new combinations and geographic expansion of our portfolio.", "We recorded several important product milestones in recent months. This past November Zoetis submitted to the FDA a filing for zoromandis, which is the active ingredient of our new flea and tick oral parasiticide for dogs. And last month, we completed the filing for the same product in the EU and Canada. The global market for flea and tick parasiticides is about $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion. And launching a new product in this category is an opportunity with broad bacteria potential for Zoetis. Although bacteria for the animal health industry is generally prone to generating more than $100 million a year.", "Now let me turn to another milestone that illustrates continued integration from our R&D investment. We are pleased to announce that Zoetis has submitted a filing to the USDA for a novel antibody therapy to treat atopic dermatitis in dogs. Based on the USDA guidance, we are expecting a conditional license this year. Our progress in this therapeutic area further reinforces our industry leadership innovation. We have been active in building a platform in monoclonal antibodies that will have a broad application across species and medical conditions. The first potential product from this platform builds on our knowledge base in the area of canine dermatology. We are excited to bring another treatment option to veterinarians. In addition to novel products, Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse product portfolio through investments in product life cycle development. This past November, the FDA got a new label claim for DRAXXIN 25 in the U.S. to treat smaller cats. This follows the approval of DRAXXIN 25 label claims for pigs in July 2015. We also achieved additional label claims for the FOSTERA PRRS and vaccine for swine which is now licensed in the U.S. for reproductive protection. This product was first approved for respiratory protection in 2012.", "Zoetis PEDv vaccine continued to expand geographically, receiving permission to import and sell in Canada. Zoetis also launched the vaccine in China which broadens our range of vaccines in the world's largest swine market. As I mentioned, we just closed the purchase of Abbott Animal Health. This business is focused on the veterinary surgical market. It will strengthen our pain and sedation product portfolio and expand our diagnostic business. This acquisition is aligned with our value creation strategy to enhance our portfolio. We are adding leading brands and we believe Zoetis is gaining industry leading field force. I know at present we\u2019ll expand both the reach and penetration of the new portfolio.", "Zoetis also invests in animal health innovation through research partnerships. We recently announced that Zoetis was chosen to lead a research team to develop digital technologies for improved swine health and production efficiencies. Paul will address our 2015 guidance later in the call, but I would like to give you our perspective on the animal health industry on some factors that will drive Zoetis in 2015. The animal health industry is forecasted to grow in the 5% to 6% range operationally over the next five years, with growth in any given year above or below these rates.", "Looking to 2015, we expect operational revenue growth for Zoetis to keep pace with or outpace the animal health market. We also expect adjusted net income to grow faster than revenue as we leverage our business model and continue to focus on improving cost efficiencies. Now, our perspective by species; the outlook for companion animal is positive. Increased pet ownership and higher pet expense rates are driving the growth in emerging markets while specialty care is contributing to growth in more developed markets. For Zoetis, we must expect that the sales of APOQUEL will have a positive impact on growth in this segment.", "The outlook for livestock in 2015 is also positive. Producers will remain very profitable although at lower levels than in 2014. For Zoetis our premium products will remain an important factor to protect the health and value of livestock animals. And the line the ban for animal health products that remain strong, despite economic events such as lower growth in GDP, significant movements in the exchange rate, lower oil prices or international trade developments. We are monitoring the current business environment and all the exchange rates we don't see any significant impact on our business from these factors. As the past has shown again we'll have industry resilient to these and other microeconomic factors. Within the industry, Zoetis is highly diversify across many dimensions and this diversity has allow us to successfully manage through many market conditions in the past.", "The drivers of growth in animal health remain unchanged. Animal proteins and companionship from pets are basic needs, so we are confident about the future prospects and our ability to grow under volatile market conditions.", "So, I will now turn it over to Paul to talk about results for the fourth quarter, the year and guidance for 2015.", "Paul Herendeen", "Thank you, Juan Ramon, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I am going to review our performance compared with our full year 2014 guidance, provide some color on the fourth quarter results and update you on our full year guidance for 2015. I hope to do all that quickly so that we have plenty of time for Q&A, so here we go.", "Starting with full year 2014 results, the big stories here are revenue, revenue growth and revenue growth from a variety of sources. In 2014, we delivered 7% operational growth in revenue, the second consecutive year of 7% operational growth and second consecutive year of growth above the long-term industry trend. Pretty good, right? Even better, in the fourth quarter we delivered 9% operational growth versus Q4 of 2013, overcoming some significant FX headwinds to post 5% reported growth with positive operational trends that are heading right into 2015. Changes in FX rates reduced our Q4 reported growth rate, but we were able to overcome that and still put a solid growth number on the board. Good stuff indeed. Since mid-November FX rates have continued to move against us. I will help you think about the impact of FX rates on 2015 in a minute.", "Now for a look at our full-year performance versus guidance. As you can see on the Web cast slides, our revenue of 4.8 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. The operating growth of 7% was driven by 9% growth in livestock and 4% in companion animal. On a regional basis, the U.S. accounted for almost half of our growth, up 8% compared with 2013. CLAR accounted for about third of our operational growth, up 13%. APAC was about 11% of our operational growth, up 5%, and EuAfME accounted for about 8% of our operational growth, it was up 2% versus 2013. But in going to belt, and all growth rates are on an operational basis. ", "Continuing with 2014 performance compared with our guidance, our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 35.1%, a bit better than our guidance of 35.5%, and that's primarily due to the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A meanwhile, was 1.507 billion for the full year, approximately 27 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. There were a number of factors that contributed to the increase in SG&A above expectations.", "First, as we trended above our revenue forecast for the latter part of the quarter, we saw an increase in costs associated with higher revenue, such as sales incentive compensation and distribution expenses. We also authorized additional promotional spending in the quarter, spending that is expected to support revenue growth into 2015. Next, we accelerated some actions in Q4 that triggered additional G&A expense in the quarter, including for example, severance, software license expense and some additional business development expenses. ", "As successful as we have been in driving our top line, we are still a young Company, just finishing up our second year on our own. We have plenty of work remaining to build and fine-tune our G&A organizations and the systems needed to support our global business model. As that process continues, there will be opportunities to move forward and towards a more efficient cost structure. In other items, adjusted R&D expense came in at 393 million, in line with our full-year guidance. This continues to be an essential investment for both developing new products and managing the life cycle of the more than 300 product lines that provide us with our durable and growing revenue streams. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was almost 27%, and 18% in the fourth quarter. This reflected the full-year impact of the R&D tax credit which, you will recall, was not anticipated in our guidance. Also contributing to the lower-than-expected tax rate was a resolution of prior tax matters and changes in the mix of our earnings.", "It's important to know that the elements that drove the rate down below our and your expectations were not structural and we continue to expect that our tax rate in 2015 will be approximately 29%. As with our 2014 guidance, our tax rate guidance for 2015 does not include the potential benefit of an extension of the R&D tax credit. We exceeded the top end of our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 a share, posting $1.57 per share for the full-year. This was due to the strong revenues and the lower-than-expected tax rate, offset in part by increased spending in the fourth quarter ", "And finally, we exceeded our range on certain significant items and acquisition-related costs for 2014. This was the result of costs associated with certain shareholder activities and some changes associated with our global manufacturing organization. As a result, our reported diluted EPS came in at $1.16, the lower end of our guidance range.", "Now let me switch gears and dive a bit more into the fourth quarter results. You can see our income statement and adjusted income statement slides on our Web cast. Repeating from my opening remarks, fourth quarter revenue grew 9% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. And while nine minus five equals four, there is some rounding in there so the negative impact of currency movements on our growth rate was roughly 330 basis points. Our U.S. and CLAR segments demonstrated strong double-digit sales growth, leading the way for Zoetis , while the APAC segment grew modestly and EuAfME declined 1% on an operational basis. ", "On the last call I talked about the hazards of reading too much into any one quarter in isolation. EuAfME illustrates that clearly. In Q1 revenue was down 4% operationally and in Q2 revenue was up 4% operationally. In Q3 was up 12% operationally in Q4 it declined 1%. But for the year, operational growth for EuAfME was about 2%, broadly in line with the long-term expected growth rate for that segment. Moving to SG&A. Our adjusted SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 14% operationally due to the timing of promotional spending and other items that I called out earlier in my discussion of the full-year. Our adjusted R&D expense was up 4% operationally in the quarter. R&D, as I had noted before, can vary quarter to quarter due to the timing of clinical trials and other factors. For the full year we performed in line with our guidance. ", "And finally as I mentioned earlier, our catch rate in the quarter was 18%, due to a number of factors that got worked out in the fourth quarter. You also have a full set of regional tables and quarterly commentaries in the press release and Web cast slides. With that material available to you, let me just highlight a few takeaways on the revenue and profitability for each segment.", "Beginning with the U.S., fourth quarter revenue increased 14% driven by very strong livestock sales, which were up 19%, a truly stellar quarter for the largest segment of our business. The growth in livestock products, especially cattle in United States was based on higher demand for our premium products as producers continue to benefit from strong market conditions, some of which Juan Ramon just touched on.", "In companion animal products in the U.S., we generated growth of 7% driven by APOQUEL and other key brands, and despite continued competition for RIMADYL and competitive pressure in vaccines and parasiticides. Based on the U.S. segment strong sales and lower relative expense growth, their segment earnings increased by 20%. In Europe, Africa and Middle East, revenue decreased 1% on an operational basis compared with the fourth quarter 2013. This was the result of revenue increases in Southern Europe and Germany, driven by livestock as well as APOQUEL sales in the UK and Germany, with those increases more than offset by declines in other markets such as France and Russia. In France, we had anticipated some softness in the fourth quarter based on the fact that customers bought large amounts of anti-infectives in the third quarter ahead of more restrictive legislative changes that went into effect January 1st. The EuAfME segment earnings decreased by 4% operationally in the quarter, primarily due to declines in revenue and the timing of promotional spending.", "Moving to CLAR, which is our Canada and Latin American segment, we generated an increase of 16% operationally compared with the fourth quarter 2013. Brazil and Canada are the principal drivers in the", "CLAR region, given their relative size, and we saw growth in both livestock and companion animal products in these two countries. In Canada we saw significant cattle product sales due to strong market conditions for producers. Increased medicalization rates for companion animals in Brazil have been a driver of growth there as well. We also saw strong growth in Venezuela and other emerging markets in Central and South America. These high inflationary markets afford attractive growth opportunities that need to be carefully monitored. The CLAR segment earnings increased 20% on an operational basis, driven by the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses.", "Finally, in Asia Pacific we had an increase of 4% operationally compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of livestock products did well, particularly in Australia, Southeast Asia and across the board in emerging markets. A growing vaccine portfolio for swine and new parasiticide products continued to drive our performance there. Sales of companion animal products, however, declined 6% operationally, primarily due to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan that we talked about last quarter. The APAC segment operating earnings increased 6% operationally due to the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses.", "Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2015, which we first provided at our Investor Day in mid-November. We\u2019re updating certain elements of our full year guidance today to reflect three things. First, a factor over which we have no control and that\u2019s FX rates. We're adjusting our guidance based on the changes in foreign currency exchange rates from mid-November when we first reported our guidance for 2015 to reflect rates as of late January. In those roughly 70 days the U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all of the major currencies in which we transact. For emphasis and in round numbers, the dollar was up 9% versus the euro, 8% versus the Canadian dollar, 8% versus the Aussie dollar, 4% versus the British pound, 1% against the Japanese yen and against the Brazilian real it was flat. Those are our top six currencies.", "The movement in exchange rates since mid-November reduced our revenue expectations for full year 2015 by 125 million or 255 basis points, based on the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We now expect the full year impact of FX to be about 600 basis points or almost 300 million on our full year 2015 revenue as compared with our 2014 actual results. I want to repeat that for emphasis. Since mid-November the change in FX rate reduced our expectations for the full year 2015 by 255 basis points or 125 million, comparing our revised expectations for 2015 back to 2014 actual results, the changes in FX rates account for a 600 basis point reduction in our expected growth rate.", "So natural hedging from expenses denominated in foreign currencies reduces the dollar impact of the movements in FX at adjusted net income, where the negative impact of the change rate was roughly $30 million or roughly 360 basis points down from the midpoint of our initial guidance range. Something for you to be aware of, if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against our major currencies, that can put upward pressure on our effective tax rate. At this point, we are affirming our guidance for our tax rate at approximately 29%, not including the R&D tax credit. But for emphasis, I am going to repeat something I just said, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar could cause us to have to revisit that guidance. So that's another part we can monitor but don't control.", "The part we can control are our operating expenses in 2015. In addition to the expense reductions driven by the change in FX rates, we revised downward our range of expectations for SG&A expenses by an additional $35 million. This reflects targeted reductions in spending intended to help offset the FX impact on 2015 adjusted net income. Additionally we completed the acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health this week. With that done now, we will begin integration and expect a positive impact of approximately 75 million to revenue for our full-year 2015 results, an accretion of $0.01 per share to adjusted diluted EPS for the full-year 2015.", "Taking the FX rate changes and our reduction of expected SG&A into account as well as the Abbott transaction, our revised guidance calls for revenue in the range of 4.8 billion to 4.9 billion and results in our holding our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. The net $50 million reduction in the revenue range represents a roughly 125 million, or 2.5%, decrease driven by the change in the FX rates. ", "Meanwhile, the combination of the natural FX hedges inherent in our business and our targeted $35 million of OpEx reductions and the overall impact of Abbott, all those things combined enabled us to maintain our earlier adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2015. While we provided out guidance in November, we expressed growth targets based on the midpoints of our 2014 guidance ranges. With 2014 now final, it won't be freshening the growth rates implied by our guidance. ", "The more significant revenue base that we delivered in 2014 and our guidance as revised today to include Abbott and the expected expense reductions, we are expecting revenue growth on an operational basis in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% and growth of adjusted net income in the range of 11% to 16%. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, I will remind you of a comment I made at our Investor Day in November about the trajectory of our overall performance in 2015. ", "We still expect the year to start low and end high. A key driver of our growth in 2015 will be the additional supply of APOQUEL, but we will not see that supply increase until Q2. I also want to note that the revenue impact of the Abbott acquisition in Q1 is nominal, less than $5 million. And that there will be a negative impact on reported Q1 results based on the changes in FX rates since my comments in November.", "To sum up the quarter and the year, we continue with very strong revenue and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our global business model. The diversity of our business across species, product lines, geographies and therapeutic areas is one of our core strengths. Our global footprint enables us to overcome weaknesses in some regions and deliver consistent revenue and earnings growth. We demonstrated an ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional statements, while continue to absorb some of the impact and buildup of costs for our corporate functions. Foreign currency was a significant factor on our reported results in the quarter and for the year, and we have updated our full-year 2015 guidance based on the rates in effect as of late January 2015.", "We expect to deliver strong revenue and profit growth on an operational basis in 2015, 6.5% to 8.5% for revenue and 11% to 16% for adjusted net income. While the currency headwinds are expected to be a drag on our reported results and growth rates, we have taken steps to mitigate some of those impacts and will continue to pursue means of protecting and growing our adjusted net income throughout the year. ", "That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open the line for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from Louise Chen, with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. ", "Louise Chen", "My question here is since it's hard to find good companies to comp Zoetis's operating margin to, could you provide us a framework for thinking about where Zoetis's operating margin could improve to over the longer-term, beyond the 30% that you had forecasted at Investor Day?", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you, Louise, for the question. So we are convinced that now that we are finishing our work in standing up Zoetis on implementing new systems that will support our future operations, we can really identify opportunities for being more efficient in many lines of our P&L. That is something that we will continue in define business opportunities and seeing ways of improving our margins in the medium and long term.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei, with BMO Capital. Your line is open.", "Alex Arfaei", "Good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter. Juan Ramon, you mentioned strong market conditions and profitability in the livestock market. Clearly a key driver here, can you clarify on your outlook, when you say you expect this to continue in the near-term, what is the timeframe you put on that one-year or two-year? I want to get a sense of how long you think the cycle will last? And Paul, a follow-up if I may, you got a significant FX benefit on cost of goods sold this quarter. You lowered revenue guidance because of FX. I am just wondering why not raise gross margin guidance to reflect an FX benefit? Thank you.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you, Alex. In my comment I refer to the outlook was in for this year. So, we mentioned that in 2014, the conditions in livestock were very positive; the price of milk and meat was very high. Also there were low costs on feeding the animals. We expect that most of these conditions will remain in 2015, although we see maybe in some of the species like swine, maybe a lot of more attention in terms of price because of more supply of product. Since some of the rates that were affecting 2014, maybe we\u2019ll have a lower impact in \u201815 like the PEDv outbreak. So, we expect that the conditions will remain favorable, although for some of the species, maybe less profitable than in 2014.", "Paul Herendeen", "Thanks for the question, Alex. I'll take the question regarding the FX benefit that flowed through cost of goods sold. I want to point out that the timing of the way FX flows through our cost of goods sold is somewhat difficult to predict and also when you recognize it as we did in 2014 that does not necessarily translate into a continued benefit flowing through in 2015, point of fact that could very easily turn around on us on a reported basis.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll take our next question Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. My apologies, we actually have Mark Schoenebaum. Line is now open with Evercore ISI.", "Mark Schoenebaum", "Also my congratulations to Paul on a great job since you've taken the reins as CFO and to John on the IR front. Just a question on, I'm intrigued by your comments around your antibody platform. I haven't heard you talk about that before. You gave a little bit of detail during your prepared remarks, but I'd be interested in knowing more if possible, like how broad this program really is. Are you pursuing antibodies outside of companion animal dermatology or should we think of this is mainly a derm program? And the impact, if any that you think this antibody program will have on your P&L once commercial. Gross margins on the human health side tend to be a bit lower on antibodies than they are for small molecules. And then also of course on a CapEx -- long-term CapEx projection, sometimes building plants capable of producing large quantities of biologics can be expensive. I am wondering if that's already something that you've got your footprint or if these products are going to be big, we should be altering our models to some degree? Thanks a lot.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you, Mark. The monoclonal antibody that we mentioned today, it's a product that we neutralized the canine interleukin, which is also a key cytokine which is involved in the atopic dermatitis and also involved in sending the signs of itching to the brain of the animals. We have been investing in biopharmaceuticals for now several years. And we have been also introducing the products in these categories, not only on antibodies but on biopharmaceuticals. A good example is Improvac that was launched some years ago. And we also focus our attention to platforms that we also increase, the product portfolio that also will meet the demands of the market. We are very pleased that Zoetis is not only leading in pharmaceuticals, we have many examples like APOQUEL, that we've shown very strong leadership in that category, but also in vaccines.", "In 2014, we had the opportunity also to bring to the market a solution for an outbreak that it was a highly significant impact in the swine industry in the U.S., I am referring to the PEDv vaccine. And now we have used monoclonal antibody, we\u2019re also showing that also we are leading in biopharmaceuticals. We're very pleased also that our model, which is combining investment in innovation with investment in the protecting of our current portfolio is showing a high level of productivity and leading the industry in all different areas of innovation.", "Paul Herendeen", "Mark, it's Paul. First, thank you for the kind words. Yes, I had the very good fortune to join an outstanding team here. So, while I\u2019ll take the complement, I'd also say that it's a team game here. I also want to pile on a little bit on the R&D front, because from an investor perspective I kind of think of Zoetis is kind of like two-in-one. You have a large growing portfolio of existing business and we also have this robust R&D engine, that if it were on its own, would represent an attractive investment opportunity in its own right. So great question, thank you.", "Operator", "We will now take a question from Kevin Ellich, with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin Ellich", "Given your strong operational growth, I was just wondering if you'd break out the difference between volume and what type of pricing increases you are pushing through. And then could you maybe talk about the performance of some of your new products like ACTOGAIN and ENGAIN, and if you'd noticed any significant market share. ", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Paul will answer the first part of the question and then I will make some comments about the new product launches. ", "Paul Herendeen", "I will speak to the history because that's what we can do with respect to price and volume. Let's start with the quarter. We had total growth, as I said, operational growth 9%. Of that 9%, roughly 2% came from price and 7% came from volume. So strong in the quarter. Take that for the full-year, 7% operational growth. Again, 2% came from price and roughly 5% from volume. We got a lot more pricing leverage in emerging markets than in developed markets. I don't know if it's all that productive to go through the specifics of it, but I hope that, in general, answers your question. ", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Then back to your question on ACTOGAIN or ENGAIN. Both products performance are doing well and exceeding our initial projections. One of the factors that has been also impacting the higher revenue than expected, it was withdrawn off of one competitor product one year ago. So very pleased, with also the acceptance of our two products from customers, and these two products, ENGAIN is for the swine producers and ACTOGAIN for cattle producers. Both performing above expectations. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erin Wilson, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ", "Erin Wilson", "I was reading some of the literature on APOQUEL on the Web site and it continues to say that April's launch time frame or replenish supply. Will this be the same? Will it be fully ramped up that point? Or will there still be order limits in place over the course of the year? Is this all Incorporated into your guidance at this point? And then on new products, could you speak to the opportunity in diagnostics, any attraction you're seeing with your feline rapid assay? Is that an area you expect to build as to acquisitions? Do you anticipate any product launches in diagnostics overall? ", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you, Erin. On APOQUEL, definitely we expect that from April we'll increase significantly the production of the product, or the product availability to the veterinary market. We expect that from April we will be able to meet all the demands from the customers. And we expect also that through the year, demand will increase and then we will be able to supply all these demands with the product that will be available. As I said in my remarks, we are forecasting for 2015 revenues from $150 million to $175 million. And we are convinced that this will be a significant quality in our portfolio, and we are very pleased that all the constraints that we face in 2014 will be over in 2015 from April. ", "In terms of diagnostics, the diagnostics has been always -- since some years ago an area and where we have been also investing. We are convinced that this very complementary to our current portfolio and we also expect that with our internal efforts and also the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health, this will enhance our portfolio and definitely we will also consider any external opportunity and even further expressing our portfolio diagnostics. ", "Paul Herendeen", "It is Paul just a follow-up a little bit area. So the modelers out there and I know there are plenty, with respect to APOQUEL, we get through the first quarter and when we have supply we would expect a stair step for sales of APOQUEL and then with growth to follow. So I hope that provides a little better color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Kreger, with William Blair.", "John Kreger", "Juan Ramon you mentioned the new oral flea and tick product that has been filed. Do think that will be in a position to be fully launched by spring 2016 season? And then a quick second question I believe on Investor Day you talked about efforts to optimize your manufacturing. Program, which I know is big and complex around the world. Can you just give us an update on the timing for that broader effort? ", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "We expect [indiscernible] to be available sometime in 2016, which will depend on the approval from the FDA as well as the approval from EMA in Europe. And also in Canada also we expect approval. And we are working to make sure that the product will be available for the next parasitic campaign in April or around spring next year. Something that it will depend on FDA, but we expect to provide to FDA all the information needed to get this product approved on time. In terms of manufacturing, we mentioned during our Investor Day that from now until 2020, we expect an improvement in our cost by 200 basis points. And plans are moving ahead. And there is no any reason to think that we\u2019ll not be delivering on the objective that we have. Now also we mentioned that we have three phases of our plan. We are now on Phase 1, in this Phase 1, we\u2019ll be delivering these 200 basis points, then we\u2019ll go into the next phase that we\u2019ll be going to further analyze our plan network and then finally the third phase will be how we need to invest in manufacturing to achieve higher profitability or lower cost and also making sure that we have the technologies that will be needed to support our future revenues. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Chris Schott", "Just to two quick ones here. First following up an earlier pricing question, can you just elaborate a little more on the drivers of pricing particularly on the production side of the business? I guess specifically is there more opportunity to selectively raise or reset price when you see healthy market dynamics that we\u2019re seeing for your customers in the current environment? And second with just a broader business development kind of question, in area I think we all have a little bit less visibility into, but when you look at these Abbott type transaction that seem to make a lot of sense for Zoetis. How broad is an opportunity effect do you see on the business development front and given some of the anti-trust issues in the space are there realistically larger targets that Zoetis could pursue or should we really think of Abbott type transactions being the real focus here? Thanks very much.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "In terms of pricing, the approach that we have for both like livestock and companionable is to have steady and consistent price increases. We are not trying to get the opportunity of higher prices when the conditions are more favorable to livestock producers. And at the same time, we also apply pricing increases with these conditions as less favorable. So is -- and study that has been working very well and a study that has been extended to many markets around the world including emerging markets. And we had in 2014 very positive improvement in our prices in many of these emerging markets. In terms of really definitely Abbott was a great opportunity that it was meeting all the requirements that we have in terms of business development opportunities including the strategic field, including the synergies, revenues and cost, also the financial value and the anti-trust issues.", "Definitely we have significant market-share, you know that we have market-share which is close to 20% and these may have some intentions in terms of a larger acquisition. We\u2019ll consider any opportunity that is available in the market. We have a team that is aware of any kind of potential transaction that can be an opportunity for Zoetis and we will continue assessing these opportunities and as part of the evolution, we include any kind of anti-trust challenge, but we\u2019ll limit the value of the acquisition. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Jamie Rubin", "Sorry about that, can you hear me? Sorry about that guys. Had a little technical difficulty on my end. Juan Ramon, can you tell you what do you think is on the agenda as a new Board member? Is the agenda more related to margin improvement or is it business development? And as a follow-up, can you remind us of the agreement with Pfizer and how it would impact a potential sale of the company, is Zoetis too large for an acquisition by a competitor or would it have to be acquired by company with essentially no animal health presence? Thanks.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you, Jamie and let me start saying that we have very constructive dialogue with Pershing Square, since they became the largest shareholder in the fall. And they were -- they expressed interest in having a position in our board. And given that the Mr. Doyle has a lot of operational experience and again the position of Pershing Square in our company the Board agreed to incorporate him into our Board. So, what we -- all the Board will be working including Mr. Doyle and other members of the Board, increasing the value to our shareholders. And this value can come from many different ways. Including margins, growing revenues and any kind of potential transaction. And this is something that will be part of the discussions and maybe at this point may be stipulated is not creating any additional value to the discussion. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We can take our next question from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Jeff Holford", "Hi thanks very much for take my question. Going back to APOQUEL. Your 2015 guidance and commentary does suggest much higher peak sales and you get to full penetration to this so one could think of this product potentially adding 5% to 10% against your current base of revenues over the next couple of years. And I'm interested also around the level of margin seem a much higher margin product than the rest of the business overall. Could the potential bottom line impact from this product be a most double what it is that the top line? ", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you, Jeff. On APOQUEL we mentioned our peak sales are predicted between 200 million of 300 million and these based on the current knowledge of the market. Definitely we will be updating these peak sales based on what will be the reaction and the consumption of the public once the product it is available. In over quantity to assess what is the full potential of this compound. In general, we are not providing gross margin by products, but as you know we have gross margin in our Company of 65% and we rank margins depending on the categories. The highest margins are coming from companion animal followed by cattle, swine, and poultry. So you can imagine that companion animal much higher than the 65% average that we have at the Zoetis . Paul do you want to add any other comments?", "Paul Herendeen", "Sure, just one that is the increased sales of APOQUEL certainly help. Of course we do have a mix of our portfolio for example the guidance table you all saw the addition of the Abbott assets to our total 2015 expectations. The Abbott assets are gross profit dilutive. Now I know they are only updated guidance for 75 million of sales but we do have a portfolio so even when things like APOQUEL help, there are other parts of our portfolio that can help smooth or help \u2013 they tend to smooth that out back towards our expected 35.5% to 36% -ish range of revenues in for 2015. ", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi. Your line is open.", "Liav Abraham", "I am just looking back to cost efficiencies you mentioned this a couple of times during the call.", "Can you go into little but more detail about the opportunities that you see here in which cost categories and over what time frame? ", "Paul Herendeen", "It is Paul. I will take a stab at that and Juan Ramon may want to come in as well. Louise asked a question earlier on about margin expansion and I just want to point out that so far, we've done a pretty good job over the course of the last several years if you have looked at our reported operating margins going back to 2011 and up to \u201914 and it's been a nice progression from \u201918 to \u201921 to \u201924 to \u201925 and I was broadly by rolling the top line while having some expense discipline meaning holding the line on expenses. Now a wise man once said to me it\u2019s not all that impressive to grow into an expanding margin but I would say it may not be impressive but it is a good thing. That said, that what sets the stage. Even with respect to think about our 2015 we saw some headwinds in FX and we took some actions with respect to our operating expenses in order to be able to as best we could without impacting our business model reduce our expected operating expenses for 2015. The areas where we are most likely to have long-term opportunity are those areas that are away from revenue production and R&D and manufacturing. ", "And manufacturing would be more efficient to that process as we would hope to disclose to the market at some point in the future. In the area really is around those into recall enabling functions in G&A, we are still in the process of our standup. I know that is frustrating to a lot of people where we just really completed our second year on our own. We continue to have challenges in implementing systems and building out the infrastructure that will enable us to grow and control and manage what is a very complicated global business. As we make progress along the lines of the implementation for example of our global ERP package SAP, it will give us opportunity to be more efficient in our enabling functions. Now, we look at all types of expenses and I would say -- I do say constantly in investor meetings, we can always do better. So, we want to look at ways that we can deploy our capital within our business to the areas where we think we\u2019ll get the most bang for our buck, and to the extent that we are successful in doing that over the next several years, we expect that we can expand our operating margin potentially beyond what you would be -- or what would be implied by our current long-term guidance. And to refresh for everybody what we said on Investor Day was, you look out to 2015, '16, and '17 based on what you have in front of you, is you have a company that can grow from now roughly 25% operating margin and add 500 basis point so that by growing revenues and being disciplined with respect to expense. We see opportunities to be more efficient, that would survey be additive to that. Next question please.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) And we can take our next question from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Kathy Miner", "Just two quick follow-ups if I may. First on the stand up cost and ERP spending that you were just discussing. I believe the last time you had talked about those costs winding down the early part of 2016 can you give us an update on the timing? And second one on the oral flea and tick products, when it does come out, should we expected to be differentiated in any key ways from the products that are already out there? Thank you.", "Paul Herendeen", "The timing on that was that we would expect to be fully up on SAP by the end of the first quarter of 2016. So 2015 is a busy year for us in that regard and we\u2019ll still have some work in the early part of 2016, but we would expect to put that behind us in early 2016.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "And about Sarolaner that is our compound, the active ingredient of our new oral parasiticides for ticks and fleas, we are still working on the label. The label is not yet finalized and not approved. And we\u2019ll see how this is hit it's from competitors. And we know that there are already several competitors in the market, but as I said in my comments, it's a market of 2.5 billion to 3 billion. So it's a plenty of opportunities for Zoetis even in phase of several competitors. The other important point is that we have the access to the customers. We have a significant presence in all the markets, but the product will be available and the opportunity will be significant. And we are convinced that the vision of the model that we have which is our direct interaction with customers also will generate good revenues out of this product even with more or less differentiation in the market. Next question please.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll now take a follow-up from Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Jamie Rubin", "Hi, you may have missed my second part of my question if you could remind us of the agreement with Pfizer and how it impacted potential sales to the company? Thanks.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Yes, thank you, Jamie. While this agreement it's an agreement that its part of the tax matter agreement for which there are some restrictions until June 24. After this time there will be no restrictions but even with these potential restrictions until that date, there also maybe opportunities for company's considering transactions which are not affected by this tax matter agreement. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Reisinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "David Reisinger", "Thanks very much and congratulations to the team on the strong quarter. My question is on SG&A and I guess there are a few sub parts to it and it really relates to the cross currents. So, in the fourth quarter SG&A was above expectations, yet for 2015 SG&A will be below expectations. So with respect to the fourth quarter, were there any one-time or unusual items in the non-GAAP SG&A, Paul that will not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2015? And then second on the 2015 SG&A outlook coming down $35 million, does that include any sales force rationalization and if not, what are the areas of cuts?", "Paul Herendeen", "Yes sure, I\u2019ll start with the SG&A in Q4, David. There were as I articulated in my prepared remarks there are some of those cost that were directly related to increase revenue. There were some dates when we get to a certain point in revenue, where we have released additional promotional spending that occurred in Q4 that might not be likely to complete unless we are trending well above our expectations again in Q4 of 2015. So I wouldn\u2019t describe the items in there so much as one time. This is the ones that are within our adjusted SG&A. They were expenses that in large part were managed by us in the quarter, and reflect a robust revenue quarter for us and looking ahead to 2015. Thinking about the SG&A for 2015, full-year, we did reduce the range by some $35 million and no, it does not reflect any sort of a restructuring or anything. Evidence of that is if it had been a restructuring we probably would have called out in one-time cost and certain significant items restructuring charge. This was -- what I will call a normal course of business, looking at 2015, looking at where we are relative to where we want to be in us taking actions around categories that we do not think will influence that top line. So by definition, away from revenue generation mainly in enabling type functions. I hope that answers the question. Next question please.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. At this time I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Juan Ramon for any additional or closing remarks.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you for joining us today. On our fourth quarter results total year for 2014. And our guidance for this year. So thank you for joining us.", "Operator", "Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Hosting the call today from Zoetis is Vice President of Investor Relations, Dina Fede.", "The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.", "In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Dina Fede, Vice President of Investor Relations. Dina, you may begin.", "Dina Fede", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ram\u00f3n and Rick will provide an overview of results, and then we'll open the call for your questions.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Zoetis website. We're also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. And a PDF version of the slides representing and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of the certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our 2012 10-K and our 2013 10-Qs.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, such as the recurring costs of becoming a stand-alone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 5, 2013.", "We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "We believe that providing these views of our performance, which are used by management to evaluate the business, will enhance your understanding of our financial results.", "Finally, let me remind you that since Zoetis was not a stand-alone company in 2012, our financial statements covering periods prior to the IPO were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Pfizer. These financials include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs that were attributed to the animal health business of Pfizer. As such, the combined financial statements for these periods do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a stand-alone public company, which can make comparisons to the prior periods difficult in certain instances.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Dina, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I will walk you through the continued progress Zoetis is making and share my perspective on some of the trends impacting our company, our industry and the customers that we serve.", "Let me start saying that I am very pleased with our third quarter results, 9% operational revenue growth and diluted adjusted EPS of $0.34. Once again, our diverse portfolio of products across geographies, species and therapeutic areas was a key factor in delivering results during this quarter. This performance also illustrates the value of the contribution that Zoetis colleagues around the world bring, and the strong and meaningful partnership we have developed with our customers.", "I will outline the highlights of our business segment performance, and then Rick Passov will provide some additional comments on our financial results.", "At the segment level, Zoetis continues to see the benefits of our business model, and we saw growth across all regions. Some of this growth reflects more normalized weather patterns for our customers in North America, continued market acceptance of our products, new launches such as vaccines for swine and poultry in certain countries, the continued focus of pet owners on the health of their animals and our focus on emerging markets. These more than offset the challenges in some of our markets related to competitive market dynamics, changing regulatory environments and economic conditions.", "Now for a few highlights of this performance. In Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth in markets like India, China, Thailand and New Zealand. These were somewhat offset by the ongoing impact of drought conditions and livestock problems Australia. On a year-to-date basis, the APAC region grew 5% operationally versus total company growth of 6%. However, we expect the region to deliver growth for the year largely in line with the total company growth rate, as conditions in these diverse markets are expected to improve.", "In Canada, Latin America, we saw growth in our 2 largest markets in the region, Brazil and Canada, as well as Venezuela. In Brazil, we saw strong growth in poultry while cattle sales were relatively flat.", "In Europe/Africa/Middle East, we delivered strong growth from livestock products in emerging markets such as Russia, Turkey and South Africa, and growth in companion animals business, mainly in Western Europe.", "And finally, in the U.S., we saw growth across all segments of our business. In particular, cattle products experienced significant growth compared to the same quarter last year, which was hurt by the severe drought conditions. Although cattle placement declined in the third quarter compared to 1 year ago, September trends were positive, and the market anticipated favorable trends to continue into October. The expectations of increased cattle movement have resulted in higher demand for animal health products in the third quarter.", "From a global perspective, livestock sales grew by 8% operationally and companion animal sales grew by 11% operationally. Again, through these results, we see the strength of our portfolio, scale, global presence and business model. Weather conditions continue to improve for many of our livestock producers. This is, of course, positive news for those who have been managing their businesses in often very difficult circumstances during the last 12 months. But challenges remain for our customers in Australia, where the drought is having a significant impact.", "In the third quarter, we also saw continued disease outbreaks in both the livestock and the companion animal sectors. These outbreaks can have a serious impact on the health of animals, and in the case of livestock producers, in their profitability.", "You may recall on our last earnings call that I talked about the outbreak of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or PEDv. The virus typically affects pigs in the nursery and it has sadly continued to spread. The disease has been reported in at least 17 U.S. states. There is no vaccine at this time, and producers and veterinarians remain on high alert. Of note, researchers of the U.S. Department of Agriculture say that PEDv does not pose a threat to human health or to food safety. We are closely monitoring the situation and its impact on our customers. We do not currently expect this outbreak to materially impact our 2013 financial results.", "Zoetis continues to support the University of Minnesota with the development of a rapid diagnostic test for the disease, and collaborating with the university is just one way in which Zoetis is investing in finding a solution to combat the virus.", "Also, in the Asia Pacific region, we have partnered with authorities in Taiwan to respond to their first confirmed cases of rabies in more than 50 years in the country. We work with the Taiwanese government to import 700,000 doses of rabies vaccine, Defensor 3, and this enabled the government to implement its emergency vaccination program and mitigate the spread of the disease to animals and humans in the country.", "This quarter's performance has been achieved while we continue our efforts to stand up our company and to build out our infrastructure. This includes, as examples, opening Zoetis offices in a number of European locations and establishing our own financial shared services teams. This and other projects are all focused on enabling Zoetis to operate independently.", "We continue to partner with regulatory agencies around the world to bring new, innovative animal health products to the market, as well as new formulations and indications, combination of products and geographical extension of our existing portfolio.", "During this quarter, and of particular note, we saw that APOQUEL has now received approval from the European Commission. Total market approval for this product include the United States, New Zealand and 27 countries in Europe.", "APOQUEL is indicated for the treatment of certain types of pruritus in dogs at least 12 months of age. In the U.S. and EU, roughly 8.2 million and 5.2 million dogs, respectively, are treated for itchiness. There are a number of factors that can trigger an itchy reaction such as infections, dermatitis and parasites. The length of treatment using current products varies from days or weeks for acute cases of each, to months for chronic allergic dogs. Options to address itchiness in dogs, including the type and length of any product prescribed or suggested, will vary based on diagnostics and the treatment philosophy of the veterinarians and the preference of the pet owners.", "We also recently received approval in the U.S. of 2 generic formulations of ractopamine, a beta-agonist. The 2 products will be marketed as ENGAIN, which has been approved for swine, and ACTOGAIN, which has been approved for cattle. We currently expect these products to launch sometime in 2014. As you may know, ractopamine is a feed additive that helps cattle and pigs direct their food energy towards producing high-quality lean meat rather than fat. The product has been safely used for more than a decade and widely adopted in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Brazil.", "We are excited to bring these products to Zoetis, and most importantly, to our customers.", "In addition, through our approach to managing our existing brands, we are actively pursuing claims extensions for launching existing products into new geographies. We receive multiple approvals around the world each quarter. This enables to enhance our brand portfolio of products, and a few examples from this third quarter include BOVI-SHIELD GOLD ONE SHOT, which has been approved in Canada for use in cattle. Canada decisions builds on the recent approval for this combination of product received from the U.S. in the second quarter.", "FACTREL has been approved for use in the U.S. with LUTALYSE for fixed-time artificial insemination of dairy cattle. Its approval allows producers to improve the reproductive performance of their herds.", "Also in the U.S., we saw approval of EXCENEL RTU EZ for cattle and swine. These are the formulation of one of our existing products, EXCENEL RTU, with an improved delivery method making the product even easier to use. We will launch this enhanced product to U.S. cattle and pork markets in the fourth quarter.", "All these activities enable us to deliver our innovation and capabilities to both existing and new markets, and leverage our global presence and scale to benefit customers around the world.", "I would now like to mention another topic we have discussed in the past. We are expecting the U.S. FDA to issue final guidance 2013, which will establish the procedures for eliminating growth promotion indication for medically important antibiotics. Zoetis supports the U.S. FDA's efforts, and we are committed to working with our veterinary and livestock producer customers through this process. As we said previously, we don't expect this to have a material impact on our future financial results.", "With 3 quarters now reported in our first year, I am very pleased with how we are meeting our commitments to customers, delivering financial results and setting a solid foundation for our future. External benchmark data shows that during the first half of the year, Zoetis revenue grew faster than the market. Data for our current quarter is not yet available. I continue to see great potential in our business and our industry over the coming years, and look forward to continuing our discussions.", "And with that, let me thank you for your attention and your interest in Zoetis. And I will now hand the call over to Rick and ask him to walk us through the third quarter financial results and guidance for 2013. Rick?", "Richard A. Passov", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. I'll now provide some additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.", "Revenue was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year, including a negative impact of 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. Excluding this FX impact, revenue grew 9%, and I will discuss the key drivers in a minute.", "Turning to net income. Reported net income of $131 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.26 decreased by 19%, primarily driven by certain stand-up costs associated with our full separation from Pfizer. On an adjusted basis, net income of $172 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 showed an increase of approximately 12% and 10%, respectively. The adjusted net income excludes the impact of $8 million of purchase accounting adjustments and $33 million of certain significant items, including stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer.", "Turning now to our adjusted net income statement. Revenue was up 9% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As Juan Ram\u00f3n indicated, our operational increase was supported by higher sales across all species. Companion animal growth was driven primarily by higher sales in large developed markets, while livestock growth benefited from more normalized weather patterns in North America and good growth in many emerging markets around the world. However, we continue to see a negative impact on cattle revenues in Australia from ongoing drought conditions, while cattle revenues in Brazil are being impacted by increased local competition.", "Adjusted cost of sales was approximately 34.7% of revenues versus 35 -- excuse me, 34.5% in the year ago quarter. This reflects the impact of product mix and faster growth in emerging markets, partly offset by the benefit of relatively higher growth in the U.S.", "Adjusted SG&A increased 9% operationally, in line with our revenue growth, while adjusted R&D expense decreased 1% operationally. Adjusted net interest expense was $29 million in the third quarter of 2013, reflecting our debt issuance in January of this year.", "Adjusted other income and deductions in the quarter decreased to income of $7 million in the third quarter of 2013 from income of $10 million in the third quarter of 2012.", "Our effective adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 29.5%. And again, our adjusted net income increased approximately 12% to $172 million for the third quarter or 16% operational growth.", "Now on to our segment results, which I will discuss on an operational basis. Segment earnings are pretax numbers and are reported on an adjusted basis. Beginning with the U.S. third quarter revenue was $495 million, an increase of 10%.", "Sales of livestock products grew 11%, driven by cattle, poultry and swine. Results reflected increased volumes and the benefit of price increases taken in the first quarter. We saw strong growth in sales of cattle products, the largest contributor to livestock growth, which benefited from an unusually weak year-ago quarter, when the impact of the drought was most evident.", "Sales of poultry products were driven -- were strong as well, primarily due to medical feed additives.", "Swine products increased, driven primarily by continued customer acceptance of new products.", "Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 10%. This increase was driven by sales of small animal products, reflecting the benefit of price increases taken in the first quarter, as well as the positive impact of promotional efforts.", "And equine sales were relatively flat.", "U.S. segment earnings increased 23% due to strong revenue growth, favorable product mix and timing of certain promotional spend.", "Now turning to our Europe/Africa/Middle East region. In EuAfME, third quarter revenue was $270 million, an increase of 9% operationally.", "Sales of livestock products grew 7% operationally. This reflects an increase in cattle product sales across many emerging markets, tempered by a continued decline in sales of cattle products in Western Europe due to challenging market dynamics and the competitive environment.", "Sales of swine products continue to benefit from customer acceptance of a new vaccine across many markets.", "Sales of companion animal products grew 15% operationally and benefited again this quarter from increased sales associated with third-party manufacturing agreements. Excluding these sales, companion animal product sales grew approximately 5% operationally. This growth was driven by sales of anti-infective and parasiticide products for small animals.", "EuAfME segments earnings increased 1% operationally. The benefit of increased revenue was largely offset by the unfavorable impact of product and geographic mix. In addition, results in the year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by certain adjustments, which can make comparisons to prior periods difficult.", "Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR. Third quarter revenue was approximately $171 million, an increase of 9% operationally.", "Sales of livestock products grew 6% operationally, driven by sales of cattle and poultry products. Cattle product sales increased primarily due to growth in Venezuela, Canada and Mexico, while sales in Brazil were relatively flat, reflecting the impact of increased local competition.", "Sales of poultry products were driven by medical feed additives, primarily in Brazil.", "Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 19% operationally, largely due to growth in Canada based on the timing of the parasiticide season, our ability to maintain market share gained from a competitor supply issue in the year ago quarter and the timing of price increases. In addition, we continue to benefit from increased demand in Brazil.", "CLAR segment earnings increased 24% operationally. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth and favorable product mix. In addition, results in the year ago quarter were unfavorably impacted by certain adjustments, which can make comparisons to prior periods difficult.", "In APAC, third quarter sales were $167 million, an increase of 7% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 8% operationally, driven primarily by growth in emerging markets across swine, poultry and cattle. Increased swine product sales came from continued customer acceptance of new products in China.", "Poultry product sales benefited from ongoing customer acceptance of products in emerging markets and the resolution of a license registration issue in India.", "Cattle product sales growth was primarily driven by performance in New Zealand, partially offset by the impact of prolonged drought conditions in Australia.", "Sales of companion animal products grew 3% operationally, driven by increases in developed markets, such as Japan and Taiwan, and in emerging markets such as China. This growth was partially offset by declines in Australia due to increased competition.", "APAC segment operating earnings increased 3% operationally. This reflects unfavorable product and geographic mix and increased investment in promotional activities.", "Now let us turn to guidance for full year 2013. We have reported 3 quarters in the fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year financial guidance. As a result, we are narrowing our adjusted financial guidance for the full year 2013 to reflect our performance year-to-date.", "We now expect adjusted EPS of between $1.38 and $1.42 per share. In addition, we remain on track to the guidance we gave for non-recurring costs related to stand-up activities and the remaining integration costs associated with prior acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have booked $147 million for these non-recurring costs. These costs, along with purchase accounting adjustments, are excluded from our adjusted numbers.", "Subsequent to the third quarter, we have taken the following decisions that will result in onetime charges of up to approximately $20 million and which will be reflected in fourth quarter reported results. We recently integrated research and development for our branded generics business into our global R&D operations. We are exiting assets associated with manufacturing intermediate ingredients for certain products that we believe we can source more effectively from third parties. And finally, we have decided to divest certain assets in our aquaculture business. Including all of these items, which will be excluded from our adjusted numbers, we now expect the range of total non-recurring costs to be between $200 million and $240 million for fiscal 2013.", "So including the impact of these items, our reported diluted EPS for the full year is now expected to be between $0.98 and $1.02 per share.", "Finally, we continue to evaluate opportunities to improve our operations and assess the carrying value of certain assets based on changes in events and circumstances. At this point, I don't expect any ongoing reviews to materially impact the range for non-recurring costs that we are providing with this update.", "Our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we'll open the line for questions. Dina?", "Dina Fede", "Thank you, Rick. Operator, we're ready for our first question, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.", "Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just had a couple parted question here. So we saw a strong recovery in the U.S. kind of livestock and cattle market this quarter. How do you see the market growth playing out from here as we look out the next year or 2, as grain prices have normalized? I guess, what are you hearing from your customers on herd recovery? I'm just trying to understand how that dynamic plays out as we annualize these drought comps. And the second question was on expenses. We saw a step-up in SG&A this quarter. Is this a sign of higher spend going forward? Or are we just seeing some promotional spend as this livestock market recovers?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Chris. Let me answer the questions and maybe Rick also will add some comments. On the U.S. livestock, a significant portion of the U.S. is related to cattle. We saw this quarter that cattle performed extremely well. But again, compared to last year, where the drought conditions were affecting the business significantly, we expect the last part of the year normalized in terms of movement of animals to the feedlot. It is true that we have fewer animals than last year. We expect also that the cattle business will take 2 to 3 years to rebuild the herd. And this is what we had been already communicating, that in cattle it takes longer to rebuild the herd, while in swine and poultry we have seen that this recovery has been much faster. And this is also reflected in our revenues, because in the first 9 months, poultry and swine in the U.S. have performed very well. In terms of expenses as SG&A, so we had in the last quarter the delay on the parasiticide season. And also related to that, we decided also to postpone some of the promotional activities until the time of the parasiticide season. This occurred in the third quarter, and the third quarter has been impacted in terms of promotional expenses that were mostly delayed from the second quarter. In terms of expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance. And you can see that we have also lowered the upper range of our guidance on expenses, SG&A as well as R&D. Rick, you want to add any other comment?", "Richard A. Passov", "The only thing I would add is that if I look at total operating expense in Q3 versus Q3 of last year, we're slightly better. If I look at total operating expense year-to-date through this year versus last year, we're more than slightly better. Also year-to-date, we're under where we expect to be for the full year and that gives us the ability to continue to support promotional spend into the fourth quarter. And the last thing that I would say is that, in addition to the timing of promotional spend in the third quarter that Juan Ram\u00f3n described, there is also the increase in enabling functions spend, which is higher, Q3 versus Q2, than it has been in the prior quarters. So when I look at total SG&A, this quarter being basically where it was last quarter and better year-to-date, including the enabling functions spend, we're definitely on track to where we expect to be.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Operationally, in terms of revenues, we are growing year-to-date by 6%, while expenses are growing year-to-date only by 2%.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I guess, first off, on the new products that you talked about, Juan Ram\u00f3n, APOQUEL, EXCENEL and the beta-agonist, just wondering if you could give us some color on how you expect these products to ramp into 2014? And then also, we saw a small acquisition this quarter -- or after the quarter closed in October, Advanced Food Technologies. Wondering if you could give us some more color on the size of that deal, and what else you guys are looking at on the M&A front?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "On APOQUEL. So definitely, APOQUEL, it's a product that is expected by the market. It's covering unmet need to treat dogs suffering from itchiness. The current treatments are corticosteroids and also some other products that are available to the veterinarians. Also, in some cases, the veterinarians are also using many different alternatives, different pharmaceuticals to treat these dogs. We expect that in 2014, when the product will be launched, the adoption will be gradual, switching current treatment to APOQUEL. We are convinced that, in the long term, APOQUEL will be an important product in our portfolio. In terms of beta-agonist, so we are also entering into this market with 2 generic formulations: one for swine, the other one for cattle. The swine product will be launched in the first quarter. The cattle product will be launched in the second half of 2014. Again, so it's something that we think that will be an opportunity for Zoetis to incorporate 2 products which are used by livestock producers in the U.S, and also will fill a gap that we have in our portfolio, that we'll be able really to offer to our customers a larger range of products and solutions to treat and to prevent diseases. In terms of the acquisition of -- that we also announced in this quarter, it's a small company. Definitely, it is small, but it's following the strategy that we already started some years ago to really complement our portfolio, our core business, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, with complementary spaces. And we entered in devices, in poultry devices, with the acquisition of Embrex some years ago. We also have now in diagnostics with the acquisition of Synbiotics. We're also offering services to our customers, and these food safety products also will complement our portfolio. And we will enter in a space that it's growing importance because its consumers and also governments are demanding higher food safety, and we think that we can bring our commercial strength and also our expertise in R&D to really leverage this acquisition. That, again, is a small one and we have some revenues in 2014, but not significant earnings.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim.", "Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "My question was if you had any thoughts on some of your competitors who have been talking about spinning out or selling their animal health businesses. And I was just wondering how that may affect you, or what do you think about that?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Well, I must say that -- thank you for the question, Louise. We are focused on making sure that we are meeting our objectives in 2013 and at the same time that we are standing up Zoetis. As you can imagine, this has significant complexity that we need to manage, but I think we are showing that we are able to manage the complexity and delivering strong results. I think it's something that -- speculating on other companies, I think, is probably something that we should not really enter, but continued focus on delivering the value to our customers and our shareholders.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.", "Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just -- maybe just building on the last question. If Novartis or Merck were to decide to part with their animal health company, would that something you guys would consider bidding on? Or should we, as investors and analysts, really think about that as outside the scope of your capabilities right now, given some balance sheet constraints, as well as maybe some F -- perhaps FTC issues? And then given the SG&A in the quarter, over the long term, Rick, is it reasonable that investors should still expect the SG&A, as a percent of revenues, to decline over the long term?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Well, I would -- thank you, Mark, for the question. And maybe I will repeat that it's -- this is something that other companies are really considering a strategic option for their animal health business. We are convinced that we have the critical mass and also the diversity in terms of our geographies, species and therapeutic areas to be successful. Definitely considering M&A will be part of our model. But at this point it's something that we need to really to ensure that we are meeting our commitments in 2013 and '14. And in terms of M&A, I would say that, at this point, we are focused on areas that will be smaller, will be complementary, filling gaps in our portfolio or adding some complementary spaces, like the acquisition that we just announced. In terms of SG&A, maybe, Rick, you want to answer this question?", "Richard A. Passov", "Sure. So Mark, as you can see, in 2013, there's very good operating leverage in the business. In 2014, as we've spoken about in the past, we're going to continue to build out our own infrastructure, look across all of our processes and gain operating efficiencies, and we think that continues to drive operating leverage. And beyond that, I'm not going to make a long-term prediction. But I do think that the leverage that we see in '13 can be sustained, especially as we get into 2014, to some degree.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.", "Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "The question's around the initiation of your eCommerce business earlier in the spring. You made reference to a number of customers that had signed up and a number of customers that had used it, and I wondered if we could get an update? And then on the same thought, Rick, is there some reason that, that, certainly in the U.S., I recognize, can -- or is it already demonstrating some improvement in overall operating margin?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "In terms of the eCommerce, it's true that I provided some details on the last call. I don't have in front of me what is the number of customers that are already signed off on this eCommerce. What I had is the feedback of the U.S. team has been positive, and the feedback from our customers is also very positive. So I think it's something that we are adding to the way that we are interacting with customers, and we see as additional way of really providing support and services to our customers. In terms of the improvement in operating margin, you mean for the U.S. or in general. I think it's -- definitely, we are committed and is something that we mentioned many times that we are committed to grow our revenues in line or faster than the market. And we are also committed to improve margin faster than revenues. And we'll achieve that over time by the right actions in terms of gross margin, the cost of the products sold, the right strategy in terms of pricing and control on our operating expenses. And we are convinced that this is something that we'll be able to deliver in the future.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And this is Erin filling in for Willoughby this morning. First question on SG&A expense again. So should we think about some of your cost structure initiatives as essentially being pushed out into 2014? Can you discuss those dynamics, just flesh it out a little bit? And then my second question is in U.S. companion animal. It was also very strong. Are these trends sustainable going forward? And how should we think about the underlying utilization trends for the companion animal segment, in the U.S. in particular?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "We'll have the opportunity to discuss about our 2014 guidance next year. We don't see, at this point, any reason why what we have been describing in the past will change, and we are confident that we will continue with discipline in terms of SG&A and having the right level of investment to support our revenue growth aspirations. The U.S. companion animal business, as you said, it's doing very well in the U.S., and we are growing in all the different categories. Definitely, with the launch of APOQUEL, we expect also to generate growth in the future in 2014. And we think that the level of our business model, which is, as we said many times, direct interaction with customers; deliver innovation; at the same time that we deliver innovation, also making sure that we protect our existing portfolio with new formulations or combination of products, new combination of vaccines; and also the quality of our manufacturing are very strong elements really to sustain our growth in the companion animal business in the U.S., as well as in other markets.", "Richard A. Passov", "Erin, I'll just add a little bit to the comment that you made on SG&A. There's nothing kind of off-track or that's changing in terms of how we see spend evolving this year. In the guidance that we're giving you now, we are actually narrowing our full year guidance for SG&A, as well as R&D. So with respect to our expectations as we gave them to you in April, we're performing at or better than how we expected there. Quarter-to-quarter, there are variations in spend, partly, as we had said earlier, in Q1 and Q2, the pace of spend on the enabling functions was somewhat slower than we expected, and then also, as Juan Ram\u00f3n pointed out, higher promotional spend in the second half. But the guidance that we're giving you now, if I can point out again, is narrowed versus April. That includes our expectations of spend for the full year. And as I pencil through that guidance, I get to the performance, the operating leverage that we expected and therefore, the kind of expense control that we believe exists in the model.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.", "Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And Rick, I don't mean to beat a dead horse. I think the surprise this quarter was the nice top line beat, which didn't translate into an earnings meet. And if I look out at models, we are assuming improvements in operating margins. And I'm just, again, trying to understand if there's still significant juice enough just by achieving synergies or efficiencies as a stand-alone company, or eventually will we have to see further consolidation with, specifically, your business model in order to see improvements in operating margins going forward, sort of beyond 2014, if you could kind of speak broadly?", "Richard A. Passov", "Well, again, I mean, I think I would just, again, reaffirm the guidance that we're giving you. The way I look at this is at the beginning of this year, we set out to achieve the operating leverage that we've discussed, and we're basically on track to do that. And the narrowing of our total year spend, I think, reinforces that. And again, quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be variations in spend to either support various promotional campaigns, or in this particular quarter, the growth in enabling functions year-over-year. And when I include the total cost of supporting our own infrastructure and compare the Q3 of '13 to the Q3 of 2012, and basically were on top of each other, I think, in my view, that's actually a good sign coupled with reaffirming the full year guidance. So I don't -- I wouldn't read anything into this particular quarter in terms of changing what we believe the operating model is for this business, this year or going forward.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "And Jami, let me add to what I mentioned on the previous question, that our financial model for the next 5 years is to grow in line or faster than the market. The market is expecting to grow compound annual growth of 6%. We expect our margins growing faster than revenues and there will be, with the right control of expenses, that we expect to grow in line with inflation and also control on our cost of goods and also the pricing strategy. This will result in really improving long term, in this 5 years of period, improvement in terms of our margins. We don't need, at this point, any further consolidation. We have already the critical mass that we need. And that's really, with the critical mass and with the investment that we made already in most of the markets that we operate, we are confident that this will generate synergies in the future.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.", "David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So with respect to the M&A outlook, it seems, Juan Ram\u00f3n, that you downplayed the opportunity to do larger acquisitions. But as you think about the business and creating shareholder value and the opportunity to boost the value of Zoetis' stock, could you just talk about whether you would consider stepping up the company's market share through a larger transaction to take the market share globally from, let's say, 20% currently to maybe 25% or 30%? I would think that, that would boost the value of your share significantly, even if you were to issue equity to do such a deal. So I guess, maybe my 2 questions are: Why shouldn't that be an opportunity? And second, how do you see M&A building shareholder value if you won't consider medium- to large-sized deals?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Dave. And I think, as you can imagine, so nothing should be excluded, at least from the internal analysis of exploring opportunities. What are the conditions that we need really to meet for any acquisition, small, medium or a large? A strategic fit and the financials really are supporting the investment. The experience that we had when we acquired Fort Dodge, at the time, we were a company of $2 billion, Fort Dodge was a company of $1 million -- $1 billion. We divested 10% of the combined companies, a little bit more than 10% because of antitrust issues. Now with a market share of 20%, you can imagine that the challenge in terms of antitrust will be even higher. And this is something that we need also to include in any analysis, because we know that paying a premium price for integration[ph] and divesting at a lower price because of FTC regulations or European Union regulations will be probably not the right decision for our shareholders. We'll continue analyzing, exploring and definitely, if it makes sense, so then we'll make that call.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Just 2 quick follow-ups. First, I assume this really didn't happen, but did you see any benefit with Zilmax coming off the market? I know, obviously, you didn't have a beta-agonist. Just wondering if there was any other product that could have seen a bump in growth? And then second, do you have plans to ramp production of any specific product category? It looks like medicinal feed additives or maybe implants, I believe, has been a weaker category over the last few years. Wondering now if you have the ability to increase production as a stand-alone company?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Let me probably start with answering the first question with a general comment. I don't think it's positive for the animal health industry that any product is facing regulatory issues or customer issues. And this is something that definitely all companies are exposed to this kind of risk. And I think it's something that, in some cases, this can benefit some of the competitors operating in this space. We decided to launch a generic of ractopamine independently of any kind of issue related to Zilmax. And we are convinced that the product that we are launching had really something that will help producers to enhance productivity, and also to achieve the quantity of meat and affordability of meat that is required by consumers. In terms of plans to ramp any specific category, I think one of the advantage that we have in our portfolio is the diversity in terms of many multiple dimensions, including therapeutic areas. We are convinced that there are areas that are generating some opportunities short term, while others will generate opportunities in more longer and medium term. We want really to make sure that our strategy is really covering these opportunities in all short and long term and definitely we have products in medicinal feed additive. We also have products in implant. And we continue really ensuring that we offer to our customers a complete range of products and solutions to treat or prevent diseases in their animals.", "Dina Fede", "Thank you.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 11, 2014.", "And finally, since Zoetis was not a standalone company in 2012, our financial statements covering periods prior to the IPO do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been, had we operated as a standalone public company, which may make comparisons to prior periods difficult in certain instances.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Dina, and good morning everyone.", "On February 1st, we celebrated our one-year anniversary. And in this first year, we have made a significant progress in standing up as Zoetis has an independent public company, building the infrastructure to support our business and delivering on our financial and strategic objectives.", "We concluded the year with operational revenue growth of 7% and adjusted net income growth of 32%. At species level, we deliver 8% operational growth in companion animal and operational growth of 6% in livestock. Companion animal products now account for 36% of our total annual revenues with livestock progress accounting for 64%.", "In companion animal, sales of products for cats and dogs grew by 8% driven by a strong performance in the U.S., Latin America and Asia. And moderate growth in Western Europe and Australia with 4% decline in the sales of equine products. In some countries such as the U.S., there are signs of recovery in the equine market after five years of decline.", "With addition of APOQUEL in 2014 to our already strong companion animal portfolio we expect to continue the positive sales growth in this segment. And I will talk more about this product later on today's call.", "In livestock, sales of swine and poultry portfolio grew operationally by 12% and 10%. These industries have recovered faster than expected from the drought that affected the U.S. in 2012. These were due to feed costs and higher meat prices in 2013 and given the shortened production cycle allowing operations to more rapidly replenish the supply of animals.", "In cattle, where we deliver operational growth of 2%, in the U.S. had strong show in 2013, especially in the fourth quarter. We also saw a strong performance in India and Mexico. These performances continue to be balanced by the impact of ongoing drought conditions in a number of markets including Australia.", "Now, let me share with you the performance of our four regions. In Asia Pacific and on operational basis, the revenue grew in line with total Zoetis revenue. It is consistent with our expectations which have lowered during the year to reflect the continued impact of the drought in Australia and New Zealand. These two markets represent 1/3rd of revenues for the region. Significant growth in the region came from the emerging markets of China, India and Southeast Asia as well as good performance in Japan, another large market for Zoetis. This was tampered by the flat growth in Australia and the New Zealand where as I mentioned, dry weather conditions remain.", "In Canada, Latin America, as I have noted previously results of the region are primarily influenced by the performance of the two largest markets of Brazil and Canada. These countries account for over 60% of the region sales. For 2013, Brazil was the key driver of the regions growth. With the market as more companion animal business, growing at a significant pace.", "We deliver slower growth rate in livestock with a strong growth in poultry and swine offset by the flat growth in cattle. Despite relatively flat industry performance in Canada, Zoetis deliver growth in this market and this was driven by market conditions positively impacting our anti-infective portfolio and cattle virus and stronger than anticipated sales of flea-and-tick sale products.", "In Europe, Africa, Middle East, emerging markets contribute significantly to 2013 growth. In Russia, we see a longer term growth trend in the livestock industry where there is an increasing focus on sales efficiency in the food supply. In Western Europe, where we had our largest market, while economy challenge remained for our customers we grew modestly.", "We deliver by strong growth across all species in the U.S., our largest region. In companion animal, we saw the benefit of realigning our field force to more effectively cover our customer base. This was in addition to the positive outcomes of our new cross-portfolio pricing programs.", "In livestock strong growth in poultry and swine was offset by the two very different six month performance periods in cattle, the largest species in our U.S. livestock business, it was a year of two-half, if you like. In the first half of 2013, the cattle business saw the impact of higher corn prices affecting the producers demand for our products. Growth in cattle sales picked up in the second half of the year as corn prices fell. For 2014, we expect limited growth in our cattle business as ranches hold back heifers from slaughter for breading purposes. This action, while tempering growth in 2014 is a positive long-term trend for the animal health industry as it indicates the beginning of herd rebuilding. For total Zoetis, operational revenue growth of 7% comprised approximately 5% volume growth and 2% price.", "Now let me provide some recent business highlights from the quarter. This demonstrates the importance of the three core interconnected capabilities of our company. We continue to benefit from our best in class field force. The commercial team remains focused on partnering with our customers to make their businesses successful. We are deepening these relationships with our customers to development of aligned platforms, so they might easily access to our produce as well as to help them better engage their clients.", "According to the latest available external market data, Zoetis grew its revenues faster than the market for both the nine and 12-month periods ending September 30, 2013. This performance is based on the latest information available and we expect to continue to grow faster than the market on a total year basis for 2013.", "Our investments in R&D have been productive. Through the year we have delivered a number of minimal additions and enhancement to our product portfolio. In fact, in 2013 we received many approvals including those for new medicines, claim extensions or entrance into new markets. Some of our most recent approval has been for poultry and swine.", "In swine, we have continued to maximize our investment in the FOSTERA brand with the approval of FOSTERA poultry vaccine in new markets including Mexico, Korea and Thailand. Building on the success of FOSTERA and thanks to the continued innovation from our R&D team, we recently received U.S. approval of our FOSTERA PCV MH product. This is a new combination vaccine for swine and it's the first to offer one bottle, one dose convenience with the flexibility of two dose administration.", "Also in the swine portfolio and during 2013, we launched the first product for our China joint venture Rui Lan An. This product is performing very well. We believe that the product could account for a growing percentage of our revenues in China and become a top 10 product in our portfolio in the market in 2014.", "And now a few words on APOQUEL. This exciting new product was recently launched in the U.S., Germany, Austria and the U.K. APOQUEL is scheduled to launch in the rest of European Union as well as New Zealand in 2014. APOQUEL has been well-received by veterinarians and those of their client that participated in our clinical trials and in the early experience programs in the U.S. Customer demand to-date has already been very high and we are truly excited about its long-term potential. However, as an innovative probably a novel mechanism of action and with only a few weeks in the market it is hard to estimate what the ultimate rate of uptake will be in this product's first year.", "To help manage expectations at this earlier stage we currently believe that APOQUEL could contribute approximately 1% of our revenues in 2014. This is of course dependant upon customer acceptance levels. Changing gears, through the year I have spoken about how our customer's businesses have been impacted by a number of disease outbreaks.", "You would recall that we have talked previously about foreseen epidemic diarrhea virus or PEDv, which is affecting swine herds. This has been a serious impact on the industry in the United States and is now active in 23 states. Cold weather is contributing despite of the outbreak which is impacting according to recent reports up to 30% of sows in the U.S.", "With information available today, we expect a reduction of approximately 4% of the U.S. swine herd and this impact has been incorporated in our guidance range. We will continue monitoring the evolution of the outbreak in the swine industry and the impact in our revenues.", "As you may know, Zoetis recently announced research partnership with Iowa State University, to identify vaccine candidate to help control the virus. The partnership is one element of Zoetis ongoing effort to support swine veterinarians and pork producers in the control of PEDv.", "Also in 2013, Zoetis began correlating with the University of Minnesota to develop a diagnostic test for the disease. Another disease outbreak albeit on a smaller scale has been a new strain of bronchitis affecting poultry flocks. This is a virus that has been first identified by poultry producers in the U.S. State of Georgia in 2008. But one that had began to spread to other southern U.S. states.", "In 2013, in line of the continuing impact of the disease we formed an internal taskforce to deliver the USDA conditionally-licensed vaccine intended for this virus. This provides a valuable tool for our customers in reducing the affects of the disease. Efforts are currently underway to obtain a full USDA license for the vaccine. Our responses to both of these diseases outbreaks further demonstrate our partnership with our customers and the way in which our colleagues work to meet their needs.", "We have remained focused on issuing a steady supply of quality medicines to our customers and the market. In 2013, we deliver sustained improvement in our product availability metrics ensuring that we can more reliable meet the demands of our customers around the world.", "In 2014, our manufacturing and supply organization will include a full-year cost associated with central manufacturing functions that were build through 2013.", "We are also facing some product mix headwinds higher sales in medicated feed additives on poultry together with some products not fully meeting our expectations. One example of these products is Improvac/Improvest. This is an innovative global product that changes animal husbandry practices in the swine industry in a very important way.", "We have been successful with these products in Latin America, but not yet realized its full potential in Europe and U.S. All these elements will represent a challenge to gross margin improvements in 2014.", "Zoetis first year results as well as our 2014 guidance illustrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and the strength of our business model. We are committed to our long-term objective to deliver revenue growth inline with or faster than the market and realize adjusted earnings growth faster than revenues.", "I believe as we are well-positioned to bring added value to our customers, colleagues and shareholders.", "With that I will now ask Rick to walk us through the financial results. Rick?", "Rick Passov", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning.", "I will start with a review of the fourth quarter results and then I will lay out guidance for full-year 2014.", "Turning to the income statement slide, for the fourth quarter revenue was approximately $1.25 billion, an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year including a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign exchange.", "Adjusted net income was a $180 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.36. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $75 million or $0.15 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments acquisition related costs in certain significant items.", "As we mentioned on last quarter's call, our fourth quarter reported results include $13 million and one-time charges related to the integration of our branded generics R&D into our global R&D operations, the divestitures of certain assets in our agricultural business and our decision to exit the manufacturing of intermediate ingredients that we believe we can source more effectively from third parties.", "Also as I mentioned on our last call, during the fourth quarter, we continued to assess the carrying value of certain assets. As a result, we took a one-time charge of $17 million to reflect the impairment of one of our manufacturing facilities.", "And finally, in the fourth quarter, as we continued the transition to our own shared services operation, we wrote-off approximately $17 million of inventory and intercompany accounts that would be transferred to us as part of the separation from Pfizer. Because of these expenses relate to the periods prior to 2012, and prior to our initial public offering, we do not consider them to be reflective of our current operations and are therefore, excluding them from our adjusted earnings a non-GAAP measure.", "Turning now to our adjusted net income statement slide, which I will speak to on an operational basis. Again, revenue was up 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal sales grew $27 million or 7% and livestock sales grew $76 million or 10%. Adjusted cost of sales was 35.4% of revenue versus 36.3% in the year ago quarter, this reflects the impact of a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter, which included certain expenses associated with establishing our own compensation plans as well as other items related to separating from Pfizer.", "Adjusted SG&A decreased by approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, this reflects good expense control as well as similar to COGS a favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted R&D expense decreased approximately 1%, adjusted other income and deductions decreased to $0 in the fourth quarter of 2013. This was primarily due to a royalty true-up combined with losses on foreign exchange exposures.", "Our effective adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 29% reflecting the jurisdictional mix of income and the full year benefit for the U.S. R&D tax credit. And again, on an operational basis, our adjusted net income was $180 million.", "Now, on to our segment results, I will discuss these on an operational basis and it should be noted that segment earnings are pre-tax numbers and reported on an adjusted basis. Beginning with the U.S., fourth quarter revenue was $516 million, an increase of 7%. Sales of livestock products grew 8% with contributions across cattle's, swine and poultry.", "Cattle products showed stronger than expected growth particularly during the later part of the quarter driven by the continued improvement of market conditions in the U.S. Swine and poultry products continue to benefit from customer acceptance of recently-launched vaccine products.", "Sales of companion animal products grew 5% and U.S. segment earnings increased by 11% due to revenue growth and improvements in gross margin driven by price and volume.", "Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, in EuAfME fourth quarter revenue was $330 million, an increase of 9% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 9% driven primarily by recently launched swine and poultry vaccine products particularly in Germany and Russia. Sales of companion animal products also grew 9% and benefited again this quarter from increased sales associated with third-party manufacturing agreements. Excluding these sales, companion animal products sales grew 5%. EuAfME segment earnings increased 24% operationally driven by revenue growth and expense efficiencies in the quarter.", "Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR, fourth quarter revenue was $223 million, an increase of 8% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 7% driven largely by improved market conditions for cattle in Brazil and by increases in sales of medicated feed additives in poultry.", "Sales of companion animal products grew 14% largely driven by sales in Canada due to favorable weather conditions and increasing medicalization of pets in Brazil. CLAR segment earnings increased 24% operationally driven by revenue growth and expense efficiencies as well as a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter.", "In our Asia Pacific or APAC region, fourth quarter sales were $185 million, an increase of 14% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 16%, India had strong poultry and cattle products sales. For poultry, this was in part due to the resolution of a prior year product registration issues for several of our vaccines.", "In Japan, swine sales benefited from recently launched vaccines and China was also a leading contributor mainly in swine products. Growth in these markets more than offset the negative impact of drought conditions in Australia on sales of cattle and sheep products.", "Sales of companion animal products grew 8% led by good performance for recently launched products primarily in Japan. This was partially offset by a decline in sales in Australia, reflecting the benefit in the year ago quarter of equine vaccine sales from the launch of our Hendra vaccine.", "APAC segment operating earnings increased 70% operationally benefiting from revenue growth, expense efficiencies, the timing of promotional spend as well as our favorable true-up and pricing for certain purchases.", "Now let me turn to guidance for full-year 2014. Our guidance for 2014 reflects foreign exchange rates from late January. For full-year 2014, we expect reported revenue of approximately $4.65 billion to $4.75 billion.", "This reflects an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points or approximately $100 million related to the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full-year 2014 is approximately 35.5% of revenue roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost saving efforts offset by the full-year impact of cost incurred to build our global supply functions as well as among other things headwinds from unfavorable mix.", "Adjusted SG&A expenses are expected to be between $1.43 billion and $1.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million. For the full-year 2014, the midpoint of our guidance implies an improvement in the ratio of a total adjusted SG&A and R&D to revenue of approximately 50 basis points.", "We are targeting this improvement despite the fact that 2014 will reflect a full-year of expenses for the standalone corporate functions that were ramping up throughout 2013. Also as we pointed out during the first two quarters of 2013, total adjusted SG&A and R&D expense was less than the full-year run rate.", "As a result, year-over-year growth rate comparisons for the first two quarters of 2014 are expected to be unfavorable. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income is expected to be approximately 29% for the full year, this guidance does not reflect the potential renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2014. And we expected adjusted EPS between $1.48 and $1.54 per share.", "In addition to the FX impact and revenue discussed earlier, our EPS guidance also includes approximately $0.01 impact in OID from the recent evaluation of the Argentine peso. For 2014, we estimate pre-tax charges between $165 million and $185 million which primarily relate to stand-up and acquisition related cost including the impact of these items, our reported diluted EPS for the full-year 2014 is we expected it to be between $1.15 and $1.21 per share.", "Our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health product this year.", "In closing, now that we have a year behind us, I would like to provide an update on our perspectives on capital allocation. First, we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade rating and feel that we would be able to do this while targeting a leverage ratio debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 2.5x. In the near term, we remain focused on completing this stand-up of Zoetis, and were incurring our recurring costs in 2014, which I discussed earlier.", "For 2015, we expect stand-up and acquisition related costs to be less than half of what we expect to occur to incur in 2014. And we will continue to selectively invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business. Beyond that we will look to return capital to shareholders.", "In our first year of operations as a public company we increased our dividend by 11%. As we move past the elevated spend associated with standing up our infrastructure, we believe our free cash flow should support increasing our dividends at or above earnings growth for some period of time. Of course, this is based on current expectations and any future increase would be subject to Board approval.", "That concludes my prepared remarks and now we will open the line for your questions. Dina?", "Dina Fede", "Operator, we are ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Chris Schott - JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks very much for the question. The first question, you reported two consecutive very strong top line results with roughly 9% constant currency growth because I was a bit surprised by the 3% sales growth guidance in 2014, I guess more like 5% constant currency. Just elaborate a little bit more what's happening here that you are seeing a slower growth.", "The second question was on operating margins. I think you mentioned 100 to 150 basis points of expansion this year despite some unfavorable year-over-year expense comps. How do we think about long-term leverage in the model, when we look beyond 2014 and some of these one-time factors kind of getting behind the company? Can we think about maybe more on the 150 end or even larger operating margin expansion opportunities over time? Thanks very much.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Let me take the first question on our revenue position for the 2014. And in 2013, we had significant growth in two species, swine and poultry. Swine grew by 12% and poultry by 10%. We also and we think that this two species will have more moderated growth in 2014 much more in line with the market growth.", "The second element that we also included in our projections for 2014 was in companion animal, we expected the entrance of new classes of molecules in parasiticide. We also expect some additional competition for Rimadyl, generic competition for Rimadyl in the U.S. and of course this will be balanced with the launch of APOQUEL that also will generate a significant growth.", "In cattle, which is the largest livestock species, we expect that in 2014, the cattle ranches will rebuild the herd and as a consequence of that there will be less animals place in the feedlots and this will have an impact in terms of \u2013 and the sales of our products.", "Considering all these elements, we think that the projections that we are making for 2014 are realistic and also in line what we can expect also from the market growth. May be Rick can provide some details on gross margin?", "Rick Passov", "All right. Yes. Chris, I just want to make sure that my numbers were heard correctly and that I understood the numbers that you discussed. So on operating margin in 2013 roughly there is a 300 basis point improvement. What I said in my comments was that the ratio of SG&A to R&D in 2014 based on the midpoint of our guidance is going to be roughly 50 basis point improvement there about. And then as we also spoke on the call, gross margin had a modest improvement in 2013 and our outlook there is flat for 2014 and we described some of the reasons that are driving that.", "So and in terms of a longer term perspective, again, we go back to the basic premise, we believe we will grow at or in line with market. We believe over the long-term our expenses will grow considerably less than that. And we think that margin from there kind of cancels out.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "And we will go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray", "Good morning. Just following up on kind of the underlying market growth assumptions, are you seeing greater use of medications by hog farmers with PEDv going around the country and also with 9 million pounds of beef recalled out in California and a plant shut down, doesn't that make the existing cattle herd even more valuable so that could also drive increases in medications?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you for the question Kevin. And you are right. We expect that with fewer animals, these animals will have more valuable to the cattle businesses and we expect that also they will ensure that they have the right healthcare protocols to keep these animals for that business. But this will be compensated in someway because of the fewer animals that will be available for placement in 2014 based on the assumption that the ranchers will probably rebuild the herd and this will keep these animals for this purpose.", "In terms of greater use of medicines because of PEDv what we have seen is that definitely the PEDv it's reducing the number of animals available. I mention that the sows affected by the PEDv in the U.S. it's about 30% and it is expected to have an impact of reduction of 4% in terms of total animals available in the market. What the producers are indicating is that the way that they expect to compensate these fewer animals it will be to have these animals longer in terms of reaching higher weight that will also contain the number of pork available to the market. This may represent an opportunity if they keep these animals longer also to keep these animals under certain healthcare protocols. Although when they reach certain weight they are less vulnerable to infections or other diseases.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, our next question please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Louise Chen - Guggenheim", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, we had a quite a few calls this morning from investors regarding the guidance that you gave for 2014 and maybe some more explanation behind it, but I'll just delve back on that again. So I'm kind of curious how we should think about modeling your top line and bottom line growth longer term. I understand some of the headwinds this year and, should we just be patient the 2013, 2014 there are some meaningful headwinds and then after that we should kind of get to the kind of growth rate that people had expected at the time of the IPO, which is more 6% to 7% top line and double digit bottom line growth?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "And in terms of revenues, we see that Zoetis will be growing in this five years companion animal growth in line with the market and the market is expected to grow around 5% to 6%. We also expect that our expenses will be inline with inflation and we also expect that we will generate gross margin improvement over time. Let me provide may be some comments on why we are not meeting our objective for 2014 in terms of gross margin.", "So one element it's the mix of products. So in 2013, we have the significant growth in swine and poultry especially in poultry that the margins are lower and these also creating some mix challenge in terms of gross margin. We also had some geographies that also impacting the mix of geographies are also impacting our geography, we are growing faster in some of the major markets and these are major markets they still have lower margin that than more developed markets. The third element is that in 2014, we are facing some unexpected synergies like freight. Again, so it's something that definitely we are working and we expect this something that will not have a long-term impact since we will be able really to achieve our target in terms of this kind of cost.", "We see that also some of this additional impact in cost will be offset by cost reductions also will be offset by pricing but there are some elements that also are affecting our gross margin improvement in 2014. We were expecting to generate significant growth out of a product that has a significant potential, it's a product that it's called Improvest/Improvac this product has been extremely successful in Brazil and we were expecting the same kind of success in Europe and the U.S.", "Unfortunately the market acceptance is taking longer in these two important regions and these are having an impact in terms of revenues but also in terms of volume that it will be absorbing significant cost in our operations. We still remain convinced that this product is really providing a significant opportunities not only in terms of replacing surgical castration in pigs to eliminate boar tint but also having feed enhancement that will result also in higher productivity for the swine producers.", "These products have a significant opportunity and we expect that this product will generate revenues and also a positive impact in our gross margin in the future. We expect that our actions that we are taking in 2014 will result in cost, of course improvement in 2015 and 2016 and also beyond. So we are committed to improve our gross margin and we see that this situation in 2014 is a temporary situation that we expect to solve in the future.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "We'll go next go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Could you please talk about your business development strategy and whether you are primarily focused on livestock and companion animal businesses, it would seem there are number of promising companion animals which add new assets out there?", "And if I may follow up, your revenue this quarter benefited from again from third party manufacturing agreement, how should we think about this opportunity in 2014? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Okay. Let me start with the business development and also Rick can provide comments on the third party manufacturing agreements. In terms of BD, we will remain focused on ensuring that we maximize the opportunities that we have in our portfolio and also the opportunities that will generate through our investments in R&D will not exclude opportunities in terms of adding products for a certain species or certain therapeutic classes in where we can really fill gaps or also expanding our presence in some of the markets.", "But definitely, it's something that we will consider opportunities as they come. And there will be two conditions that always will be in our analysis, one the strategic feed and the second the financial to support that acquisition. We are not really focused on either livestock on companion animal, I think something that we will be open to any opportunity that will meet these two conditions.", "Rick Passov", "And then Alex on the question on the third-party manufacturing to remind us again of what that is, we're obligated to provide supply for some of the divested products plus we also now have a small component of third-party manufacturing that we do on behalf of Pfizer. We do expect that the amount of this volume for us will decline around 15% year-over-year probably in the early 50 millions to somewhere in the early 40 millions and we haven't made a long-term decision about the extent to which we'll decide to continue on some of these contracts as they decline or what kind of partnership will remain with Pfizer we're on \u2013 in the long-term where this fits into our overall manufacturing operations.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erin Wilson - Bank of America", "Hi, it's Erin Wilson. Juan Ram\u00f3n, I guess going back to the revenue growth questions in the press release and then in the prepared remarks do you see that the 2014 outlook supports your overall long-term goal of faster than market growth? But the guidance seems to call for at least in line if not below the industry trend, what's the disconnect there in light of kind of the new product launches and recent strength you've see?", "My second question would be just broadly speaking to the slower growth in livestock markets and inherently lower margin business positively impact the product mix on a gross margin standpoint, so could there be upside to your estimates there?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Okay. In terms of our performance against the market, while the information available today its the third quarter year-to-date where we have been growing significantly faster than the market in 2013. And we expect also the fourth quarter to confirm these results. If, what we always communicated, it's our commitment to grow inline or faster than market on a companion animal terms. And if you take our growth in 2013, and also with the projections that we are making for 2014, we think that this growth in companion animal growth will be faster than the market.", "We expect that the new products will add some additional revenues and APOQUEL is a very good example. But you need to also to keep in mind that in 2013, we also launched a significant number of products, so we generated very positive growth of new products in 2013. And I think it's something that definitely we are convinced that at the end of the year, so the growth that we will be generating will be supporting this growth faster than the market or inline with the market.", "The second question was slower livestock growth and positive for gross margin. While there are many different elements in this statement, so one its -- I mentioned that we are growing now faster than in poultry and swine than in cattle. And this is having an impact in our gross margin. Second element, we have also been growing at least in 2013, so we have now a higher base of medicated feed additives also with the lower margin than pharmaceuticals or vaccine.", "And the third element is the growth in emerging markets and this growth in emerging markets it's \u2013 well, there are two components definitely the companion animal but also they are growing very fast in terms of livestock. All these elements are driving our gross margin performance in 2014.", "Rick, I don't know if you want to add any other comment?", "Rick Passov", "The only small amount of color, I would add is just that if we look also Erin, I think you had said that the lower growth that we might be anticipating on a relative basis year-over-year in livestock would be an improvement in margin. I think Juan Ram\u00f3n answered that I think also its worth pointing out that in companion animal we have new products and we also have some new competitors and those things are balanced in our forecast for the companion animal growth in 2014 as well.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "We will go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.", "Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group", "Hey, guys thanks for taking the question. Also thanks for all the quick very clear commentary. I just, hey, Rick, I just want to make sure I've got some math correct. You mentioned I think I heard you say something like $100 million currency impact to your 2014 guidance, just clarify that should we basically just be adding if you wanted to do constant currency should we just be adding $100 million to your revenue guidance. And if I were to do that to try to create more of a like-for-like comparison it looks to me like your operating margins in 2014 will expand not 50 basis points, but about 130 basis points. Is my math correct or was there also some kind of offsetting impact on the OpEx line from the fluctuations you expect in currency?", "And then just a follow up is, if your revenue guidance proves conservative, if it were as analyst investors should we still look at your SI&A (sic) SG&A and R&D dollar guidance as the number that you are going to shoot for? Even if you get lucky and say your revenue growth is 2% or 3% higher than what you're projecting? Thanks again for all the detail.", "Rick Passov", "Mark, no problem. Let me just start back at the very beginning of the question. So at the average rate of FX for us over the course of 2013, we're giving you this range of about $100 million of lost revenue. If we were to apply the average rates in 2013 across how we expect the numbers to roll-out for us in 2014, exactly how that falls through the P&L there are a lot of different ways that you can do it, we haven't really worked out that math for us but you can use the P&L is an indicative model or hair cut that in a number of different ways.", "And in terms of -- to the extent that we get more or less revenue what is going to be the impact on SG&A as a percent of sales. I think it depends on a lot of factors, we can find ourselves in periods of time where revenue growth is also being accompanied by more promotional activities. So it's hard for me to give you a fixed line there. And also want to make sure that I'm not misquoted on the 50 basis points that I spoke to. Again, in my prepared remarks, I was simply saying that if you take the midpoint of the guidance for just SG&A and just R&D as a percent of revenue, you'll see that they were targeting in that midpoint range roughly 50 basis point improvement.", "I'm simply pointing out that in a year when we are facing peak to synergies as part of the standup from \u2013 in our standup efforts, we're still showing you at least in this ratio cost improvement benefits. And then I'd also point out that we had negative SG&A growth in 2013. So, if you add up 2013 and 2014, I think you get a year representative of what Juan Ram\u00f3n has described as an average year that's representative of what Juan Ram\u00f3n has described as our longer term goals.", "Dina Fede", "", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "John Kreger - William Blair", "", "Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the underlying assumptions for the 2014 guidance. Are you assuming any improvement in the economic environment particularly on the companion side? And what about the price versus volume mix that underlies that 2% to 4% revenue growth expectation? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Probably the answer to that, it's not completely straight forward. So we expect some economic improvement in some of the European markets. At the same time there are uncertainties at this point in some of the emerging economies. And in these economies, I think it's something that at this point we are taking some questions in terms of growth that these economies will generate and also the impact that these growth will have in the animal healthcare industry.", "That's why we're still providing this range that is reflecting these uncertainties that we still have not only related to the economies but also related to some environmental factors that can be affecting our business. On the second question, it's what about the --", "Rick Passov", "Pricing.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "The pricing volume in \u2013 so in 2013, we generated higher volumes than price in our total revenue growth. I mentioned that on the 7% operational growth, 5% was volume, 2% was price. We expect that in 2014, the growth will be balanced between price and volume. And definitely we see opportunities of price increases in both livestock and also companion animal and also both in developed animal healthcare markets. Although, we see that emerging markets we will have a much more moderated price increases than a developed markets.", "Dina Fede", "Next question please.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, Juan Ram\u00f3n and Rick. I have a couple of questions mainly about the financials. So, first with respect to FX, Rick, could you just talk about the impact of FX on the bottom-line in 2013? And then obviously, FX benefits your operating expenses in 2014.", "Is there any way to characterize the FX driven reduction in operating cost for 2014? And then separately with respect to corporate costs, could you just remind us where your corporate costs are, where they were in 2013 and how we should think about that number trending over time and whether there are any meaningful cost reduction opportunities or not? Thank you.", "Rick Passov", "", "Thank you for the question, David. Let me start with the FX piece. The FX impact for 2013 was considerably less than what we're seeing in 2014. And yes, there is an FX component that would be somewhat of a benefit to SG&A but less so than you might think depending on which geographies we're making investments for growth and as well less so from an R&D perspective.", "And then \u2013 I'm sorry what was the \u2013 the second question was the kind of -- how to look at our corporate costs. So, one thing that is between 2012 and 2013 is a reallocation between what's in R&D which is part of our corporate function and what was in unallocated overhead bucket in our carve out financials that helps you sort of see 2012 and 2013 change.", "And then as we spoke in the other parts of what we call our corporate costs are a couple of things the build up of essential organization for manufacturing, so we built our own global supply points. And then as well those functions that resided in Pfizer where there was no analog in Zoetis. So, tax, treasury P&A to a large degree, internal audit and so on and as well the IT function.", "And the majority of the standup delta if you will, maybe I could use the word synergies have been occurred to-date and I think we've done a very good job of offsetting them. They don't on a \u2013 where you'll see the largest impact if you will is comparing the rate of growth in SG&A for example in Q1 of 2014 to the rate of growth in Q1 of 2013 and that's because in Q1 of 2013 and in Q2 of 2013 we called out that \u2013 the SG&A plus R&D as a percent of revenue was below what we expected the run rate would be for the full-year or even our indicative run rate.", "And so, when you make those quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year comparisons, you'll see somewhat unfavorable growth but it will certainly balance out pretty well as we get through the rest of the year. And then going forward, again, I think that the operating leverage is going to come from that basic tenant that we keep going back to growing at or faster than the market and controlling operating expenses to be roughly in line with inflation and modest gross margin improvement.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Ariel Herman - Goldman Sachs", "", "Hi, this is Ariel Herman in for Jami. So, wanted to follow up on two things. First, is there an updated view on your thoughts around M&A and further industry consolidation? And do you guys see yourself as participating with that and if so do you guys need M&A to sustain margin expansion.", "And then just separately going back to the revenue outlook, so I understand there is some one-time events in 2014 such as the moderate growth in swine and poultry, but 2013 also had some one-time event such as drought that I would have thought would have made good comps for 2014. So just thinking longer term, how do you get back to that 5% to 6%? And how should we think about growth in each regional segment within that overall company growth? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Ariel, for the question. Let me answer first the second question on the projections for 2014 and the different impact of the drought. The drought of the U.S. in 2012 had different impact depending on the species. Definitely on swine and poultry, we saw that the impact in these two species in 2013 was much softer than we expected. In fact these two species recovered very fast even in the first half of 2013 from the drought, because of mainly at that time, the meat price grew significantly. And then in the second half of the year, the prices remained high, but also the prices for corn were much lower than 2012.", "So, in these two species the drought had a very little impact, in fact swine and poultry for us grew by 12% and 10%. It is a different \u2013 the situation for the cattle industry. So the cattle industry in the first half of 2013 was affected by the drought but had a significant recovery in the second half of the year. So in total as I mentioned these species grew by 3% in our revenues.", "What we expect in 2014 is to have full-year of normalized weather conditions. But, because of the projections on cattle are now positive, the ranchers have decided that to increase the herd. The result of increasing the herd as I mentioned will be less animals place in the feedlot where the majority of the process are used and then the better situation in terms of weather conditions will be in some way offset by the fact that there will be fewer animals to treat in the feedlot.", "If I move to the first question in terms of my views in terms of M&A. So definitely, it has been a lot of news recently from other animal health companies, I think we will not enter in speculating what will be the outcome of all these strategic reviews that other competitors are making. We are convinced that our internal growth will be supporting our objectives of growing in line or faster than the market in this companion animal growth in middle to long-term. And we see maybe opportunities on some of the complementary spaces or some of the process that will be filling gaps in our portfolio.", "And one important element is that we already have our market share which is close to 20%, 19%. This can create some challenge in terms of antitrust. And it is something that we will really -- understanding and monitoring all the different decisions that our competitors will be making and then we'll decide depending on what will be available in the market.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "", "We'll go next to Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Liav Abraham \u2013 Citi", "", "Good morning. Just one quick question on your tax rate. Rick, did you see any opportunities to reduce your effective tax rate going forward and is this a focus for you at all? Thanks very much.", "Rick Passov", "Thank you, for the question. We get that a lot. Tax is obviously, for a number of reasons, are out in the\u2013 somebody has their line open -- are in front of us quite a lot. I would say that we're seeing the opportunity for some marginal lowering of the effect of tax rate just based on the good cash flow generation in the business and what we see our future needs are. And in terms of what the ultimate degree of freedom is for us to change our tax rate.", "We're pretty much where we're going to be plus the benefit of the R&D tax credit which we'd like to see at some point during 2014 and perhaps could add the opportunity to lower the 29% by up to about 50 basis points. And then I think there that's going to be good long-term estimate of what the effective tax rate is for Zoetis.", "Dina Fede", "Operator, I think we have time for one more question please.", "Operator", "", "We'll take our last question from David Krempa with Morningstar. Please go ahead.", "David Krempa \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Thanks for taking my question. Just quick follow-up on that tax question, would you guys ever be open to an inversion that would significantly lower that tax rate but might also bringing in some human health products?", "Rick Passov", "That's an interesting question. I can understand the reason why it's asked. And obviously, a number of companies have found something in that strategy that works for them, but it's not something that we're contemplating.", "Dina Fede", "Thank you. That concludes our call. Have a good day.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically.", "In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. [Operator Instructions]", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.", "John O'Connor", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Senior Vice President of Finance Operations and Acting Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ram\u00f3n and Glenn will provide an overview of our quarterly results, and then we will open the call for your questions.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of today's slides and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including our recent 10-K and 10-Qs.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items, such as the nonrecurring cost of becoming a standalone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today August 5, 2014. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "I also want to remind you that beginning last quarter, we realigned our segment reporting with respect to our Client Supply Services organization, or CSS, which provides contract manufacturing services for third parties. The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within other business activities, separate from the 4 reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, John, and thank you to those joining us for today's call. I would like to start by sharing high-level details of our performance for the second quarter. During this period, we delivered operational growth of 6% in revenues and 11% in adjusted net income or adjusted diluted EPS of $0.38. We also delivered operational revenue growth across each of our geographical segments in the quarter, reflecting the strength and balance of our diverse portfolio. This illustrates that our continued focus on building strong customer relationships, bringing new products to the market, while managing the product lifecycles and producing high-quality products and reliable supply, all remain fundamental strengths of our business and model.", "Let me now comment on the performance of our business by species. The performance of our livestock segment grew by 9%. Here, we see more favorable market conditions for many of our customers across the globe. Overall, worldwide demand for meat protein continues increasing, especially in emerging markets. In these markets, their objective is to increase their local production. But to meet their needs, they still depend on key export markets, such as the U.S. and Brazil, where we also have a significant presence.", "Additionally, feed costs continue to moderate for our customers. Nevertheless, conditions will remain difficult for some producers in certain markets in Asia Pacific and in Europe. And factors such as disease outbreaks and climate conditions are placing some limitations on how quickly our customers can expand protein production. These conditions reinforce the value of our medicines and technology for more efficient production. As producers work to supply greater volumes of meat protein by increasing cattle and swine slaughter weights, we expect to see continued strong demand for our products. Our global presence and breadth of portfolio positions -- so it is well to capitalize on these positive trends.", "Let me take a deeper dive into some of these individual species, starting with cattle, which grew 10% operationally. We delivered strong growth in all regions, most notably in the Canada/Latin American region, where we implemented new pricing strategies in a number of Latin American countries. Poultry delivered operational growth of 11%. All regions contributed to these, but particular in the U.S., where sales of our medicated feed additives and also vaccines delivered double-digit growth.", "In swine, PEDv has continued to spread, not only in the U.S., but also in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and a number of other countries. The virus is reducing the size of swine herds, and producers are working to offset these reductions by raising higher-weight animals.", "Additionally, our business has felt the impact of antibiotic regulations in Europe. In spite of these conditions, Zoetis is still the leader, based on growth of 5% in swine, thanks to introduction of new products.", "Moving now on to companion animal. We delivered 2% operational growth in the quarter. Sales of our canine product APOQUEL contributed to the growth in this sector, even as we continue to address our levels of supply for this product. I will talk a little bit more about APOQUEL later on this call.", "Overall, while growth fundamentals for companion animal remains strong in all countries, and particularly in emerging markets, we have seen an increase in competition in many of our larger developed markets. This is primarily from new product introductions in parasiticides and in vaccines. We are confident that the breadth of our portfolio, including new product launches, as well as the strength of our field force and our world-class capabilities in R&D, will enable us to stay competitive in this market.", "Across our business, we continue to see that the depth and the diversity of our portfolio plays a critical role in the overall performance of our company and also sustain our competitive advantage.", "The depth and diversity is demonstrated by our portfolio for multiple species across 5 therapeutic areas and by the 300 products marketed in 120 countries. As a result of this quarter's performance, and our forecast for the rest of the year, we are increasing the lower end of our guidance range for revenue, adjusted EPS and SG&A for the full year.", "Now, I would like to provide an update on our portfolio, and in particular, highlight our R&D progress and the latest for APOQUEL. Earlier, I spoke about the impact of PEDv on our business. Now, let me share with you some details of the progress that we are making on developing a vaccine for this disease, where we have 2 programs. Our most advanced program is for an inactivated or kill vaccine. On this, we are working closely with the USDA and expect to request approval for a conditional license in 2014. Following any approval, we anticipate that we will be able to supply the markets soon after.", "We also continued our work with Iowa State University on an additional vaccine approach. We are making good progress and will provide updates of this program as the research evolves.", "Finally, we continue working with the University of Minnesota for a PEDv diagnostic test and this type of test will help producers to rapidly identify potential infections in their herds. The result from these research programs will also have applicability outside of the U.S. We are exploring regulatory approaches to enhance the reach of these potential products in all the affected markets.", "This quarter, we secured regulatory approval and launched ACTOGAIN. This ractopamine product for the use in cattle, alone or in combination with other commonly used medicated feed additives. This in addition to our already-strong cattle portfolio. The approval of ACTOGAIN builds on the success of the launch of ENGAIN, also a ractopamine product, which was approved and recently launched for use in swine. Both ACTOGAIN and ENGAIN are performing better than expected. This performance is in part driven by the removal of a competing product from the market.", "And finally, to our progress with APOQUEL. As you will remember, this is an innovative medicine designed to relieve dogs from pruritus. We launched the product in the U.S. and in a number of European markets early this year and have seen significant levels of customer demand for the product. This has resulted in a supply shortage. Our priorities at this point are to ensure that dogs currently being treated with APOQUEL continue to receive their product without interruption and to normalize the product supply as soon as possible.", "As noted on our last call, the process to produce APOQUEL is complex. We are working to reduce the length of time it takes to manufacture the product and to add manufacturing capacity. By April, next year, we expect to significantly increase the supply of APOQUEL, and as a result, we'll be able to begin offering APOQUEL to new customers.", "Based on our current market demand, the introduction of the product in new markets, and our plans to increase supply, we now expect the product to generate in excess of $100 million in revenues next year.", "And before I ask Glenn to walk us through the financials, I would like to highlight our coming Investor Day. This will take place on November 18 at The New York Stock Exchange. We're very excited to be able to host this event and look forward to having the opportunity to share with you more details of our strategy, capabilities and value propositions, as well as the overall animal healthcare industry.", "And with that, Glenn?", "Glenn David", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Let me start today with a review of the second quarter results and then discuss our guidance for full year 2015.", "Turning first to the income statement slide. For the second quarter, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2 percentage points on revenue, primarily due to the impact of currencies in Brazil, Australia, Argentina and Canada, which were partially offset by improvements in the euro and sterling. As a result, operational growth, excluding the impact of currency, was 6%.", "Reported net income was $136 million or $0.27 per diluted share, and adjusted net income was $189 million or $0.38 per diluted share, representing growth of 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $53 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items, the majority of which were related to stand-up cost.", "Certain significant items this quarter also include a one-time charge related to a commercial settlement with customers in Mexico. This settlement is with several of our large poultry customers in Mexico. It is associated with certain shipments from specific lots of poultry vaccine products, and we have moved ahead with a recall of these lots. No other countries or lots are impacted. We have recorded a reserve associated with this issue in the second quarter of $13 million. I will discuss the impact of this settlement on our reported guidance in a few minutes.", "Let's now turn to our adjusted income statement slide, which I will discuss primarily on an operational basis. Again, operational revenue growth for the second quarter was 6%. In terms of the first half of the year, we reported revenue growth of 2%, with operational growth of 5%. This reflects an impact on reported revenue of approximately $55 million due to foreign exchange. Based on current rates, we expect the impact from foreign exchange for the remaining 2 quarters will be minimal.", "Turning to more revenue details in the second quarter. Companion animal sales were 38% of sales in the quarter and grew $7 million or 2% operationally. Livestock sales were 61% of sales in the quarter and grew $57 million or 9% operationally. Adjusted cost of sales grew operationally by 4%, 2 points lower than operational sales growth. Adjusted cost of sales was 35% of revenue, versus 35.9% in the year ago quarter, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the benefit of price increases, which were partially offset by unfavorable mix.", "For the first half of the year, our adjusted cost of sales grew operationally by 1% and was 34.6% of revenue. As we said last quarter, we continue to expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue in the remaining quarters and bring us in line with the full year guidance of approximately 35.5%, which we are reaffirming today. This dynamic reflects the recognition of additional costs from building a global manufacturing and supply organization, which will be most evident in the second half of the year, as well as our expectation that foreign exchange will not have as favorable an impact on gross margin as it did in the first half of the year.", "Meanwhile, adjusted SG&A increased by 9% operationally in the second quarter. As we have said, in the first 2 quarters of 2013, we were still building out many of the corporate functions needed to support Zoetis as an independent public company. We largely completed this process in the third quarter of last year and this unfavorable comparison is a driver of SG&A growth in the second quarter of 2014.", "We also saw elevated growth in operating expenses in the U.S., EuAfME, and CLAR segments in the quarter as well. As part of our normal course of business, we continue to adjust investments and promotional activities to respond to market opportunities.", "Year-to-date, SG&A was 30.6% of revenue, consistent with our full year guidance, which is approximately 31% at the midpoints of both SG&A and revenue. In other items, adjusted R&D expense increased 1% operationally. Interest expense declined $3 million in the quarter and adjusted other income was $3 million in the quarter, similar to last year. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 28.4%. And again, our adjusted net income was $189 million, representing reported growth of 6%, and operational growth of 11%.", "Now on to our segment results. I will discuss these on an operational basis, but it should be noted that segment earnings are pretax numbers and presented on an adjusted basis. I will also highlight some of the more significant foreign exchange impacts in the regional results.", "Beginning with the U.S., second quarter revenue was $459 million, an increase of 5%. Sales of livestock products grew 10%, with contributions across cattle, poultry and swine. Cattle products showed a significant increase based on improved market conditions from the year ago quarter. Cattle prices have continued to rise, with feed cost remaining low. While we have seen the number of placements declining, customers are placing younger, lighter animals into feed lots. And these cattle are more vulnerable to illness and disease and require treatment. This dynamic, along with continued growth in market share, has contributed to growth in our U.S. cattle business despite lower overall placements in the quarter.", "We saw poultry product growth driven by new vaccines, such as the Georgia 08 vaccine, as well as growth in medicated feed additives. And in swine products, we benefited from continued growth in new products, such as our PCV M. hyo combination vaccine, DRAXXIN 25 anti-infective and ENGAIN feed additive. This new product momentum was tempered by the effect of PEDv, which Juan Ram\u00f3n addressed.", "Sales of companion animal products grew 1%. This was driven by sales of APOQUEL, which was partially offset by declines from an increased competition in vaccines and RIMADYL. Meanwhile, U.S. segment earnings increased by 2%, as growth in revenue was offset by higher expenses, primarily due to promotional investments. For the first half of the year in the U.S., we had revenue growth of 5% and earnings growth of 10%. This is more indicative of the leverage that we expect in the U.S. than the second quarter results.", "Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, or EuAfME. In EuAfME, second quarter revenue was $284 million, an increase of 4% operationally. Reported revenue growth was 7%, reflected a positive impact of 3 percentage points in the quarter due to the strength of the euro and sterling. Sales of livestock products increased 5% operationally, as the region experienced more positive results in Germany, the U.K. and Spain than in the first quarter, but this was slightly offset by declines in France. The livestock growth was primarily driven by increased sales in cattle and poultry products, which were slightly offset by a decline in swine products for the quarter. While weather conditions across Europe were generally more favorable than the prior year, growth in livestock was limited in the U.K. and Scandinavia by severe flooding, which affected seasonal herd movements.", "Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 2% operationally, primarily due to sales of APOQUEL in the U.K. and Germany, and growth in emerging markets. This companion animal growth was somewhat offset by declines in France and Southern Europe due to increased competition in parasiticides. EuAfME segment earnings increased 9% operationally, primarily due to the revenue increase and higher gross margins, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.", "Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment, or CLAR. Second quarter revenue was $214 million, an increase of 11% operationally. Reported revenue growth was flat, reflecting a negative impact of 11 percentage points in the quarter, primarily due to depreciation of currencies in Brazil, Argentina and Canada. Overall for the segment, sales of livestock products grew 13% operationally and sales of companion animal products grew 6% operationally. The CLAR segment results were largely driven by the region's 2 largest markets, Brazil and Canada, while price growth for livestock products in high inflation markets, such as Venezuela and Argentina, also made significant contributions to growth in the quarter.", "In Brazil, growth was driven primarily by sales of cattle and poultry products, as well as companion animal products. Meanwhile, the company generated increased sales of cattle products in Canada, as higher prices for cattle led to increased treatments. Canada also saw an increase in sales of swine products, such as anti-infectives and vaccines, while it posted a slight decline in poultry products.", "CLAR segment earnings increased 16% on an operational basis, driven by revenue growing at a faster rate than operating expenses.", "In Asia Pacific, or APAC, second quarter sales were $185 million, an increase of 5% operationally. Our APAC segment also felt a significant impact due to depreciation from currencies in Australia, Japan, India and other countries, which led to a negative 6 percentage point impact on revenue.", "Sales of livestock products grew 7% operationally, driven primarily by sales of cattle products in New Zealand and Australia, growth of swine products in China and growth of poultry products in Australia and India. This growth was offset by declines in Japan and Korea. In Australia, we saw an increase in the movement of herds to feedlots, which benefited our business as treatments increased. However, climate conditions remain difficult, and we expect the higher feedlot activity to lead to reduce herd sizes in the coming quarters.", "Sales of companion animal products increased 1% operationally, largely due to an increase in equine products in Australia, which was offset by declines in companion animal products in Japan. APAC segment operating earnings increased 11% operationally, due to revenue growth, a decline in operating expenses and slightly favorable gross margin.", "Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2014. We have now reported 1/2 of the fiscal year and remained confident in our ability to deliver on our full year financial guidance. As a result, we are narrowing our financial guidance for revenue, adjusted SG&A, and adjusted EPS for full year 2014, and making an adjustment to our reported EPS guidance. We have raised the lower end of our revenue guidance, and now expect reported revenue of approximately $4.675 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost-savings efforts, which is forecasted to be offset by the full year impact of cost incurred to build our global manufacturing and supply functions, as well as unfavorable mix. The incremental cost will be reflected primarily in the second half of 2014.", "Adjusted SG&A expenses are now expected to be between $1.44 billion and $1.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million. We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29%. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. And we have raised the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance and now expect adjusted EPS of between $1.50 and $1.54 per share for the full year. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any further currency devaluation in Venezuela. This guidance reflects our ability to achieve our profitability targets as we absorb multiple headwinds in 2014, including: The incremental costs of standing up our global manufacturing and supply operations; unfavorable comparisons in corporate function expense; and an additional month of higher interest expense.", "Separately, we now estimate pretax charges for 2014 of between $175 million and $195 million, primarily related to stand-up and acquisition-related cost. This range has increased due to the commercial settlement charge related to Mexico that I mentioned earlier. These charges are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items, as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for reported diluted EPS for full year 2014 will now be between $1.16 and $1.20 per share, a change from the $1.15 to $1.21 range we had previously set. This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year.", "Our long-term value proposition remains anchored in 3 objectives: to grow revenue in line with or faster than the market; to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue; and to find investment opportunities with strong returns to our business and return excess capital to our shareholders.", "That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we will open the line for your questions. John?", "John O'Connor", "Thank you, Glenn. Operator, first question, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "First, on your vaccine -- on your PED vaccine. Will you have a competitive advantage in getting this vaccine to the market? If you could just give us a better sense as to where the competitors are and what kind of commercial opportunity are we looking at? And a quick follow-up, if I may, I'm not sure if I understand it, Ram\u00f3n, correctly on APOQUEL. Did I hear you correctly in saying that you expect to have supply to the market, increased supply to the market, later this year? Or is it still a 2015 expectation?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Alex, it's Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix. So let me start confirming that for APOQUEL, we expect that to normalize supply next year in April. And at that time, I will be able to supply more product to new customers. On the first question, on the PEDv, so we have a program now that we expect to complete soon and to submit that to the FDA, a conditional -- license for conditional approval. And there is one vaccine already in the market covering this disease. And we expect that our vaccine also will cover the needs of swine producers to protect animals against this outbreak and its high significant impact on their herds.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Certainly. We'll next go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.", "Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "My question on the business is maybe on use of cash, if I may. In your last slide, where you kind of summed up the 3 big priorities, I suppose, for the next 5 years. The last one is to find profitable investment opportunities and return excess capital to shareholders. So I was wondering, we haven't seen a lot of M&A yet at Zoetis. So I'm wondering why that is? And if we should expect the pace to pick up? And then the follow-up on that is the dividend. I don't think we've seen much of a dividend raise since you guys have spun out of Pfizer. So I was wondering if just philosophically, you could talk to us and maybe help set expectations, what we should expect about the rate of dividend increases.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Mark, on the first question on M&A, so in 2013, that it was the first year of Zoetis as an independent company. We were focused on standing up our operations and then, we decided that maybe it was not the right time for us to consider on M&A activity. We are now that -- we have, in most of the cases, completed our infrastructure, with the exception of IT. We think that we can now consider M&A opportunity that the market brings to us. And we'll be active pursuing these opportunities. We know that because of our size and our market share, we may face some challenge in terms of antitrust. This will incorporate it in our analysis, but definitely, we will consider any opportunity that will match our strategic objective, and also will provide the return on the investment.", "Glenn David", "Mark, related to your question on dividends. So today, we have increased our dividend. And subject to board approval, we do expect to grow the dividend at a rate that is equal to or faster than our growth in adjusted net income.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question please?", "Operator", "Certainly. We'll take a question now from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.", "Jessica M. Fye - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Jessica Fye on for Chris. A question on gross margin, just as we're starting to think about next year. Can you just remind us how much of your manufacturing Pfizer still does? And how we should think about the impact of that, I think there's some manufacturing royalty kicking in for the product they supply you with next year? And then maybe also just following up on Mark's question on M&A. We're seeing a number of tax inversion transactions across the space and just would like to hear your views on whether that will be of interest to Zoetis.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So in terms of M&A, also, this tax inversion opportunity, we will continue to exploring any opportunity that will provide reduction in terms of effective tax rate, something that definitely we will see the opportunities the market -- that exist in the market. And we will decide based on these opportunities. On the gross margin, I will ask Glenn to respond to your question.", "Glenn David", "So in terms of gross margin for 2015 and specifically to the impact of the Pfizer MSA. So when we looked at the potential impact of the Pfizer MSA, that it might have in 2015. Based on 2013 costs and volumes, we expected it to have about a $30 million negative impact on cost of goods going into 2015. We've taken a lot of actions to minimize that impact, and those actions have resulted in reducing that exposure by about 1/2. However, since then, a number of those products, APOQUEL being one of them, have had growth in volume. So it will limit our ability to bring the $30 million down fully, but we have taken many actions to minimize the impact.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Certainly. Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "First off, we've seen some pretty strong livestock trends, especially in the U.S. Just wondering if you can keep up kind of the high single-digit, low double-digit growth in the U.S.? And then second, regarding your operating cost, and you have a direct sales model, especially in the U.S. Just wondering if there's any ability for you guys to leverage the operating cost by maybe laying on distributors and using some of the national distributors more to minimize or drive some more leverage in the model.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "On the performance on livestock, definitely on the second quarter, we reported very strong growth. We see that the demand for animal proteins remained very strong in the worldwide market. We also see that the profitability of livestock producers -- it's now very high. They have high price of the meat, low prices for input, which increases significantly the profitability. And this is also driving the willingness of livestock producers to increase the herd, to supply all the market demand. We don't see any change in the near future, so we expect that the livestock market will continue growing in the future. In terms of our direct sales model, so we are convinced that the demand generation model that we have, which means that our own field force and also our own group of veterinarians are interacting directly with customers. And this interaction is generating very strong demand and very strong support to our portfolio. In the U.S., we combined our direct efforts with partnership with distributors, for those customers that we don't have the reach because of economical conditions. And we see that this model is working very well, and we'll continue supporting our product portfolio through this direct interaction, and also with the combination and partnership with some of our distributors that will reach these smaller customers.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Certainly. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.", "Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So first question I had was on SG&A leverage. What is your ideal level of SG&A leverage and when do you expect to get there after you finish this Pfizer separation? And then second question I had was, we've seen a number of development-stage, companion animal health companies starting up. I'm just curious, your thoughts on the unmet needs these companies address and if there's potential partnership opportunities here?", "Glenn David", "So this is Glenn. I'll address the SG&A question. In terms of the SG&A leverage, so the way we think about this is, in 2014 in particular, we have indicated that we do have incremental expenses related to building up our corporate functions, and that is increasing the level of growth we expect in SG&A this year. However, over the long term, we do expect to grow SG&A in line with inflation, while being able to grow our revenue at a pace faster than the market, which will continue to improve our margins going forward.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Okay, the other question was about these biopharma companies and potential partnerships. Well, I think it's -- we have already the infrastructure, also the reach to customers. And we have developed, over time, a very strong model in terms of direct sales to customers. And we are convinced that this model also can benefit smaller companies that will have maybe problems that will be covering and managing [ph] the market, but without the infrastructure to reach customers. So we will consider this kind of partnership with these companies.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I think you mentioned on the call that your parasiticide class within companion animal saw some pressure in the quarter. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Did it actually decline? And if so, maybe you could quantify it? And do you have anything in your pipeline that might cause this trend to be able to reverse in the coming year or so?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Well, our parasiticide franchise in companion animal didn't decline in the quarter, but the growth was affected by the entrance of new competitors. There have been 2 new competitors launching new parasiticides, oral parasiticides, and we have seen that the market dynamics in parasiticides are changing, and moving from the traditional parasiticides that there were topical to more attention to oral parasiticides. We also have programs in this area and we expect to launch these products, oral parasiticides for companion animals, in the future.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Erin Wilson in for Bob. Follow up to the SG&A expense question and the leverage of that metric going forward. What can be addressed or corrected near term or can be considered one-time in nature? And outside of some of those items, can you call out where you have made progress on this line as it relates to your separation from Pfizer? And I guess the second question then, similar would be -- can you just speak to the competition in U.S. companion animal in light of the increased promotional spending that you've called out. Why is it such a light trend in companion animal?", "Glenn David", "Sure. So in terms of the SG&A and items that might be considered one-time in nature, I think the key item is what we've been highlighting in terms of the buildup of our corporate enabling functions and the timing of which that ramped up and when those costs were most debited in the P&L. So in 2013, in the first half of the year, we were not running at our full cost base for our enabling functions and that corrected in the second half, and that's driving the difficulty in comparison year-over-year. Some of the areas that you have seen have significant improvement though year-over-year, I think when you look at the growth in our regions and our segments, you've seen very strong IBT growth or income growth in those regions, demonstrating continued focus on managing -- or on our expenses.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Maybe a comment on the competition in the U.S. and also details on the promotional activities that we conducted in the second quarter. Definitely, as I said during my remarks and also the remarks of Glenn, we have seen introduction of new parasiticides, also introduction of new vaccines and the introduction of generic competition to a product which is important in our portfolio, which is RIMADYL. And in terms of the additional investment in promotional activities in the quarter, I think it's only a question of pacing. If you take year-to-date, you would see that the investment in the year has been in line with our projections of growing promotional activities below the growth in terms of revenues.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.", "Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Christopher Benassi on behalf of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Since the IPO, investors have believed in the story of continued improvement in Zoetis' margins. However, we are curious as to where you might see room for further margin improvement, possibly in SG&A, R&D or maybe even across the board.", "Glenn David", "In terms of where we see continued improvement. So R&D, I think, is one item that you've highlighted. We've seen growth in R&D that's been sort of in the low-single digits, while we still continue to be very effective with our R&D productivity. From an SG&A perspective, as well as a cost of goods perspective, we do continue to see areas for improvement. So as I mentioned, SG&A, we do expect to grow in line with inflation. And cost of goods, we're clearly focused on continuing to find areas to improve our cost of goods and expect incremental improvements in COGS going forward.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Taylor with CL King.", "Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "I just had a couple of questions related to the PEDv vaccine you have in development. But for a conditional approval, what kind of efficacy data do you have to present to the regulators to receive a conditional approval? And I also wondered how much does a conditional approval limit appeal or uptake of this product once it does reach the market?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So in terms of the regulatory requirements for conditional approval for a vaccine, so we need to demonstrate safety of the vaccine and also efficacy in certain conditions. And the requirements for efficacy for a conditional license are lower than the efficacy requirements for a full license. In terms of the selling opportunities of a vaccine under conditional approval, I think it's something that, since the vaccine, in this case, will be responding to a real market need, we don't see that this will create any limitations. There will be some limitations in terms of promotional activities, but not limitations in terms of selling the product to the market.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "We now have a follow-up from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Following up on the PEDv comments, I'm just wondering, Juan Ram\u00f3n, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how hog farmers are growing larger animals, even though we've seen, I guess, some pressure on the herd sizes. And I'm just wondering if your new product, ENGAIN, is helping to -- if you've seen some good uptake because of this? And if you could quantify that also? And then Glenn David, the tax rate was lower on a year-over-year basis. Just wondering what we could expect? And I also wanted to clarify, did you say your tax guidance does not include the R&D tax credits?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "The follow-up question on PEDv, so definitely, ENGAIN, it's helping producers to have a more efficiency in terms of food. So they are reaching feed efficiencies because of this product. This product is also a product that already exists in the market, it's ractopamine. And we think that the product that are released [ph] in the market, together with ENGAIN, is helping the producers to achieve the targeted weight, with lowered cost in terms of food.", "Glenn David", "And in terms of the tax rates. So the tax rate was lower in the quarter at 28.4%. We have reaffirmed our guidance of approximately 29% for the year, and we still believe the full year is the best view of our overall tax rate. And just to emphasize it, that does not include the R&D tax credit, which would lower our rate by approximately 50 basis points.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "Next we have a follow-up from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "This is Erin again. A quick follow-up. There has been some recent changes, or recently announced upcoming changes, in the companion animal diagnostics market in the U.S., with IDEXX Laboratories moving to a direct distribution model. Do you see this as an opportunity for you? What -- and just generally speaking, what is your underlying growth rate for your diagnostics business?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So we remain committed to diagnostics. We see diagnostics as very complementary to our current business, in both R&D and also commercial. And we are trying to build our portfolio in terms of diagnostics. And the change on IDEXX in terms of direct model, it's something that we will not comment on the strategy of our competitors, but definitely, we'll explore any opportunity that will further penetrate our diagnostic depth into the market.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, next question, please?", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to a follow-up from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Sorry if you addressed this earlier, had to hop off for a minute. But what can we expect for your November Investor Day? If you could just frame that for us. Can we look for something like a 5-year outlook? If you could just give us more color as to what we can see from you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So we're working on the details of the agenda that we will communicate to you in the near future. So one of the objectives that we have during this day is to provide much more details on our strategy. Also have the opportunity to provide this information in terms of commercial, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of R&D, from members of my leadership team, that will go into some detail that may have not been provided until now. And in terms of the outlook, we are considering what should be the details that we will provide in terms of the outlook, and we are still considering different timeframes that will be information that we'll be sharing with you at that time. The other objective is also to go into some additional details on the animal healthcare market, to have much more clarity in terms of projections of the market and also the opportunities for both livestock and companion animals.", "John O'Connor", "Operator, are there any other questions?", "Operator", "At this time, there are no additional phone questions.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Well with that, thank you very much for joining us today. Thank you very much for your interest in Zoetis, and we -- I look forward for more interactions with you. I definitely hope to see you at our Investor Day in November 18.

Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.", "I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ram\u00f3n and Paul will provide an overview of our quarterly results, and then we will open the call for your questions.", "Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of the slides used today will also be available on the website following the call.", "Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on form 10-Q.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, such as the nonrecurring costs of becoming a standalone public company.", "A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 4, 2014. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "I also want to remind you that beginning with the first quarter, we realigned our segment reporting with respect to our Client Supply Services organization or CSS, which provides contract manufacturing services for third parties. The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within Other business activities, separate from the 4 reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, John. And thank you to those joining today's call. Before beginning my comments on our third quarter performance, I would like to introduce Paul Herendeen. Paul joined Zoetis as our new CFO this past September to lead the company's finance and information technology organizations, in addition to being part of the Zoetis executive team.", "I'm delighted that Paul has joined Zoetis and is on the call today. Later, he will speak with you as we review the details of our third quarter performance.", "A key element of our long-term value proposition is our ability to grow in line or faster than the market. Based on most recent data, Zoetis continues to grow faster than the animal health industry. Over the trailing 12 months ending with the second quarter, the animal health market grew by 3% according to industry sources, while Zoetis grew by 5% with both percentages, including the negative impact of foreign exchange.", "Our ability to grow faster than the animal health market illustrates the fundamental strength of our business model. With the broadest product portfolio in the industry, the steady introduction of new products and our top-ranked field force, we are able to bring value solutions to veterinarians and livestock producers around the world.", "Now, let's turn to our operational performance during the most recent quarter. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 10% in revenue and 21% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41. Revenue growth during the quarter was strong in all regions and in both developed and emerging markets, with emerging markets delivering double-digit growth. These are result of favorable market conditions, the strength of our diverse product portfolio and the diversity of our global presence.", "Let me now comment on our livestock performance. In livestock, we grew 13% and growth was strong across all geographic segments. Producers are enjoying favorable market conditions in many parts of the world with high meat and milk prices, together with lower feed cost.", "On a global basis, the outlook for meat and daily proteins remains strong. A growing middle-class in China, India and other emerging markets continues to drive growth in worldwide demand for meat, eggs and daily proteins.", "Let's now take a closer look at our third quarter performance by species, starting with cattle. Cattle is our largest species and it grew 13% with all regions delivering strong growth. In the United States, we saw strong demand for our premium products, while we also generated gains gains in market share. Swine revenues grew 17% despite the challenge of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus or PEDv in a number of countries. All regions contributed to this growth and we continue to expand our swine product portfolio through the introduction of vaccines with new antigen combinations as well as registering and commercializing products in new markets. Poultry revenue grew 7% with strong contributions from the emerging markets within the European, Africa and Middle East region.", "Now, turning to companion animal. Companion animal grew by 5%, aided by sales of APOQUEL in the U.S. and several European countries. Strong growth of key brands in the U.S. and Europe was offset by the introduction of new products from competitors and the impact of the solution changes in Japan. While competition has affected our results in parasiticides and vaccines, we are confident in our ability to participate in this and other growing market segments as we introduce innovative products to the market.", "For example, we are preparing for European launch in 2015 of Versican Plus, a new line of canine vaccines. We will cover -- I will cover Versican Plus in more details when I discuss new products and milestones.", "We can also confirm that in April 2015, we expect to significantly increase APOQUEL supply. With greater supply, we expect to begin offering APOQUEL to new customers. We continue to receive very positive feedback from customers about this product. And based on current market conditions, we believe APOQUEL can achieve annual sales of approximately $200 million to $300 million at peak sales, which normally is 5 years after product introduction.", "Now, I would like to share with you several products and milestones that illustrate how our singular focus on animal health and our core capabilities allow us to put our customers first and bring our solutions to their most pressing animal health needs.", "Earlier in the quarter, we announced that we obtained a conditional license in the United states for our vaccine to help fight PEDv in pigs. Under a conditional license, we demonstrate safety in a field study and provide reasonable expectations of efficacy. We are now conducting additional studies to demonstrate efficacy and to obtain a full license from the USDA. The PEDv vaccine has been received very positively by swine customers and is available to them ahead of the cold weather when the virus is more likely to spread. We were able to bring this vaccine to market in only 14 months by leveraging our 3 interconnected capabilities.", "Our R&D capability and the expertise in biologics allow us to fast-track the development of PEDv vaccine. Manufacturing and scale-up capability enable us to produce enough of the vaccine to meet projected customer demand. And now that the product has been launched, Zoetis representatives and our field veterinarians are partnering with our customers on how to incorporate the new vaccine into their protocols and biosecurity programs. The development of these vaccine is an example of how we leverage our capabilities to bring solutions to our customers.", "This past quarter, Zoetis also received a full license for the first poultry vaccine targeting Georgia 08 type IBV. The full license followed the USDA conditional license that Zoetis received in late 2013. These are the first commercially vaccine to help reduce disease cause by the virus strain.", "In our companion animal business, we received European approval for Versican Plus. This is a combination canine vaccine that provides unmatched leptospira protection as well as a greater convenience and flexibility for veterinarians. It provides protection against obtained bacterial and viral infections in one vaccine dose. By offering multiple vaccine combinations, Versican Plus provides a comprehensive solution for European markets that accommodates a broad range of vaccination protocols. We are now preparing the launch of Versican Plus in the European Union in 2015.", "Also, we announced the formation of a new collaboration with Easter Bush Research Consortium that is focused on combating emerging infectious diseases in Europe. Zoetis will partner with others in this consortium to detect and identify emerging infectious diseases early and to develop medicines and vaccines to treat and control them.", "Zoetis is the only animal health company in this consortium. Collaboration like this one contributes to our ability to be first to know about emerging infectious diseases and aspires to be first to market with new products to diagnose and prevent diseases.", "And before I ask Paul to walk us through the financials and provide details on our 2014 guidance, I would like to remind you of our upcoming Investor Day. We are very pleased to be hosting an investor meeting on November 18 at the New York Stock Exchange. The goal of the meeting is to enhance understanding of the animal health industry, the key drivers of Zoetis market leadership and the strategies for future growth. I will be joined by the Zoetis executive team for a discussion of our regional businesses, R&D approach, manufacturing and supply chain operations and financial goals.", "And with that, Paul?", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning. It's been a very busy and productive first 2 months and I'd like to say that the more I learn, the more confident I am that the fundamentals of our industry, our team here at Zoetis and the strengths of our capabilities provide us with the opportunity to create value for our stakeholders. I'll speak more about all this in 2 weeks at our Investor Day, but now let me dive in and review the third quarter a little more deeply and to discuss our guidance for 2014.", "Turning first to the interest income statement slide. For the third quarter, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year on both a reported and operational basis. Reported net income was $166 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the third quarter, an increase of 27%. And adjusted net income was $207 million or $0.41 per diluted share, representing reported growth of 20% and 21%, respectively.", "Adjusted net income from the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $41 million or $0.08 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, the majority of which were related to standup costs.", "Now, let's take a minute to discuss currencies. In the third quarter, foreign exchange did not have a material impact on our revenue or income growth. It's important to remember that our 3 international business segments have an earlier quarter close than the U.S. segment. The third quarter for the international segments closed at the end of August with the U.S. segment closing at the end of September.", "Looking ahead, we expect to see a negative impact on revenue growth in the range of 250 to 300 basis points in the fourth quarter based on current rates and we expect to see similar magnitude of impact in 2015.", "Now let's turn to our adjusted income statement slide, which I'll discuss on an operational basis. Again, because FX was not a significant factor in the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 10%, the same as reported. Livestock comprised 65% of sales in the quarter and grew $88 million or 13% operationally. Companion animal comprised 34% of sales in the quarter and grew $20 million or 5% operationally. Adjusted cost of sales was 35.5% of revenue versus 34.7% in the year-ago quarter. And that's due to the buildup of central manufacturing supply chain operations. This buildup was completed by the end of 2013 and those higher costs are now flowing through our cost of goods sold.", "Adjusted SG&A, meanwhile, increased by 2% operationally in the third quarter. In other items, adjusted R&D expense was flat operationally and interest expense was flat at $29 million in the quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 28.3%. I would not read too much into our tax rate in the quarter. What's important is that we expect our rate for the full year 2014 to be consistent with our guidance, which is approximately 29%. And again, our adjusted net income was $207 million, representing a growth of 20% or 21% operationally.", "Now let me talk for a minute about how we're tracking year-to-date on a few elements. This was a great quarter, but we always want to keep in mind the full year and that's because of the nature of our business, the cycles in the animal health industry and fluctuations in currencies in any given year.", "In looking at any quarter relative to the prior year, lot of noise can creep in. The longer the time period you look at, the more that noise cancels itself out and you can see a clearer picture of the underlying trends in our business. We focus on full calendar years and do not guide or manage to quarterly results. While it feels great to put a quarter on the board with such strong revenue and profit growth, the bigger picture is that we are on track to deliver on our guidance for the full year. That said, let's take a quick look at the 9 months year-to-date and compare that back to 2013.", "We're tracking in line with our revenue expectations for the first 9 months, growing revenue 6% on an operational basis. Our guidance range implies full year 2014 operational growth of 5% to 6%. Our adjusted cost of sales is at 34.9% of revenue on a year-to-date basis. As I said earlier, we continue to expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue for the year, bringing us in line with the full year guidance of approximately 35.5% of revenue. And finally, adjusted net income is also performing in line with our expectations growing at 13% on an operational basis year-to-date. This year-to-date performances are in ranges that are consistent with our expectations, and I'll discuss the implications on our full year guidance in a moment.", "Now let's turn to our operating segment results. Again, I'll discuss these on an operational basis, but I -- but it should be noted that the segment earnings are on a pretax basis and are presented on an adjusted basis.", "Beginning with the U.S. Third quarter revenue was $532 million, an increase of 7%. Sales of livestock products grew 12% with cattle and swine as the main contributors. Growth in cattle products benefited from higher demand for our premium product as producers continue to see strong market conditions. With higher prices for beef and lower input costs, producers are moving lighter animals into feed lots sooner to meet the market opportunity. These cattle can be more vulnerable to illness and disease, given their age and weight, and require more use of medicines and vaccines to maintain their health.", "These market conditions also mean our customers place more importance on using our premium products to protect animals and investments. Meanwhile, swine products sales were driven primarily by the success of several recent new product introductions such as our Fostera PCV M. hyo combination vaccine. The DRAXXIN 25 anti-infective product for swine and our ENGAIN ractopamine product for use in feed. This growth in swine was slightly offset by the continuing impact of PEDv, which Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned.", "In companion animal products, we generated an operational growth of 2%, driven by APOQUEL and other key brands such as ProHeart 6, Cerenia and Convenia. This growth was offset, however, by increased competition in vaccines, pain products and parasiticides.", "In summary, the U.S. segment earnings increased by 10% based on the quarter's strong sales and lower expenses.", "Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region or EuAfME. Revenue in EuAfME was $293 million, an increase of 12% operationally compared to the third quarter of 2013. The growth was a combination of double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Sales of our livestock products increased 13% operationally as the region delivered positive results in France and the U.K., as well as in emerging markets.", "The livestock growth was driven by increased sales across all species with particular advances coming from cattle and poultry products. In France for example, we saw an increase in the sales of the anti-infectives as customers sought to buy product ahead of more restrictive legislative changes. And in the U.K., we saw strong demand for cattle products. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products increased 11% operationally, primarily driven by sales of APOQUEL in Germany and the U.K. as well as growth in parasiticides such as the Stronghold brand.", "EuAfME segment earnings increased 28% operationally, primarily due to the revenue increase, improved gross margins and lower operating expenses in the quarter.", "Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR. Third quarter revenue was $194 million, an increase of 17% operationally compared to the third quarter 2013. In this region, we saw a significant growth in emerging markets such as Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina and also in Canada.", "Overall for the segment, sales of livestock products grew 16% operationally and sales of companion animal products grew 19% operationally. Sales in Venezuela and Argentina grew significantly across all species. In Brazil, there was significant growth driven primarily by sales of cattle products, including new product launches and growth in key companion animal brands such as Vanguard, Cerenia, Revolution and Convenia, as this market continues to expand at a high rate.", "Meanwhile, growth in Canada was primarily driven by sales of companion animal products. This was the result of a later spring season than last year, which had a positive impact on parasiticides sales -- the growth of parasiticides sales for this quarter as compared to last year quarter. Strong volumes in cattle and swine products also contributed to growth in Canada.", "CLAR segment earnings increased 19% on an operational basis, driven by revenue growth, limited growth in operating expenses and partially offset by a decline in gross margin.", "In Asia Pacific or APAC, third quarter sales were $179 million, an increase of 7% operationally compared to the third quarter 2013. Sales of our livestock products grew 9% operationally, driven primarily by sales of cattle products in Australia and growth in Southeast Asia from recently launched swine products. In Australia, we are seeing more cattle moving into feed lots and requiring more treatment as Australia continues see the impact of drought on its cattle businesses.", "In the swine, we continue to see strong sales driven primarily by an increase in sales of our vaccine portfolio. Sales of companion animal products, however, were flat operationally due to an inventory buyback related to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Excluding this event, operational growth would have been 8% driven by sales of parasiticides, equine vaccines in Australia and increased sales of vaccines in China.", "APAC segment operating earnings increased 24% due to revenue growth, improvements in gross margin and a decline in operating expenses. That's on an operational basis.", "Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we think about and manage our business in an annual basis and not quarterly. There can be a lot of variability in any individual quarter. For example, in revenue, the variability can be to due to changes in weather patterns or seasonality be associated with certain product lines. In R&D expenses, for example, the quarter -- quarterly variability may be based on project schedules and conditions needed to complete field trials. Our R&D expense, for example, tends to be heaviest in the fourth quarter.", "Over a full year, that variability, which you have seen in pockets this year, historically evens out, and we are able to deliver a steady and predictable performance when measured on an annual basis. We remain confident on our ability to deliver on our full year guidance for 2014 and we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share for the full year and narrowing our revenue guidance towards the high end of the range.", "We now expect reported revenue of approximately $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. This guidance would imply full year reported growth of 3% to 4% for revenue and includes a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign currency. This also implies an operational growth of 1% to 5% in the fourth quarter, and that's when compared with a strong fourth quarter in 2013. After taking into consideration the current FX environment, reported revenue growth could be 250 to 300 basis points below the operational growth rate in Q4.", "Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for the full year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost savings efforts, which is forecast to be offset by the full year impact of costs incurred to build our central manufacturing and supply functions as well as unfavorable mix. We understand this implies our fourth quarter cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue will be higher than what you've seen to date. However, we believe our 2014 full year guidance of approximately 35.5% of revenue is a better reflection of our underlying cost of goods sold.", "Adjusted SG&A expenses are now expected to be between $1.46 billion and $1.48 billion. We continue to see good OpEx discipline in the regions, which is helping to mitigate increased spending in our general and administrative functions, where we continue to build out the infrastructure to support our business on a fully standalone basis.", "Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $385 million and $395 million. We continue to deploy resources responsibly in R&D as this investment is fundamental to the enhancement and protection of our existing portfolio through life cycle developments and the development of innovative new products to help fuel additional growth.", "We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29%. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. And we continue to expect adjusted EPS of between $1.50 and $1.54 per share for the full year. This guidance would imply full year reported growth of 6% to 9% for adjusted EPS and reflects a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points coming from foreign currencies.", "Please note that our guidance does not reflect any further currency devaluation in Venezuela. Separately, we now estimate pretax charges for 2014 of between $180 million and $195 million, primarily related to standup costs and acquisition-related costs. These charges are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for our reported diluted EPS for the full year 2014 remains between $1.16 and $1.20 per share. This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving animal health market for the remainder of the year.", "To sum up the quarter, we had a very strong revenue and earnings growth quarter in all regions, demonstrating the strength of our business model. We demonstrated an ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional segments while continuing to absorb some of the impact of the buildup costs associated with our corporate functions. We saw no material impact from foreign currency on our growth this quarter, but anticipate more significant effects on our future results. And we are reaffirming our guidance for the year despite the expected currency headwinds in Q4.", "That concludes my prepared remarks. And now we will open the line for questions. John?", "John O'Connor", "Thank you Paul. Operator, we are ready to take the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.", "Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then, Paul, congrats on the new role. Two questions here. First, can you elaborate on the U.S. companion business and competitive dynamics there? I think last quarter you mentioned you were increasing some of your promotional investments. I guess, any sign that those investments are having any impact? Or just when should we think about that business starting to maybe turn around a little bit more? And then a question for Paul, just as you're stepping into the CFO role, can you just elaborate a little bit more on your priorities? I guess, specifically, what are the biggest opportunities you see at Zoetis when you look at the company's margins, tax rate and capital structure?", "Operator", "It appears that the -- we're experiencing technical difficulties at this time. Please standby.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "I hope now the line is fine and I will be able to answer your questions, Chris.", "Operator", "Sir, you may now proceed with your answer.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Okay. So Chris, it's Juan Ram\u00f3n and I will answer the question on U.S. companion animal dynamics. So there are different factors driving the market in the U.S. in companion animal. The introduction of new products, mainly in parasiticides. The market is moving more to oral parasiticides compared to the previous, more topical ones with the introduction of 2 main competitors in this market. And we are participating in the market in the topical, but not on the oral. The other change that we have seen is that the introduction of new vaccines in the U.S. that also they are impacting our performance. And finally, in the pain market in where we participate with RIMADYL a very strong brand, there are also new factors affecting our performance. One, it's a competitor that was out of the market in 2012. It was back in '13 and now it's full revenues and also made it part of the shares that we gained when this competitor was not participating in this market. It's now back to the more normal situation. And also, the introduction of generic competition for RIMADYL on the chewable formulation, although this have not been representing a significant impact so far. Now, I will ask Paul to answer your question.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes, thanks, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and Chris, thanks for the questions. Yes, I've been here about 60 days now. I'll tell you that my -- the first thing I see is an opportunity or I say, more as a priority for me is to help us to get complete with the standup process. Until we get through that, I think that it's going to somewhat mask our company's cash flow generation capabilities because it, obviously, while it doesn't affect adjusted net income, it obviously is a cash flow item. And so in terms of priority, both getting us past those -- that standup activity and getting the G&A infrastructure built to the point where it can support this global business has kind of been very, very high on my list. Now that said, I mean walking down through the income statement, there are opportunities for us to continue to drive operating margin improvements over time, and I think these are themes that you've heard from the other members of the team as we go -- as you go back. I mean, we've got very good expense control in our commercial groups. That's been a little bit masked by the buildup of cost in G&A. And again, once we get through that, we'll get to more of a normalized run rate for our OpEx.", "There are opportunities in the gross profit margin when we look at ability to continually benefit from price increases. Second, from improvements in efficiency in our plant network structure. And those are things that although they will happen here in the near term, I think that it will take us some time to generate the most meaningful portion of those margin expansion opportunities.", "Part of your question was around the tax rate. We -- when we spun out from Pfizer, we started with a tax rate kind of -- or we could have had a tax rate sort of in the 40% range. We were able to put together a structure or put in place a structure that enables us to have that tax rate down in the neighborhood of about 29%. So good from the perspective of a structure that allows us to have a much lower tax rate. Thinking ahead, I think that our ability to manage that tax rate is based on opportunities to present themselves to us that fit within our structure. I would not expect to see revolutionary changes in our tax rate, although we will do our level best to manage that tax rate down over time. And I think your last question was around capital structure. In this company, we are -- we have expressed that we wanted to maintain a level of debt in our cap structure. I think you certainly know me from my prior employer and -- I like debt, we like debt. There's a role for debt in our capital structure. We've expressed a target of 2.5x trailing 12 months' EBITDA. That's an appropriate debt load, but I will say that's a target. It's a target, where if there were an opportunity in the call -- we were called upon to lever up a little bit, we would do that, and then we would endeavor to reduce our debt over time back towards the target. And I'll stop there. Can I get the next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "First one, Ram\u00f3n, could you give us a little update on the competitive landscape. Sentinel Spectrum went to a competitor, wondering what your thoughts are? And also you talked about oral parasiticides, just wondering what's on the horizon for your product portfolio? And then for Paul, you've been with the company now for only a couple of months. Congratulations again. I'm sure it's been like drinking from a firehose, but just wondering if you could give us your puts and takes from when you decided to join the company until now. And also an update on the inventory issue in Japan with the distributor.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Kevin. And I will answer the questions on Sentinel and oral parasiticides. Well, definitely as a leader in this industry, we see any transaction or any potential transaction in the market and also we are active assessing any opportunity. And definitely, Sentinel was an opportunity that we explored. And what -- as you see, we decided not to participate in this transaction. And we talked about what our programs or plan on oral parasiticides. Definitely, we see oral parasiticides an important part of preventing animals, dogs and cats against ticks and fleas and also heartworm. And we -- I would like to postpone the details of my answer to the Investor Day in -- when we have the opportunity to provide, to investors and to analysts, a more comprehensive view of our R&D approach and also some of the areas in where we are investing.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "And I'll pick -- Kevin, pick up from there. It's Paul. Your question was around puts and takes from prior to joining. So I've here, it's almost exactly 60 days, I think. As of today, it's 61 days. When I first looked at the opportunity, I think the thing that attracted me to it was, first looking at the industry, an industry that -- a global industry that grows consistently over time. So solid underlying macro trends. And then you look at the company, Zoetis. Here's the company that's a market leader with a broad portfolio, very durable revenue streams and remember, from my experience at Warner Chilcott, we sort of had the opposite of the durable revenue streams. Everybody was always concerned. And I looked at this and said, \"Here's a company that has the opportunity to put consistent, revenue growth on the board by levering its broad portfolio and driving growth of those assets through application of sales force.\" It's very similar to what I was used to at Warner Chilcott, and also supporting those brands through productive R&D, both in terms of extending product life cycles, in terms of providing fuel to allow the sales forces to grow the overall revenue base and lastly, to add those truly innovative products that give you the opportunity to step up and accelerate your growth. So I look at this as being kind of a similar economic model to the pharma business, but with those important differences of longer duration, revenue streams, less reliance on IP. It's about the brands. Same levers to drive the business that's using your field sales resources, face-to-face with your customers to go out and drive revenue and then lastly, supporting that portfolio through productive investment in R&D. And I'd say that, that was my analysis coming in and 61 days later, I think this is a terrific company. And what I've been most impressed with is the ability of the company to execute consistently and drive revenue that exceeds the overall market growth. It's been quite an interesting couple of months here. And again, the most important thing was we've got a great team here that knows how to drive this business. I'll stop there. I'm sorry, you had a question about inventory in Japan. That was related to the termination of a distributor agreement. It's kind of a normal course. It came to the end and we were called upon to buy back some inventory, and that's what's going on there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.", "Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. Specifically on the outlook for gross margins. I mean, Paul, you talked about gross margins getting hit in the fourth quarter. I imagine that's largely due to FX. But in light of global pricing pressure, maybe, Juan, you can touch upon that in terms of what you are seeing across all your different geographies. But in light of that competitive dynamic, how do you see the outlook for gross margins? Do you think that gross margins can expand in 2015, in 2016? Or should we assume that pricing pressures would offset volume growth and cost cutting or slimming down the manufacturing. But if you could just talk to, number one, pricing, global pricing pressures; and number two, impact on gross margins? And the other question was -- to Paul, was there any channel loading in front of the new vaccine launches? And Paul, congratulations on what sounds like a terrific opportunity for you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Jami. And we see -- we continue seeing opportunities of applying price increases across all geographies in where we operate. Definitely in 2014, we had been increasing prices in the U.S., also in Europe, in Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We also apply quite an aggressive approach in some markets with high inflation rates, and this is something that we have seeing a positive impact in our revenues also because of these price [indiscernible]. In terms of the expansion of gross margin, definitely, we'll have the opportunity to cover that in our Investor Day and we'll provide more details on what can be our objective for the future. And maybe I would like to delay this -- well, the details until this Investor Day. And maybe -- and the last comment on the channel loading. So we're not loading the channel and this is something that -- the vaccine launches will be next year. And normally, we apply a very strict procedures to avoid -- that we are increasing inventory that is not needed to meet customer demands.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Jami, it's Paul. I think you had a question regarding Q4 margin and so I want to make sure I address that because it's an important point. It's an FX impact. Yes, there's FX impact in -- across all of our line items through our P&L. However, it's -- the main reason for the expected increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in Q4 is related to the timing of increased headquarters cost, which are flowing through our cost of goods sold in the second half of 2014. And I wasn't here when the folks articulated that, but I think that they provided some guidance that you should expect the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue to rise as the year went on. But that the guidance range, which is -- well, actually the guidance level, which is I think the important statistic is, we do expect to be in line with our guidance for the full year, which was 35.5%. I think broadly, looking ahead without providing guidance, I think we have the opportunity to absorb those increased HQ costs in 2015 and beyond without having it have a deleterious effect on our margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Regarding your Investor Day, you said that we're going to see some financial targets. I just want to clarify, are we going to -- are you going to provide some sort of medium to long-range guidance or targets beyond 2015? And the follow-up, there had been a lot of reports about potential buyers for your business. Obviously, in 2015 -- after June 2015, this will become more of a factor. Just could you comment on your overall strategic view about how relevant is that for you? How would you evaluate such opportunity? And just give us an overall sense of how you would think about that. Obviously, in the second half of next year, there's going to be a lot of focus on that. So how should we think about your position on potential -- on being a target of a potential acquisition?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Okay. Let me ask Paul to answer this question.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Sure. I'll start with the Investor Day. We will provide a look, of course, what I'll call our normal sort of guidance look at 2015. And in addition, we will provide our thoughts around 2016 and 2017, not in the same level of detail, but in a way that would enable the market in large to get their arms around what our expectations are for the next several years. With respect to the second question?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "And I think it's -- we cannot really respond on other company's strategy. We think we have a solid business that we can provide significant value to our shareholders. We are showing that we are meeting our objective in terms of revenues, in terms of adjusted net income and we are also, very important, growing faster than the market. So all this, in my opinion, is showing that this company is well managed. We also have a significant generation of cash over time, and then this will be additional opportunity for investors.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Paul, I think you said your first priority was to kind of focus on the stand-up activities. Can you just elaborate on what's still left to do on that front? And second question, I believe you guys have said previously that you expect about maybe 20 basis points of manufacturing cost headwind as we move into '15. Is that still a decent expectation?", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Sure, and it's Paul. First, the primary task that remains to be completed is the completion of the implementation of a global ERP system, where we're installing SAP. It's very important to us to have that backbone for our company to support our decision-making and the management of our business on a global basis, number one. It's also important to us because it's important that we stand on our own away from Pfizer. So that is a top priority for me now. And that it's not just the implementation, it's also the build-out of the team. We call it Business Technology, so BT, but obviously the more familiar IT acronym. We're continuing to build out that function here in headquarters to support our business. And so that is the primary area where we continue to have some work to stand alone, away and apart from Pfizer. Second, with respect to the manufacturing headwind, I mean, you'll recall that we have an agreement with -- a supply agreement with Pfizer, which has some increases in cost that we need to absorb. I think we're doing a good job of wringing efficiencies out of our manufacturing process that have enabled us to offset a solid part of those increases that are in that contract. We're not going to provide guidance today on what it looks like into 2015, but I'll just give you the factoids that you should keep in your head: We have the opportunity to pull the price lever; we have the opportunity to manage our global supply chain and drive better efficiency; and there's always a favorable mix to the extent that our higher-margin product lines provide more of our overall revenue base. So I would say, yes, we're always facing headwinds -- or we are facing some headwinds looking into '15, but those are challenges that we have a solid opportunity to overcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Guggenheim.", "Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I have a few. So first question for Paul is since you've joined Zoetis, what are some new initiatives that you plan to implement at the company that could help drive earnings well above the sort of the $2 per share mark? And then secondly, as a company, do you have any interest in companion animal oncology or biologic drugs? As you know, a lot of smaller companies develop these products. I'm just wondering if that's true -- truly good opportunity or not. And then lastly just on APOQUEL, is there any way you can quantify what sales would've been in '14 had you had enough supply? And then in '15, how should we think about the sales ramp? I know you had said $200 million to $300 million in peak sales over, normally, a 5-year time frame, but could you get there faster?", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes, thanks, Louise. It's Paul. I'll take the first part of that. New initiatives to drive growth. Let's say the new initiatives, I get to step behind others who are already activating those sorts of strategies in order to drive longer-term growth, but as -- just referencing back to my past life, the similar sorts of levers that you would expect me to pull, and those include focus on value-generative business development activity. That would include using our existing tax structure to manage that tax rate in a downward direction. I think the things that I focus on also are the active management of our capital structure and thinking about ways that we can deliver value to our stakeholders really across-the-board, both from operations and from the management of our cap structure. So those are the initiatives that I've had. And then the second question was in companion animal?", "Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Yes, just curious if you think the oncology or biologics opportunities that some of the smaller companies are pursuing are actually real opportunities. Because I haven't seen the larger companies go after that, so just kind of curious.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "I would take this question and let me say that in oncology, Zoetis was the first company launching a product that was fully developed to treat cancer for dogs. And this product was Palladia that we launched 2 or 3 years ago. So within that oncology, it's important in companion animal. It's, today, in many cases, veterinarians are still using products developed for human to treat cancer in dogs or cats. But we think that in the future, maybe there will be new products that will be better targeted for treating these kind of diseases in companion animal. And definitely, we will be assessing these opportunity and considering the internal or external opportunities to complement our portfolio. In terms of bios, I think it has been a key area for Zoetis. We have a very strong portfolio in both companion animal and livestock and we'll continue investing in bringing new products to our portfolio and also to strengthening our offer to our customers. And then finally on APOQUEL, so in 2014, we have communicated that our revenues will be around 1% of our total revenues and this has been because of the limitations in terms of product supply. Speculating how much will be the sales of APOQUEL with -- under restricted supply probably is not adding too much value. So what I think, in my opinion, it's -- important is that for 2015, we expect to generate more than $100 million in revenues and we expect definitely to generate these revenues, basically on that 9 months of full supply because we expect to have this product available to more customers from April. So you can -- that's why we are now communicating that we expect that this product has the potential of $200 million to $300 million at peak sales.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Douglas Tsao of Barclays.", "Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just to start, I think I'm trying to understand and I've got some questions trying to understand sort of the sequential guidance in terms of revenue. Obviously, they were really strong this last quarter. If I look at your historical seasonality, 4Q seems to be up a little -- to be up pretty meaningfully from 3Q. So just understanding some of those dynamics, as we move into the fourth quarter, that we should be aware of. And certainly the FX guidance seems to be a little bit more extreme than I would've expected. And then the other question is on terms of the PEDv vaccine. Just perhaps you can provide some perspective on how big an opportunity that can be for you and sort of the timing of that sort of coming -- or sort of the revenue sort of building on that product line because, obviously, very impressive how quickly you were able to get a product approved and to market.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes, it's Paul. I'll take the fourth quarter. And how do you get there? I mean, we have 3 quarters on the board. So the year-to-date number is on the board. We have guidance. You can do the math and see what it implies with respect to revenue growth in the fourth quarter that's implied by that. Midpoint of the range, it's -- from a reported basis, it's sort of flattish and we did state that there's about a 250- to 300-basis-point negative impact to our revenues in Q4 versus Q4 of 2013. So fairly significant FX headwinds. And it does give me the opportunity to say, look, we feel like, from an operational perspective, we have a very strong quarter here and very strong guidance for the full year and that's pretty good when you're facing those sorts of FX headwinds that will -- almost certainly, in fact, I would say certainly will hit us in Q4 '14 compared back to '13. And frankly, as you think ahead to 2015 v '14 you have got to take this into account. For perspective, 45% of our revenue comes from our U.S. So we're U.S. dollar denominated, we're exposed to the euro, the real, Canadian dollar, Aussie dollar, sterling, yen. From the perspective of a U.S. dollar-denominated P&L, all those currencies I mentioned, there's not a lot of good news. There's a lot of headwind there. So we feel like our guidance for the full year and our guidance for Q4 is pretty strong, given that we're facing those headwinds going into -- or going into Q4. I think I'll leave it at that and Juan Ram\u00f3n?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "And I will answer the question on PEDv. And so just to provide a little bit of understanding of the market's potential. So first, this vaccine, it's targeting sows. And then by vaccinating the sows, it's transmitting the immunity to the piglet. So the number of sows in the U.S. is a little bit less of 6 million compared to 100 million of pigs of the total market. You see that the potential is related to the number of animals that will get this vaccine. That will be less than 6 million. The second fact that is also important is that we obtained a conditional license. Under the conditional license, we have some limitations in terms of the promotions. Actually, we can go to the customers and work with them to ensure protection for the sow, but there are some limitations in terms of promotion. What is important here is not the size of the revenues, but the confirmation that our business model is working very well. We have very strong capabilities in terms of R&D. Also, we have very strong capabilities in terms of our manufacturing to produce vaccine in a way that it's going to the market very fast. So in our opinion, we are bringing with this vaccine significant value to our customers, that they are facing a significant challenge with this disease, and we are confirming that Zoetis has all the capabilities that are needed to succeed in this industry.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Sorry, it's Paul. I just do want to follow up. The one thing that I didn't say in my remarks about Q4 is also take a look at the quarter you're comparing to back in 2013. Our Q4 was quite strong. If you look at Q -- if you go back to '13 and you look sequentially, Q3 of '13 like $1.1 billion, Q4 '13 $1.254 billion, I think it was -- I've got -- yes, it was a little over $1.2 billion. And so, one is comparing back to last year's Q3, that certainly helped us in putting our good quarter on the board here in Q3 of '14. But that's a tough comparison quarter, Q4 of '13.", "Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And so, Paul, just to clarify, so you don't think that necessarily that step-up of $115 million sequentially is sort of like a normal seasonal trend that we should think about?", "Paul S. Herendeen", "From '13 -- what I'd say is, I want to make this point over and over and over again, is because of the nature of our business and seasonality and how things can shift from September to October or across the month, the best way to look at it is the longest time period that you're comfortable with whether that's a year, a half year, whatever. If you look at the second half of 2014 versus '13, it's a good, solid second half of '14.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI.", "Vlad Nikolenko", "It's actually Vlad Nikolenko sitting in for Mark Schoenebaum. And so the question -- sorry for maybe beating a dead horse. But the question about the Q4, the current full year guidance implies that from Q3 to Q4 of this year, so year -- quarter-by-quarter growth, it's probably going to be a down quarter for revenue and for EPS. So I'm wondering if you can explain that in terms of expenses, what happens in Q4. Is it just seasonal stuff or something else? And in terms of revenue, I understand there will be a huge FX impact, but also just for FX, just to understand how it works for our models, I'm wondering if you can give more color about the type of hedging Zoetis is using for -- both for revenue, for the plan, as well as for EPS.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Okay. Let me -- stay with me here because I want to make sure I understand your question. I think you started by asking about sequentially from Q3 of '14 into Q4 of '14. If you take the midpoint of our range, it would be up in Q4 versus Q3. Okay. So sequentially, I mean, at the midpoint of our range, you would have an increase in revenue Q3 '14 into Q4 '14. The other thing to point out is we talked about the impact in the quarter of the increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, the implied is in the -- is going to be a high percentage and we called that out even in my prepared remarks. So you've got that. Then within SG&A, we typically do spend more towards the back half of the year. That's been a historically observed phenomenon within our business. And certainly within R&D, there is seasonality in our spend there and we talk about sort of the timing of trials that we can do in the field. You need the right conditions in order to be able to do that and the timing of projects, generally, ours have seemed to cluster and have us with more expense in R&D in Q4. You put all of those things together, yes, and then looking at Q4 on a stand-alone basis, yes, you could say, \"Well, gee, the -- against whatever comparator you want to have, whether it's Q3 of '14 or Q4 of '13, it's a tough comparison.\" Again, strong full year expectation for the company. You were looking for reported growth in the neighborhood of 3% to 4% at the top line and that's on an operating basis taking FX out of the mix. Now this is revenue, expecting 5% to 6%. Think of that reported 3% to 4% range as -- but for FX, that's 5% to 6%, which is a very solid full year revenue growth '14 v '13. And I'm sorry, the second question?", "Vlad Nikolenko", "And the second question about the hedging. What type of hedging do you guys use to hedge top line and bottom line, if you do. Hedging instruments, if you're using specific instruments or rely on sort of natural hedging. And if there is natural hedging between regions, what is the delay between -- when the dollar moves or currencies move and the impact that we can see?", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes, a couple of things. I mean, we have natural hedges built in to markets where we have a significant presence because, of course, our costs are denominated in the same currency as our revenue streams. We do not hedge our top line nor our bottom line results. Like most companies, we don't. We are subject to, what they -- the changes in exchange rates. And frankly, if you look at them, again, my favorite phrase, over a long enough period of time, you'll see that those things sort of set -- sort themselves out. Where we do hedge is our net asset exposures in our subsidiaries. So that to the extent that we have risk when those balance sheets are translated, that we can hedge that and keep those costs within a relatively narrow band. We do, do that. Those costs as well as the FX gains or losses, would show up in our other income and deductions line within our P&L.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.", "David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So I have, first, some questions for Juan Ram\u00f3n and then for Paul. So Juan Ram\u00f3n, first, could you just talk about animals moving into feed lots sooner in a little bit more detail on -- specifically what I'm hoping for you to address is how durable that is. So for how many quarters will that be benefiting Zoetis? Second, you've mentioned the APOQUEL revenue for '15 being over $100 million. Could you just help us benchmark that by providing a framework for what revenue you're going to be booking in 2014 for APOQUEL? And then third, for the PEDv vaccine. You mentioned 6 million sows is the opportunity. Could you just tell us the price of the vaccine? And I think it's given twice a year, but just remind us about that as well.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Dave. And you are correct, it's 2x per year, maybe the first time, it's -- it can be an opportunity of 3 vaccines, but then the following years would be 2x. And the price of the PEDv vaccine, it's $7 -- about $7. The treatment choice, 3.5 each vaccine. In terms of APOQUEL for 2014, so we communicated that will be around 1% of our revenue. Our revenue, it's $4.5 billion or $4.7 billion. So we expect that we'll be around $40 million in terms of revenues. And this is only limited because of the supply availability. And then talking about the movement of animals and how long this movement will stay? Well, it depends on the price of the grain. So if the price of the grains are low, so the incentive of moving animals and keeping these animals in the feed lot with significant gains in terms of weight, I think, it will be an opportunity for maintaining this current situation. What we saw in 2014 is even the number of animals moving to the feed lot, maybe it will be slightly lower than the 2013 because they are less animals because they are keeping animals. Also to rebuild the herd, they have been moving animals at a younger age, which are lighter, more vulnerable to infections, more needs of vaccinations. And this has been having a positive impact in our revenues. We expect this situation of younger animals move to the feed lots will stay in the future, in 2015, because the price of feeding the animals remains very low and the profitability and the value of these animals is very high.", "David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's great. And Paul, congrats again. My couple of questions for you are, first, when do you expect to get through the standup costs? Second, what is the FX hit to EPS that you're expecting in the fourth quarter? And then third, if the R&D tax credit is passed, what will the benefit be in the fourth quarter?", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Okay. In -- 2 out of the 3, I can answer. Thanks, David. Well, that question about when we'll be through the standup cost, I would expect to be substantially complete towards the latter part of 2015. Let's say, the end of 2015. We will continue to be flipping switches on our ERP implementation into 2016, but the lion share of the costs should be behind us after the year end 2015. The FX impact on -- at the net income line implied for Q4 is in the range of 100 to 150 basis points negative. And then the last question about the R&D credit in Q4, if it were to be passed, it will have an impact of approximately 50 basis points to the full year rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Holford of Jefferies.", "Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I've got 2 for Paul, please. Firstly just on APOQUEL, just trying to think about contribution margins of this product as it gets towards the peak of $200 million to $300 million, which you just guided. I would assume that this is a very high margin product relative to the rest of the business, something more like a pharmaceutical contribution margin, probably -- possibly 50%, 60% or higher in terms of the operating level, if you can comment around that. And then just secondly, could you tell us if Zoetis has any kind of poison pill type measures as bid defenses? And if not, is the company intending to introduce these into 2015?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "I couldn't get the second question. So it's...", "Paul S. Herendeen", "I'll get the second.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So let me answer the APOQUEL. So our gross margin, has risen to 65%. And we communicated that companion animal has the highest margins in our total portfolio, followed by cattle, then swine and the lowest is poultry. So even if we have not provided details of each species, you can extrapolate that with the 65% that companion animal, being the highest, it's -- APOQUEL has a good margin. And in terms of how much we need to invest to support these product launches. So what we said is that we have the infrastructure to support the promotional activities of any new products. And maybe in some cases, we need also to support this approach probably some additional advertising and promotion. But in our opinion, in the case of APOQUEL, the reaction of the market has been so positive that we don't think that we'll require any significant additional investment to support the objective that we have set for 2015 and also the long-term objective of $200 million to $300 million peak sales. And then Paul will answer the question on the poison pill.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes. Yes, I'll answer the question by saying, with respect to your specific question around poison pill, no comment on that specifically. However, what I would say is, we're a public company. We're for sale every day and to the extend that someone were to come in and be interested and think they could do a better job with our collection of assets, there's certainly the opportunity for them to express that. What I would report back though is, we think we're the team to run this company. We're driving value for our shareholders. We're doing that by pulling all of the levers at our disposal which includes being maniacal about deploying capital both inside and, hopefully, outside of our business. And at the end of the day, if we deliver value, that's what we rely on to continue to be the fellows and ladies that run this company.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Erin Wilson of Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Livestock growth was impressive. Can you break out what was attributable to volume, price and new products, such as the beta agonists? How sustainable kind of is that growth? And also with consolidating competitors, there could also be some opportunities to potentially fill some holes in your portfolio. What are areas that you would find particularly interesting for you, any specific therapeutic category?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Well, we, in my opinion -- thank you, Erin, for the question. I think, in my opinion, we have a very strong portfolio. I believe that, that is the strongest portfolio in the animal health industry. We have always opportunities to fill some gaps, but we don't have a strategic need to really cover areas, which are important for animal health, which are not part of our portfolio. We are very strong in vaccines. We are very strong in parasiticide. We are strong in also other therapeutic areas and definitely we'll be always assessing opportunities to add more products to our portfolio. But because we think that we have the infrastructure and we have the opportunity to achieve synergies in both revenues and also in terms of costs, by adding products or adding assets of our company, but not because we have a strategic need to fill any area where we feel that we are -- or represent a significant gap in our business. And in terms of the livestock growth, definitely it has been very strong growth. Volume has been the most important part of the growth. And price, we also mentioned that the price is in line with the industry. The industry in terms of price is growing around 3% and this is consistent with our growth in terms of price. So all the rest has been volume, so very strong performance in terms of volume. That is also the result of excellent portfolio and also excellent execution from our teams to bring this as well to the market.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And as it relates to QUEL and the competing drug for Rimadyl, are there relationships with distributors that you could establish there and -- that would potentially help to win the competition there? And how big is opportunity for Versican? And is there an opportunity for that in the U.S.?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So we definitely partner with distributors that are also helping us to reach customers that we are not calling directly to our field force. And this partnership is working very well and I think it's something we are happy with the declaration that we are having with distributors. And we will continue really providing to them the products and also the kind of support that they need also to promote the products to customers that we are not directly targeting through our direct model.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Juan Ram\u00f3n for any additional or closing remarks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So thank you very much for joining today's call. And I'm looking forward to see you on November 18 in New York at the New York Stock Exchange, in where we'll have the opportunity to go into more details of our business model and also more details on our guidance for 2015 and also for the period of '15, '17.

Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 5, 2015. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "We have a significant amount of detail to cover today, including specific details of our financial outlook through 2017. We will be posting both Juan Ram\u00f3n and Paul's prepared remarks on the Investor section of zoetis.com following the call to help clearly disseminate these details.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly comment on our performance for the quarter. And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning. Paul will then walk you through our result for the quarter and discuss the financial impact of the operational efficiency program, including an update to guidance for 2015, '16 and '17.", "During the first quarter, we generated operational growth of 6% in revenue and 14% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 per share. During the quarter, half of our operational growth or 3% was attributed to price. New products, such as ACTOGAIN an acquired product from Abbott Animal Health, accounted for 2% while in-line products contributed to 1% of revenue growth for the quarter.", "As a note, all the following growth rates that I will discuss are operational. In livestock, we grew 7% to $715 million with all species contributing to growth. Cattle revenue grew 7% to $397 million with favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil driving growth across the portfolio, while weather and reduced herd size led to declines in Australia and New Zealand. Swine revenue, which grew 13% to $170 million, is benefiting from increased herd size in the U.S. after a winter of lower piglet mortality from PEDv plus positive industry momentum in the CLAR region. Poultry revenue grew 1% to $129 million as the U.S. reintroduction of Zoamix, a medicated feed additive, helped to offset a negative impact from the timing of product rotations in several countries.", "Turning to animal health -- companion animal health. Revenues grew 4% to $377 million due to the continued performance of key brands and overall strong growth in China and Latin American markets. We closed on the purchase of Abbott Animal Health assets in early February, so sales of newly acquired Abbott products also contributed to results. They were recorded primarily in the U.S. where we have seen additional competition in the pain and sedation markets.", "These results continue to demonstrate the strength of the business model as defined by our 3 interconnected capabilities: the largest and most capable field force in the industry with direct customer interactions, investing more innovation than any other company, and having the highest quality products and more reliable supply at a competitive cost. These 3 capabilities form an essential foundation for long-term success in animal health. Going forward, we are committed to investing in these capabilities but also see an opportunity to use them in more focused ways to enhance competitiveness and drive greater value for our customers and shareholders.", "Over the last 2 years, since becoming an independent company, we have delivered on our operating and financial targets, created shareholder value and continue to meet our customer needs while standing up a new global company and infrastructure. We are certainly proud of what we have achieved. And as we transition out of our stand-up phase, we are focused on driving efficiency and reducing complexity that is a barrier to productivity. The program we announced today is a comprehensive plan that is designed to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources. We enter this next stage building on solid business performance, and we'll emerge as a stronger, simpler and more cost-efficient organization.", "We expect to generate cost savings of $300 million in 2017 and see our adjusted EBIT margin improve from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve a greater focus on key brands and markets. We are fully aligned to achieve these goals and have the plans in place to incentivize our leaders to exceed these targets.", "These initiatives will allow us to derive additional value by taking full advantage of our scale. It will allow us to invest in the products, markets and infrastructure that will drive profitable growth and continued leadership in the animal health industry.", "There are several important reasons why we are initiating this program. First, after 2 years of separating from Pfizer, we now have full control of our operations, manufacturing and corporate systems and we have identified significant opportunities for improvement. Second, while the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint remain strength of our business, we have seen certain elements of our breadth generate complexity that is a barrier to delivering value to our customers and to generating long-term growth. Third, we are beginning to see the benefits of implementing our ERP system. The resulting standardization and potential to simplify our business through our new ERP system will allow us to increase productivity and streamline operations. And finally, we remain focused on growing revenues and finding the most productive ways to allocate resources to internal investments and business development activities.", "We have 3 main objectives for this operational efficiency initiative. First, we want to reduce complexity that does not add value for our customers and our business. Second, we want to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency. And third, we want to better position Zoetis for long-term profitable growth.", "We'll deliver our first objective to reduce complexity by enhancing our focus on products, markets and manufacturing plants that are most important to our future. We'll eliminate approximately 5,000 lower-revenue and lower-margin product SKUs out of a total of 13,000. This will drive higher focus and more reliable supply of our products and services.", "We'll enhance our manufacturing operations and accelerate the implementation of our supply network strategy. We plan to sell or exit about 10 manufacturing sites over the long term.", "Reflecting the strategic importance of manufacturing to our business model, Roman Trawicki, President of Global Manufacturing and Supply, will now report directly to me as part of the executive team. We will change our selling approach in approximately 30 markets by shifting to an indirect sales model or reducing our presence in certain countries.", "We reduce the number of regional reporting segments from 4 to 2: the U.S. and International. We expect these changes to result in greater decision-making authority closer to the customers while leveraging our scale to efficiently deliver marketing and other operational support. The U.S. Region will be led by Kristin Peck and the International Region will be led by Clint Lewis. Both are current members of our executive team and will continue reporting to me.", "To deliver on our second objective, to optimize resource allocation and efficiency, we will take the following actions: We will leverage the efficiency and standardization of our newly implemented ERP system to significantly reduce general and administrative costs in corporate functions. In addition to the ERP benefits, another important efficiency driver will be a reduction of management layers and increased span of control through the organization. We'll improve our ability to be more dynamic and agile in responding to customer needs by shifting marketing resources closer to the customer and simplifying all areas of noncustomer-facing commercial infrastructure. And we'll enhance our R&D focus to support a smaller portfolio of products as well as better prioritize the R&D portfolio to invest in projects with the highest returns.", "In the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to improve our operations and be more efficient. In 2009, we achieved a successful transformation when we became the world's largest animal health business through several acquisitions. Then in 2013, we became a large, global independent company followed by 2 consecutive years of industry-leading performance. Through each of these changes we have made ourselves better, improve how we serve customers and create new and greater value to our stakeholders. I'm confident that the comprehensive plan we have announced today will allow us to transform again, building on our successful business model to deliver high-quality profitable revenue growth and becoming a more competitive company.", "These are significant initiatives that will drive us to be a more focused and streamlined company. As a result, we'll see a reduction in the number of positions at Zoetis of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 over the next 12 to 18 months, subject to any consultation with work councils and unions in certain markets.", "With the implementation of this initiative, we will better align Zoetis' resources and operating structure with our 3 interconnected capabilities; supply products, more reliable and at a competitive cost; increase capacity to invest in future business drivers; and finally, tailor the product portfolio and improve efficiency of the operating model so we can pursue the next horizon of opportunity as a world leader with a single focus on animal health. Through this process, we'll be more competitive and better positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth.", "Before Paul cover the financial details, I would like to thank all our colleagues who have contributed to our success through an environment of intense change. Our next transformation will be key to supporting our future success, and I know that we have the capabilities and the team to implement these significant changes.", "Paul?", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning, everyone. We have lots of important things to talk about on this call, as we just revealed our plans to improve the efficiency of our operating model. But before we get to that, I don't want us to lose sight of the terrific quarter that we just put on the board. So let's get started.", "As you'll remember, our fourth quarter of 2014 featured strong operational growth and we were able to carry that momentum forward into Q1 of 2015 and give us a good start to the year. We delivered on our primary value drivers posting revenue and adjusted net income growth on an operational basis of 6% and 14%, respectively. Pretty good, right?", "Like other U.S. multinational companies, FX rates had a major impact on our reported results. On a reported basis, FX rates decreased our reported revenue by $58 million, resulting in our reported revenue growth being flat with Q1 of 2014. The impact on our adjusted net income was $16 million and so reduced our growth in adjusted net income from 14% on an operational basis to 8% on a reported basis. So FX impacted our top line by some 600 basis points and adjusted net income by 600 basis points.", "I said this before and I'll say it again today, we can't control FX rates. We manage our business on an operational basis, and on that basis, we're continuing to deliver strong fundamental growth in revenue and profits.", "You can read about the regional segment results in the press release and tables, so I won't spend too much time on them here, but I do want to cover a few highlights. The U.S. continued to perform very well, up 9% versus Q1 of '14, with strong livestock performance, which was up 14%. We continue to gain share in the U.S. livestock segment, especially cattle, based on producers' confidence in the reliability of our products to protect their investment in their animals. In companion animal, which was up 3%, we anticipate even more positive results through the balance of the year as we now have increased supply for APOQUEL. CLAR also continues performing well, with revenue up 13% on an operating basis, and that's driven by Brazil and other emerging markets. Later, when I talk about our go-forward plans to streamline and adjust our global footprint, I'll speak to our plans to deemphasize our efforts in Venezuela where the business and economic climates are becoming more challenging.", "In APAC, where we posted 1% operating growth in revenue, we're seeing good performance in emerging markets like China but drought conditions in developed markets, including Australia and New Zealand are having an impact. In EuAfME, where revenue was flat compared with Q1 of 2014, the takeaway is that good performance on our key brands in companion animal are being offset by declines in anti-infectives, primarily due to legislative changes in France.", "Now let me turn to what I will call our operational efficiency initiative. This initiative is a natural next step in the evolution of our company as a stand-alone entity with a singular focus on animal health. While we enjoy an enviable position in animal health today, our current product portfolio, footprint and organization came about in ways that were, to some extent, unplanned. The makeup of our product portfolio was heavily influenced by human health acquisitions made by Pfizer that had animal health components. These were very important to building our scale and portfolio, but the animal health assets were not the focus of those deals. And while we spend a lot of time and energy standing up our own organization and building our own culture, we quite naturally carried across organizational designs, processes and practices that worked well when we were a division of Pfizer, but may not represent the best options for a pure-play animal health company. Said another way, it's doubtful that we serendipitously came upon the best possible structure and organization to maximize our opportunity in the animal health industry.", "Our first priority over the last few years has been to build out the functions that we need to support our business on a stand-alone basis. We had to establish our own supply chain, build our own IT infrastructure and put in place the G&A functions like finance, HR and legal to support a global public company. While we did that, we elected to leave our commercial and R&D organizations largely as is to minimize the impact of our stand-up on our customers and on our business.", "I think our track record of revenue and profit growth over the last 2 years, and so far into 2015, support the wisdom of that approach. But now with the completion of the stand-up activities in sight, it's time to look at the entirety of our current state and take steps to improve the design and efficiency of our company.", "Importantly, we are not questioning the fundamental elements of our business model. Our model relies on what we refer to as our 3 interconnected capabilities: one, face-to-face interaction with our customers to drive revenue; two, investment in product innovation to sustain our revenue base and our growth prospects; and three, the ability to meet our customers' demand with quality products. These capabilities form the basis of our competitive advantage in the global animal health industry and changes to these areas will fall into the category of continuous improvement, not major changes.", "The bulk of our future cost savings will not impact these areas. Our field force, the personnel in the front lines with our customers, will remain largely intact. The scope of our activities in R&D will also remain substantially the same, and we will continue to invest in programs to build and improve our supply chain.", "Let me separate the 2015 program into 2 parts as I see them and then add on the previously announced supply network strategy to think about 3 areas of focus. Part 1 is what I'll call rationalizing our footprint, part 2 is driving improved efficiency in our operating expenses, and part 3 is streamlining and improving the efficiency of our supply chain.", "Starting with rationalizing our footprint. This work included a review of the number of SKUs that make up our product portfolio, consideration of moving to indirect sales models in a number of markets where we currently have a direct presence and evaluations of markets where we might choose to reduce our efforts. The headline here is that we will be eliminating nearly 40% of our total SKUs. These SKUs create significant complexity across multiple functions within our company. Of course, this will reduce our revenue and gross profits in the near term, but it will enable us to substantially improve the efficiency of our operations, from our supply chain and sales support, to G&A expenses and the product maintenance costs that are part of our R&D. With a leaner portfolio comprised of our more profitable product assets, we will have better growth prospects.", "We also intend to move from direct sales models to indirect distributor models in certain countries and reduce our efforts or exit some markets. When complete, the streamlining of our portfolio and global footprint will reduce our expected 2017 sales by some $280 million and gross profit by about $100 million. For the avoidance of doubt, those numbers are based on current FX rates. The estimated revenue and gross profit impacts are reflected in our revised guidance for 2016 and 2017.", "Part 2 of the initiative is driving improved efficiency within our SG&A expenses and our investment in R&D. We're collapsing from 4 regions to 2 as we go forward. We're reorganizing the support for countries, including enabling functions, like finance, IT, HR and legal, but also the noncustomer-facing resources that support our field sales forces. We're taking steps to improve the focus of our R&D activities, supporting a smaller portfolio of products, identifying greater efficiency in our regulatory practices and better prioritizing our R&D spend. And yes, our expected spend for customer-facing resources will be less as well, mainly driven by the reduction in the number of markets where we'll have a direct presence, and the deemphasis of certain other markets but also through improvements in efficiency.", "In total, by calendar 2017, we expect our total operating expenses, that is the sum of SG&A plus R&D, to be roughly $300 million less than it would have been but for this initiative.", "As I said just a moment ago, we are not changing our business model here and that should be reflected in the way you should think about the sources of the $300 million of future savings. Roughly 1/3 is expected to come from reduced G&A and another 1/3 from commercial resources that are not customer-facing. That's roughly 2/3 of the expected savings coming from areas that should not impact our ability to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth.", "Of the remaining cost savings, about 10% is expected to come from improvements in efficiency within our R&D organization. About 5% is expected to come from the reduction of our field resources tied to our revised global footprint and reduced emphasis in some emerging markets, and the balance of the cost savings here is expected to come from reducing complexity and increasing efficiency in other areas.", "The third and final piece of the initiative is the supply network strategy that Kristin Peck outlined at our Investor Day last November. Most of the benefits of that work will be realized after 2017. So for now let's set the supply network strategy aside and focus on the activities that will impact our results in the period from 2015 to 2017, but keep in mind that the supply network strategy initiative is expected to add some 200 basis points to our gross margin by 2020 on top of the improvements driven by the 2015 initiative.", "You've heard me say this many times in the past that when we're looking at our operating efficiency, there are opportunities for us to do better. Today we back those words up, providing you with a framework of our plans to improve the operating performance of Zoetis while preserving the key elements of our value proposition. In our to be state in calendar 2017, we'll be an even better company than we are today, more profitable on a slightly smaller revenue base, positioned to deliver better growth from a more focused product portfolio and working off of a leaner cost structure that can be leveraged to support revenue and profit growth over the long term.", "After completing the change we're announcing today, we'll still be the leader in animal health, and we will continue to be the biggest investor in innovation in animal health. And we will continue to have the largest direct sales network in the industry. Our improved efficiency will provide us with more flexibility to allocate resources where we can best serve our customers' needs and to further distance ourselves from the competition.", "The efficiency initiative adds an estimated $200 million to our expectations for pretax earnings in 2017, driven by the $300 million in operating expense savings, offset in part by the $100 million of projected decrease in gross profit attributable to the streamlining of our product portfolio and the rationalizing of our global footprint. This initiative adds roughly $0.28 to our prior estimate of 2017 adjusted net income per share.", "So the song remains the same, only better. We're a company that can grow its re-based revenues in line with or faster than the mid-single-digit growth of our markets while holding the growth in our leaned-out operating expenses to the inflation rate and thereby delivering long-term profit growth greater than our revenue growth. And that's off of a higher profit base, and that's a winner.", "Of course, the improvements in our future financial model don't come free. So I want to take a few minutes to talk about one-time costs generally and to specifically address the costs associated with the efficiency initiative. First, it's important for you to know that we have a high standard when it comes to costs that we characterize as onetime and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted net income. Our policy limits such adjustments to purchase accounting, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items that we evaluate on an individual basis. These include direct and incremental costs required to complete the stand-up of the company and those direct costs that we will incur to execute our efficiency plan.", "Next, we want to be transparent about the amount and nature of these costs, so our intention is to provide disclosure of our onetime costs in 3 buckets. The bucket for stand-up costs and other onetime costs that you're already familiar with; a new bucket for the efficiency initiative that we announced today; and a third bucket for the cost associated with the longer-term elements of the supply network strategy. We estimate our remaining pretax stand-up and other onetime costs at $180 million to $210 million with those costs to be recorded primarily in the remainder of 2015 and through 2017. These are primarily all-cash costs.", "We estimate the onetime pretax cash costs associated with the efficiency initiative to be in the range of $340 million to $400 million and to be incurred in 2015, 2016 and with some modest portion moving into 2017. We expect actual cash payouts to occur over the next few years. Note that there will also be noncash charges triggered by this initiative. We are not providing an estimate of these charges as both the amounts and timing could vary widely. As we incur these noncash charges, we'll call them out for you when recognized.", "Finally, the supply-network strategy. onetime-pretax cash costs are currently estimated at $60 million to $100 million and are expected to be incurred over the term of the plan. It's worth noting that we are still in the early phases of architecting the supply network strategy, and the final onetime costs for this activity could be substantially different depending on the final outcome of our ongoing analysis of our supply network and the timing or nature of any specific site exits. There will also be noncash charges triggered by the supply network strategy, and we will call those out to you when recognized.", "Note that the estimates of onetime pretax costs for both the efficiency initiative and the supply network strategy ignore the possible proceeds that we may receive from the sale of certain assets, which could potentially offset some of the onetime cash costs. We provided a webcast slide that summarizes our current estimates of the onetime pretax cash costs associated with each of the 3 buckets over the period from 2015 to 2017. We will refresh our view of the various buckets of onetime costs as appropriate.", "I want to call your attention now to an unrelated change to our go-forward outlook, and that's our decision to decrease our activities in Venezuela. The animal health industry in Venezuela features solid underlying fundamentals and our business there has performed well. However, recent economic developments necessitate an evaluation of our efforts there. While our business in Venezuela is profitable, it has become increasingly difficult to realize those profits in U.S. dollars. Unless and until that environment changes, sales and profits there will drive low quality earnings, so we're significantly paring back our activities there.", "To be clear, Venezuela is a solid local market and we will maintain a presence there as we believe that the environment will improve over time. However, in the interim, we believe it's prudent to reduce our activities and exposure there.", "The decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela impacts our revenue and profit expectations for 2015, '16 and '17. The impact on 2015 can be seen in the exhibit to our press release that bridges from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. We've also provided a slide on the webcast that shows the impact of Venezuela on 2017, which decreases our expectations for adjusted net income in 2017 by $0.07 per share.", "Now let me provide an update on our guidance for the full year 2015 in light of the changes in FX rates since our last guidance update, the anticipated impacts of the efficiency program and our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. I also want to update you on our expectation for 2016 and '17 and to provide you with more detail about those years. We felt it was important to say more about 2016 and '17 as there are a lot of moving parts here, and we want you to have a clear picture of our expectations.", "First, 2015 full year guidance. In our press release and in a webcast slide, we provided a bridge from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. The headline is that despite the continued headwinds from changes in FX rates and our decision to reduce our business in Venezuela, we're holding our guidance for adjusted net income per share for 2015 in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. This includes pluses and minuses. FX is a minus again. The changes in FX rates from late January, underlying our last updated guidance, to late April, decreased our revenue expectation for 2015 by some $75 million or 155 basis points, while the impact on adjusted net income was much less, only about $5 million or 60 basis points. Then our decision to pare back our efforts in Venezuela reduces our revenue expectations by $50 million, operating expenses by $5 million and decreased our expectations for adjusted net income by $25 million.", "Finally, the big plus, and that's the impact of the efficiency initiative, which reduced our expectations for operating expenses by $45 million compared with our prior guidance and increased our expected adjusted net income by $30 million. So when the dust settles, we expect our reported revenue to be down by $125 million from our prior guidance range and our adjusted net income to be consistent with our prior guidance, $1.61 to $1.68 per share.", "It's worth pointing out that we decreased our 2015 guidance for revenue growth on an operational basis by 100 basis points to the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The reduction in the growth rate is due to the expected reduction in sales in Venezuela. We translate Venezuela revenues at the fixed official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 to the dollar, so the $50 million expected reduction in revenue shifts the operational growth rate. And the adjusted net income operational growth rate is estimated to increase 1% as a contribution from our efficiency program should more than offset the impact of Venezuela.", "Turning to 2016 and '17. We provided a lot of detail for you so that you can recalibrate your expectations for us through 2017. As you can see how this longer-term guidance compares with your prior expectations, I submit that you must first revise your prior expectations to reflect the changed FX rates. To help you do that, the change in FX rates from late January to late April should reduce your 2016 and 2017 revenue expectations by roughly 215 -- excuse me, 215, 2-1-5 basis points, cost of goods sold by 260, 2-6-0 basis points and operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D by 170 basis points, with the result being a roughly 235 basis point decrease in projected adjusted net income driven by the changes in FX rates. Using that re-based forecast in comparison with our revised guidance for 2016 and '17 will enable you to isolate and evaluate the impacts of the 2015 efficiency initiative together with our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. In a nutshell, and looking at 2017, when the full benefits of our efficiency initiative are expected to be realized, the efficiency initiative increases our expectations for 2017 pretax income by roughly $200 million. Meanwhile, the Venezuela action reduces our pretax expectations by $55 million. Net, we add $145 million to our pretax expectations for 2017, roughly $100 million in adjusted net income or $0.20 per share. As Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned, the steps we are taking over the next several years are expected to enable us to improve our EBIT margin by some 500 basis points in 2017 to circa 34%.", "Here are a few other factors for you to consider. Our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. We expect a slightly higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year 2015, higher than the 27% that we had in the first quarter of 2015. The operating expense benefits that we are seeking will begin to be most evident in Q4, and our guidance assumes a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. This includes share repurchases totaling an estimated $100 million in the first half of 2015, which are partially offset by actual and projected dilution relating to employees' equity-based compensation. We also assumed a comparable level of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2016 and '17 as we intend for our share repurchase program to at least offset projected dilution from future employee compensation programs, including the acceleration impacts of our operational efficiency initiative. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release.", "Finally, we covered a lot of ground on this call. To assist with clear communications, as John said, we will be posting copies of Juan Ram\u00f3n's and my scripts to our Investor Relations website following this call. That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open up the line for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.", "Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So my question is on your organic sales growth and also your gross margin once you lap on the headwinds from, I guess, getting rid of some of these lower-margin SKUs.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Louise. And definitely, our plan is to have our growth in terms of revenues in line or faster than the market. The market is expected to grow about 5% in the medium- and long-term, and we are also targeting it to grow in line with this growth or exceed this growth. In terms of gross margin, we also plan to significantly increase our gross margin. So eliminating these lower-margin SKUs will represent 200 basis points of gross margin improvement and also the price increases and also the discipline on -- or the reduction of expenses also will generate a significant improvement in gross margin. So on top of that, as Paul mentioned, our plan and work strategy that we announced at the time of the Investor Day will also generate another 200 basis points of gross margin improvement.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes, Louise, and it's Paul, I'll just follow on that. I'll just point you to the slide on the webcast for the 2015 to '17 guidance, and you can see the impact -- or the expected improvement in our gross margin there, where we're looking out to 2017 after the, as I say, after the dust settles. So we'll get to a margin where we're projecting a range of 32% to 33% and with the opportunity to do better than that as we continue our progress on our supply network strategy.", "Operator", "And we can take that question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So looking at the operational improvement initiative. Paul, you laid out a lot of good information. I guess kind of a combination question. In 2016, operational growth looks a little bit like the negative 1% to plus 2%. Is that really due to getting out of Venezuela? Because it looks like you guys expect some pretty decent growth from that market. And I guess strategically, have you embedded much in terms of M&A acquisitions? I guess, where do your interests really lie within diagnostics? It looked like a new product launch in diagnostics may have helped drive some of the companion animal growth we saw in U.S. Just wondering if that's the feline rapid test and wondering if you have other plans in that category.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. It's Paul. I'll start with talking about the growth rate in 2016. I mean, one of the reasons why we felt compelled to provide a lot of detail around '16 and '17 is, as we go about the, what I'll call, the rationalization of our portfolio, the timing of when those sales go away will certainly have an impact on what you should expect, as what we expect, for 2016. And then we return to what I'll call a rebased model in 2017. So 2 things affecting '16: one, as you correctly point out, is Venezuela hitting the operational rate; and the second is, the timing of the SKUs that we're pruning from the portfolio when we start to see a decrease in sales. You note that we, for the balance of '15, expect -- did not show you a line item reducing our revenue expectations associated with the reduction in the SKUs in the portfolio. That really starts to come into play in 2016 and we should enter '17 clean.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So let me answer the question on M&A. So definitely, M&A is part of our strategy, and we are considering any M&A opportunity that will increase the value of this company and will support our objective in terms of generating higher margins in our operations. So where is our interest? Any opportunity which is in the animal health domain. We think that we have all the capabilities, and also now we have, or will have, even much better ratios in terms of cost and in terms of expenses to revenue, so we can really maximize opportunities of any potential acquisition.", "Operator", "And we can take that question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.", "Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just wonder if you'd -- try and elaborate a little bit more on the operational efficiency initiative here. I guess in the past, you've talked a lot about your direct selling model being a competitive advantage versus some of your peers. Can you just elaborate a little bit more with the decision today in the smaller markets to move to more of an indirect model? Just what's changed in terms of that view? Is it that these were markets that were never going to get the scale you needed to justify the investments you're making? I'm trying to understand a little bit more the strategic shift that you're making on those. Second question is just with the new kind of plan as you're aligning your approach here. Are there any management incentives that you're putting in place or any changes to management incentive that are going to come about as a result of this operational efficiency plan as we think about the 2015 targets, et cetera?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Chris. And what we are trying with this initiative is to be much more focused. And we mentioned many times that our diversity, or the breadth of our business, it was a competitive advantage. But we have also identified some areas or some elements of this diversity, which is adding a complexity, which is a barrier to deliver value to our customers and also to create that value to Zoetis. What we are trying is we've now been much more focused on the countries and also the products that will generate the highest value to Zoetis. It's to really move away from our model, which is a model that will be 100% applicable to those markets, and we are now in these small markets in -- where we don't see that the model is efficient in terms of our profitability, and then moving to a model that will be indirect and will be relying more on distributors to support our revenues. So the strategy is not changing. What we are, it's really focused on the market that would generate the highest opportunities for Zoetis and also the product that will integrate the highest revenues to our company and the most profitable growth. In terms of the management incentives, we have in place programs to incentivize our leaders in Zoetis for exceeding the $300 million target that we have in our program. So we have these plans and we are convinced that we'll be working to meet or exceed our objectives.", "Operator", "We'll take that question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America.", "Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Does the new guidance on the top line include contributions in Sarolaner, and could that still provide upside? And do you have cash flow forecast for us? And I think you gave some color here, but does your guidance include share repurchases and plans for deleveraging?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So let me answer the first question, and then Paul will answer the second one. Thank you, Erin, for both your questions. So the new products, Sarolaner, IL-31, are not part of our guidance today. So we are in process of discussing with the FDA and USDA and other regulators. So once we have more understanding of the timing of these product launches, we'll incorporate in our guidance.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "And it's Paul, I'll speak to the cash flow guidance. We're not providing -- we provided an awful lot of detail on the operating side here through 2017. We're not, at this time, providing a forecast of cash flow and our balance sheet, but suffice it to say that we talked in the past about our desire to improve our asset efficiency. For example, through the implementation of our global ERP system, SAP, we expect that over time, we'll be able to reduce our investment in our inventory and unlock some cash there. Frankly, by paring down our business and pruning our portfolio, with the SKUs, that will unlock some cash -- cash as well. We do have an awful lot of calls on our cash here coming up in the very near term. I mean, if you think about it in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. We do continue to use cash to fund the onetime costs associated with our separation from Pfizer, and we've provided an estimate of the remaining amount of that to be somewhere in the range of $180 million to $210 million. We provided you with an estimate of the cost of the efficiency initiative that we announced today and the early stages of our supply network strategy, and those costs are estimated in the range of $300 million or $400 million to $500 million over the next several years. And we have, I'll call it out for you, the $400 million debt maturity coming up next spring. And then we have our regular dividend coming up. So we do have some sizable calls on our cash. We have actually provided you also with some guidance, a little bit of guidance at this stage around our share repurchases. We indicated that we expect to purchase, in aggregate, $100 million worth of shares over the first half of 2015 and that we can -- expect to continue acquiring shares in the amount that will at least offset the ongoing dilution from our equity-based compensation plans. And I said in the past, I'll say it again, the share repurchase will be an ongoing part of our plans for our capital allocation. I think of it -- share purchase activity that underlies our 2017 guidance as a baseline for that activity. As we generate either free cash or debt capacity, we'll adjust our plans there as appropriate. Did I cover it all? Sorry, the deleveraging question as well. Yes, we have stated in the past that we have kind of a notional -- when we talk about our capital structure, a notional floor of gross debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA of 2.5x. So I want to reiterate there's a permanent role for debt in our capital structure, and when you think about that cap structure, we remain committed to be responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital. And our hierarchy for that capital allocation will be first and foremost inside our business; second for business development activity that is value-generative; and lastly, transactions and shareholders including both the regular dividend and the ongoing share repurchases. So again, think of that 2.5x as a floor and think of our hierarchy of capital allocation as I outlined it for you. I hope I answered the question.", "Operator", "And we can take our next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research", "We appreciate all the details on the efficiency program. EuAfME sales were below expectations. Could you comment on the impact of the new anti-infective legislation in France and whether you think that's going to spread to other developed markets. And Paul, I'm not sure if you addressed this, but how much of your lower OpEx this quarter was driven by FX as opposed to other savings? And then, finally, could you comment on the launch of APOQUEL and whether your prior guidance still stands.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Alex. So the situation in Europe/Africa/Middle East, revenues were affected by the France performance. So they announced the new legislation related to anti-infective legislation. It's eliminating rebates offered by animal health manufacturers to both wholesalers and veterinarians. And as a result of this elimination of rebates, there was an adjustment in the market in terms of inventory levels. We expect that this will be, in the next quarter, compensated and back to normal situation. And now Paul will answer the comment also in terms of the impact of FX.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Yes, Alex, and there's really 2 ways you and think about this. First is you can see the impact, the impact on the first quarter alone, on SG&A expenses in the quarter was roughly 5% change was due to FX, and in R&D, it was 2%. I think a more helpful way to think about it might be to look at our guidance bridge slide going from our previous guidance in February to our updated guidance today. And you can see the expected impact on the full year relative to that February guidance is roughly $20 million on SG&A expenses and none on R&D.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "And then the comment on the APOQUEL. So in the first quarter of this year, the revenues of APOQUEL have been still facing limited supply. But from April, we have been able to meet the demands of our customers in U.S., also U.K. and Germany, and we expect that the product will meet our expectations in 2015 of delivering $150 million to $175 million in 2015. And we also are planning now in launching APOQUEL in additional markets that will be also making contribution to meet these expectations for the product.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "We have some problem there with the line?", "Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "So the question is about incremental form of [indiscernible]. So the question about M&A and the Tax Matters Agreement with Pfizer that I believe expires next month. So your new cost reduction plan and Tax Matters Agreement expiration, whether this will change your overall strategy for future acquisitions, M&A, and whether you're still open for targets of various size or -- and think about the ZTS as -- more as a net acquirer, not acquisition target. As well as if you're still open for potentially inversion transaction as an avenue to reduce effective tax rate.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "So let me mention on the tax agreement that you're right, this tax agreement will end on June 24. We mentioned on previous calls that this is something that will eliminate any restrictions, but we didn't think that it was a significant restriction for any type of transaction related to acquisition or licensing or any other divestment. In terms of the new program, its changing our strategy, we think that our strategy has been always to consider M&A opportunities that will create value to Zoetis and will create more value to our shareholders. Definitely, the new program will generate more cash, and more cash also will help us to consider any kind of opportunity. In terms of inversion, I think again, so we are open to any opportunity that will increase the value to our shareholders and is something that we'll be always open. But we know there are not too many options that we can consider in terms of inversion or acquisition of our company that will facilitate this kind of tax strategy.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "I'll just follow on, in that I think that with our leaned-out structure, we will be better positioned to realize value from acquisitions that we might consider. I mean as -- looking backwards, using as a great example, the Abbott Animal Health assets. When you have a better cost structure and you can absorb those and realize the synergies, you can gain better value over assets that you're able to acquire. As Juan Ram\u00f3n said, I want to buttress that as well. We're always thinking about ways that we can build value here, and one of those ways is through smart business development activity.", "Operator", "We can take that question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.", "Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow up on an earlier question, about trying to trim assets [ph]. Clearly what you're doing makes a kind of sense, simplifying a very complex cost structure, it's -- reasons why companies spin off assets and those assets tend to perform much better as separate companies. But I'm actually kind of surprised, Juan, when you said your expectation is that revenue growth -- you sort of reiterated the type of organic growth that you have been anticipating, which is the market growth of 5% to 7%. I would think, with shrinking the revenue base and getting out of slower growth or less profitable businesses, that would give you an opportunity to accelerate top line growth, and wondering if you can just talk about that.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Jami, and I think you are right in your comment. We are doing that because we think that being much more focused will be an opportunity to accelerate growth in products, markets that will be important to our future profitable growth, and this is something that definitely we will be working to ensure that the programs that will stay in our portfolio will generate maximum opportunities. The other important thing is that we also want to make sure that we increase our supply to our customers on those problems that really matter to them. And we want to have a reliable supply and to eliminate the risk for product supply issues that's always very, very different [ph] to our customers. So with being much more focused we are convinced that we can generate a higher profitable growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.", "John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "You talked about a changing approach to R&D. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? And one specific one. Do you still expect Sarolaner to reach the market by spring of '16? But then more broadly, what are the source of products that you're refocusing the R&D efforts on? Is there any criteria around, let's say, region or animal species?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you for the question, John. And in terms of R&D, so we are eliminating 5,000 SKUs. So if we are eliminating about 40% of our total SKUs, you can also assume that we'll be eliminating some of the programs that are a very important part of our investment. And just to remind you, almost 50% or even more of our R&D investment is related to life cycle management. So if we are eliminating 40% of our SKUs, we should be also eliminating programs in life cycle management that are supporting this part of the portfolio. We also think that it's a good opportunity also for us to identify the future problems that will generate the highest potential in the animal health industry. We have been extremely successful in identifying these opportunities, and APOQUEL is a good example, but also our progress on bringing back vaccines to the market like PEDv vaccine and many other vaccines that we have been introducing is a good example of being focused, identifying these opportunities. It's a great opportunity for us like this. We'll remain doing that and we are not changing our approach in R&D, but we are trying to identify those projects that would generate the highest return to our company. In terms of Sarolaner, we are working with the FDA. We are presenting all the information that FDA is requesting, and we expect that the program will be launched in 2016.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "Before we ask the next question, it's Paul, and I just want to jump in. R&D is, as I said in my prepared remarks and Juan Ram\u00f3n referenced as well, that's 1 of our 3 key interconnected capabilities and one where we're not changing substantially here. What we're looking for is ways that we can improve the process by which we select projects to go into the queue and then come out on the other end. And John, the way you phrased your question was almost exactly the way I've talked about this inside, is the alignment of our portfolio around our key brands and around our key regional strategies for growth, and ensuring that this course alignment of our R&D strategy around those key brands and regional strategies. And as I say all the time, any process -- and we've been very productive in R&D. Any process that we have can be improved and that's what we're doing here, call it, continuous improvement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company.", "Kathleen M. Miner - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just to follow up a little more on the 5,000 SKUs that will be eliminated. Can you give us a little more color on them? Such as how many products this might include and will we see a change in your therapeutic product mix post the elimination of these products? And second, just a quick question on the antibody for atopic dermatitis that you expect conditional approval for, is that still on track for the end of this year?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, Kathy, and definitely, these 5,000 SKUs are not 5,000 products. The number of products is much lower. I don't think we have provided the number of programs that will be affected. It's something that definitely, we plan to provide this information to our customers in the next coming weeks, and we also plan to send a communication to our customers on those programs that will be affecting every market. In terms of the change of the mix, well, the mix will improve in terms of profitability, so these products, as we mentioned, are low margin. So by eliminating these low-margin products, we'll improve our margin and mix and this will have a positive impact in our operations. IL-31 is still on track for conditional approval in 2015. We are working with the USDA and we expect this conditional license approval anytime at the end of the year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.", "Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the sales force. If I understood correctly, the reduction in the sales force that you proposed is only from the sales force that's associated with products or regions that you're exiting, and you don't anticipate any curtails in sales force in the regions that will remain ongoing. Is that correct? I just want to make sure that I understood that correctly.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you for the question, Liav.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "I'll take it.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "No the reduction on the field force, it's mainly related to those markets that we are planning to change our model, moving from direct to indirect. Also, in some of the markets, so we are also adjusting our field force to the real potential of our portfolio. We are not changing our field force in key markets like the U.S. We have some small adjustments in some markets in Europe, which is also the reflect of the market potential of those markets. But basically, we are maintaining our presence in the market. So we are convinced that our direct interaction with the customer represent a significant competitive advantage and we are planning to protect these interactions and continue interacting there with customers on a daily basis. And again, I want to insist that in most of the markets, there is no any change in the infrastructure of our field force. What is something that is applicable not only to the field force but to the rest of the organization: we are also considering being much more efficient in terms of span of control. And this will imply some elimination of layers, also in the field force, but not in the people that have customer-facing interactions.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.", "David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask about the 2 segments of the company, companion and livestock. Could you just characterize the different margins for the 2 business segments? I don't know how much detail you can provide, but I was hoping that you could help to provide a baseline for us in terms of where the operating margins stand for each of the segments? And then looking ahead, which of the 2 is the 1 that will experience greater margin expansion over the next 3 years.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Thank you, David. So let me start by mentioning maybe the difference between companion animal and livestock in terms of gross profit. So in terms of gross profit, companion animal, it's generating the highest margins, and you know that we have a margin of -- a gross profit of 65%. The net companion animal is much higher than this 65%. And then livestock, we have a different margin depending on cattle, swine or poultry. Being in poultry, the lowest in terms of our gross profit and, cattle, the highest in terms of our gross profit in livestock. But then you also need to add what is the cost to win these products to the customers. And then in that case, I think the total margins are much more equalized. So companion animal require a significant much more field force and promotional activities because the number of our customers in companion animal it's much higher than in livestock. And then poultry is the most consolidated industry, so it require fewer individuals to reach the customers, while cattle still require a significant number of people to reach these customers. So even gross profit are different across different species. In terms of the total margin, the margins are much more similar. And we think that there are opportunities in both. We have been growing livestock faster than companion animal in the recent years. Now with APOQUEL, with Sarolaner, with Abbott, with IL-31, we expect that companion animal will generate a significant growth in our operations.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we can take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Just a quick follow-up here. I guess going back to the SKUs that are going to be eliminated. Paul, did I miss -- did you provide how much revenue those products are going to generate or what the impact would be from the SKU elimination in 2016? And then also in the press release, you talked about the feed additive for the poultry, Zoamix. Just wondering how big that could get. And I guess what's your thought, Juan Ram\u00f3n, on the scrutiny and some of the restaurant companies eliminating using antibiotics in the chickens, especially -- oh, and also, thoughts on the avian flu.", "Paul S. Herendeen", "I'll start. Yes, the first question with respect to the period SKUs. We did not provide a specific amount or impact on our 2016 just to say that, by definition, we included the impact as we provided the detailed guidance for 2016. And then call your attention to 2017 where we call it out and it's really $280 million of top line that we expect, relative to our prior expectations, for 2017. And the way I would think of it is 100 is a curious thing with this $10 million of OpEx that maps the cost of goods sold. So the table, you'll see the $290 million versus $300 million, but with $300 million OpEx, you think like $280 million and $100 million, that's the impact on '17 when it's fully reflected in our re-based revenues and that's how I think about it.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "And on the majority of this key SKU elimination will take place in 2016. So we should expect that there will be an impact in terms of revenues in 2016 that would be very close to this $280 million that Paul just mentioned. So we have not mentioned the exact revenues of Zoamix in the U.S. But what we mentioned is that this has been compensating the rotation of products that are in the industry. It's using it as a way to protect the animal health in the poultry industry. In terms of -- you also asked about the comments on poultry and antibiotics of a recent company that has been issuing a press release in the U.S. Definitely, we are fully aligned with the FDA objective to reduce the impact of -- or the resistance of antibiotics in animal health. These 2 companies have announced that they will eliminate the use of human health products in poultry. In some cases, like Tyson, we have been already working with Tyson some years ago to eliminate these products. And because we have, in our portfolio, alternative to the products which are important for human health, we think that we'll be able to supply to companies in the poultry in the U.S. that will be eliminating gradually the use of human health products, which are important or antibiotic which are important for human health. With all the alternatives that we have in our portfolio, that we also keep the poultry industry productive and also protecting animals against infections.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.", "Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just was trying to just dig a little bit more into the motivating factor that's leading you to this broad restructuring. I guess my question, are you seeing the market changing? Or is this really that you've gotten out of Pfizer, you've had the chance to review the broader strategy, that you're just having time now to dig into these business units and really try to focus the organization overall? I'm just trying to understand, higher level, what led you down this path to begin with?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Okay, this program has been part of our plans since the beginning. So it means we have separated from Pfizer. We had, in our thinking, that we should generate greater efficiencies and also define cost-saving opportunities. We also knew that in the first 2 years as a public company, we needed to focus on standing up our infrastructure. Also making sure that we are meeting our objectives in terms of revenue growth, also our objectives in terms of profit growth. We also needed to have full control of our operations. And when I mean full control of our operations, have a full understanding of our corporate functions, also full understanding of manufacturing and, also very important, control of our IT systems. We also decided early in the process of separating from Pfizer to invest in the new ERP. And now that the ERP has been already implemented in certain markets in Europe and went live in the U.S. at the end of April, we see that we are in the process to finalize all these implementations in the first quarter of 2016. With all these elements, I think we are in the position to identify these opportunities to be more efficient, and not only opportunities to be more efficient, but the opportunity to be much more focused. And I want to seize the complexity that we have in some of our operations. It's a barrier to deliver value to our customers. And this is one of the objectives that we have as part of this program, to ensure that we deliver higher value to our customers by being much more focused on certain problems in certain markets.", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'll turn the floor back over to Juan Ram\u00f3n for any additional or closing remarks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix", "Well, thank you very much for joining us for today's call. We had the opportunity to share with you a lot of information, and we'll be pleased to have a follow-up conversation with you if you need some additional understanding of all the plans that we are announcing and also all the products that we are making as an independent company.

Today, I will discuss our performance for the second quarter and provide updates related to the integration of Abbott Animal Health, the performance of new products and progress on our operational efficiency program.", "Paul will then will provide additional perspective on the quarter and comment on our guidance for 2015, 2016, 2017. All the growth rate that I'm discussing today are rational, excluding the impact of foreign currency. I am very pleased to report that this quarter, we generated very strong revenue and adjusted net income and growth based on the strength and the diversity of our business.", "The growth this quarter was driven by the positive performance of our portfolio, in both companion animal and livestock. The addition of Abbott Animal Health and the growth of APOQUEL and other new products and the continued discipline on operating expenses. In the quarter, we generated operational growth of 11% of revenue and 20% in adjusted net income or adjusted diluted EPS of $0.42 per share. This performance continued to demonstrate our long-term valuable position and grow adjusted earnings faster than sales.", "In the quarter, APOQUEL contributed 2% of revenue growth or $19 million. Abbott Animal Health accounted for 2% of the revenue growth or $25 million and another 2% came from new product launches. The remaining at 5% is related to both performance including a 2% price increase.", "In livestock, we view 8% even by some growth in cattle and swine. Cattle then grew 9% with continued favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil, partially offset by the impact of the full reductions in poultry. Swine products also made a contribution this quarter, growing 14% based on strong sales in the U.S. and China.", "In the U.S., the markets for swine continued for building after the original impact of PEDv. We continue adoption of our key brands and a positive impact in terms like our better ACTOGAIN. Quarter revenue grew 1% reflecting new product launches which were partially offset by the customer rotation of medicated feed additives in certain Latin American markets.", "Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 15% due to additional sales from the Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands such as APOQUEL in the [indiscernible] space and some whole and production insights. We feel very good about the progress we have made on the duration of Abbott Animal Health and we expect to achieve the target we've set from the condition in terms of revenue and cost percentages.", "Now switching to Sarolaner operational updates, we completed the go live profile of our ERP system in the U.S. at the beginning of May as scheduled. From a systems and control point of view, the completion was successful.", "However, due to a large number of our customers electrically impacted by our change of systems, we've had customers experiencing a disruption in their services. The variability of these shipments and these issues have been resolved. And customers should see the level of our service improving and turning to the quality they expect and deserve from us.", "Foreign presentation in other countries will remain on track to complete the growing ERP product by the end of Q1 2016. As for the Abbott growth, since the beginning of the year, we've had significant increase product supply and today more than 13,000 veterinarians have access to APOQUEL in the U.S. and more in markets outside of the U.S.. We have the manufacturing capacity to meet the future demands of the public but the process of scaling up the active pharmaceutical ingredient or API, as we mentioned to you.", "We have now made the necessary changes to improve the process and we're continuing to ramp up the manufacturing . While the situation is improving, we're not yet meeting all our market demand and our first priority is to manage a solution of available supply to our locations and to fulfill August for our current customers.", "With that in mind, we have temporarily suspended taking new first-time customers' orders for APOQUEL in most markets. We remain committed to making APOQUEL available to new customers as soon as possible. Even with these change in our operating products, we now expect revenue for APOQUEL to be about $150 million in 2015 and increasing really early in 2016. The productivity of our investment in new product notion and following the product development continue to support our future growth at.", "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has granted a conditional license for a first trial of first-of-its-kind antibody therapy that targets interleukin-31 or IL-31, to help reduce clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis in dogs. It represents another major breakthrough from our R&D platform based on new scientific insights into the pathway of allergic skin conditions. We continue to receive approvals for new indications and formulations of our key products and we have expanded many products into new markets. In the second quarter, for example, we seeked approval of a new label claims in the U.S. and European Union for CERENIA, an antiemetic to treat and prevent acute vomiting in dogs and cats.", "We continue expanding the breadth of our FOSTERA swine vaccine franchise. We have new label claims in Canada and Latin America. And DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective which will tapped an important market for swine, was launched in additional European markets, such as Spain, Italy and Portugal.", "Now to achieve concerns, comments and update on the operational efficiency program, we announced that last quarter. I do want to recall the program we announced it to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate the resources for future long-term growth. We expect to generate cost savings of at least $300 million in 2017 and improve our adjusted EBITDA margin from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017, as we review complexity and achieve greater focus on key brands and markets.", "Our visual leader is moving ahead with elimination of approximately 5000 SKUs from our total of 13,000 and changing or solution model in about 25 markets. Approximately 45 countries will remain with our direct sales model and generate 95% of our revenue. Meanwhile, we have begun the process of selling or executing seven manufacturing sites. And another few sites will be sold or exited in a later phase as part of our supply network strategy. We've also started job reduction as we reorganize and streamline our operations. We're making very good progress on implementation of our operational efficiency program. And I'm very optimistic about delivering or exceeding the target of $300 million in savings by 2017.", "While we're making these changes on efficiency, we remain absolutely committed to the moment that has been driving our success. Our direct selling approach and world-class sales reinforce creating us from the competition. Our investment in relation, the drive breakthrough products and also ensure the lifecycle development of our portfolio and our high-quality manufacturing and supply.", "In summary, we deliver excellent second quarter operational resource; with various sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We remain well-positioned for profitable growth based upon on our core capabilities, diverse portfolio and focus on expansion growth. And we're seeing new initial progress on the efficiency program that made us get more competitive and profitable for the long term. I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?", "Paul Herendeen", "Good morning. The financial highlights of the quarter are regular growth and cost discipline. Revenues were up 11% operationally compared to Q3 in 2014 with growth coming principally from the addition of acquired Abbott Animal Health products, the ramp up of APOQUEL and of those and strength in our livestock portfolio.", "With respect to operating expenses, we especially took ownership to reduce expense in order to preserve our 2015 profit guidance in the face of currency headwinds and animal health growth of operating expenses to 2% on an operational basis compared to the prior-year quarter and keeps us on track to deliver on the 2015 portion of the efficiency initiative that we announced back in May.", "Strong revenue performance in animal gross profit margins mainly due to the favorable impact of FX on cost of goods sold and expense control enabled us to report very strong adjusted net income growth of 20% operationally and 14% on a reported basis. While the year looked no mean, we know what's coming next. While good performance in the 98% window looks great in the headline, we think about our business in terms of the year or even years.", "We don't guide to quarters and we don't manage the quarters so please view this quarter as a strong quarter and view it as what it is, an indication that we remain solidly on track to deliver our 2015 guidance and beyond. With that as a backdrop, I want to note that we narrowed our 2015 guidance towards the upper end of the range. Good stuff indeed. Our FX rate and I want to, again, call your attention the impact of FX on our reported results. Foreign exchange rates continued to mute our reported revenue and profit growth. FX rates reduced our reported sales by some $106 million compared to Q2 of 2014 or roughly 1,000 basis points, while adjusted net income growth was reduced by $12 million or roughly 600 basis points compared with the prior-year second quarter.", "We measure our performance on an operational basis or on a constant currency basis and on that basis, we delivered. As part of the operational efficiency program we announced in May, we consolidated from four of the reporting segments to two, U.S. and International. From here forward, our financial reporting will reflect this new structure.", "A few weeks ago we issued and 8-K to provide a historical view of our 2014 and third quarter 2015 results in this new reporting structure and I hope this helps you update the financial models and prepare for today's call. The consolidation of our business into two segments will reduce the cost and complexity of our operations and also improves our decision-making and accountability at the local market level where we drive value.", "It's real concerns that the consolidation segment might reduce visibility into our performance. Let me say that we believe that the revised disclosure providing revenue details on most on -- excuse me, providing revenue details on our most important countries rather than a somewhat arbitrary geographic grouping, should give you better visibility into the results and how we drive our results. And to at least organize the leads, you will see revenue for the U.S. and international segments as well as additional breakdown showing revenue for our top net 11 international countries.", "This gives you visibility into the markets that account for nearly 80% of our sales. Approximately 20% of remaining revenue are being grouped and reported as other developed markets and other emerging markets. I will caution you that with the increased granularity of the revenue we're reporting, you will see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and I would not read too much into that if you are looking at a single quarter in a single market in isolation.", "One of the strength of our business models is the geographic diversity of our revenue and profit streams, particularly in livestock. We participate in global markets and strength and weaknesses in digital markets are generally offset by performance in other markets. Finally, we also provided an important disclosure of the two segments, showing revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses and pre-tax earnings. I hope you will agree that our new financial reporting model is an improvement over the prior model. Let me call your attention to a few highlights from the quarter. Juan mentioned this earlier but it's worth repeating because it's a great way to illustrate the ways in which we can grow our top-line. Top-line as we knew.", "We delivered operational growth of 11% in the quarter, of which 3% was unit growth of in line products, 2% was from price, 2% was from growth of APOQUEL, 2% was from the additional acquired Abbott Animal Health products and 2% was from a range of new product introductions. I need to go second quarter, we covered all of the ways we certainly can deliver operational revenue growth.", "Next, looking at the U.S., very strong growth of 17% over the prior-year quarter, we delivered growth in all species, companion animal, cattle, swine, poultry and equine. In companion animals, the big drivers for the other share of the Abbott products and APOQUEL. In cattle, we had a continuation of favorable conditions to putting use of our premium products and we increased sales of the ACTOGAIN. In swine, product sizes impact from the PEDv outbreak and you had the positive impact of new products in the portfolio, the PEDv vaccine and medicine.", "Finally, poultry grew largely from the introduction of our ZOAMIX Project. In the international group which grew 6% operationally, the top three countries contributing to the growth for Brazil, up 9%, mainly due to the favorable conditions in the livestock segment and new product launches; China which was up 26%, with our livestock business benefiting from higher anti-infective use in some key swine accounts and growth in companion animal, driven by from momentum from [indiscernible]; and then finally in the UK which was up 12% based on strong performance of stronghold and the addition of the Abbott Animal Health products.", "We do have species international group; livestock was up 6%, with cattle and swine offsetting lower sales of poultry products. Companion animal group, 8% operationally, primarily from sales of APOQUEL in Spain, India and Germany. A pick-up in sales of swine products in Western Europe, Australia, Canada and China and strong vaccine sales in China.", "I should note that other emerging markets grew 10% operationally and that included growth in Venezuela. You will recall that we're reducing our activities in Venezuela pending an improvement in the economic environment there for multinational companies. We're slowing down on inventories in the country and we will limit our future exports to Venezuela. Accordingly, sales growth in this market will trend downward over the balance of the year and continue into 2016 at significantly lower levels. The impact of our reduced emphasis in Venezuela is reflected in our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017.", "Let me turn you to our operational efficiency initiative and I will give this from the finance guy perspective. I will start with the punch line. We're on track to deliver at least $300 million of operating expense reductions by calendar 2017. As we implement the changes needed to deliver those savings where we will intact the interconnected capabilities with [Technical Difficulty] advantage, our leading direct sales force, our highly productive R&D engine and our global supply chain.", "When we enter 2017, we will do so with a direct presence in all of the markets around the globe that matter. And we will be promoting a portfolio comprised of the products that matter to our customers and have the best prospects for delivering revenue and profit growth. We want to be transparent with we respect to one-time costs and I want to call your attention to targets in the second quarter and broken down into three buckets.", "First, the standup and other one-time costs which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaling $39 million in the quarter. The lion's share of the standup cost should be behind us at the Q2 of 2016. Next, we recorded $263 million with costs associated with operational efficiency initiative, mainly for 2017 after attributed by the changes to our organization. This included about $25 million in non-cash charges.", "And, finally, there's a bucket for our supply strategy which had $15 million of charges as we're still in the early stages of this initiative. You can see on our webcast line the current estimates of one-time costs expected to be recorded in 2015 to 2017. Please note the cash forecasts for these projects remains the same as our previous guidance.", "Next guidance to 2016, based on our strong performance in Q2, we now in a range for revenue and adjusted EPS towards the top end of our range for revenue to $4.7 billion to $4.775 billion and adjusted EPS to $1.63 to $1.68 per share. With respect operating expenses, as I said earlier, we made excellent progress comparing that of the operating expenses in the first half of 2015.", "It's real important to note that there are some natural seasonal trends to how we incur expenses. In 2014, we incurred 45% of our total operating expenses in the first half of the year and 55% in the second half, with Q4 being our highest expensed quarter. That's a trend that you'd expect to see continued into 2015 but we expect to have a balance between Q3 and Q4 than in the past which was more heavily loaded in Q4. Please keep that in mind as you think about the balance of this year.", "Turning to our longer-term guidance for 2016 and 2017, we're affirming our expectations for 2016 and 2017 and call your attention to the table that's included as part of our press release. While thinking about the longer-term, I want to point out that we assume a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding.", "As we said on our last call, but worth repeating, we intend to use our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilution related to the equity-based compensation that we provide to our colleagues. And I want to reiterate that the efficiency initiative will trigger an acceleration of some dilution and to those plans. During second quarter we repurchased 2.1 million shares for $98 million, an average price of $46.19 per share.", "Next, we saw that we recently filed on shelf registration statement. While we have no immediate plans to raise capital, the shelf provides us with the financial flexibility and access to capital markets quickly and when and if appropriate.", "Looking now ahead over the next six quarters or so, we had a number of calls with our cash including our standup cost, the cost of implementing the efficiency initiative, our dividend, ongoing share repurchases and a $400 million debt maturity in February of next year. So it makes sense to be prepared for that, right? That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the line for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And will take the first question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Ellich", "Ramon and wondering if you would give us a little bit more detail behind your comments on the APOQUEL supply and what is going on with the ERP in the implementation with the billing issues?", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "I will answer the APOQUEL question and then I will ask Paul to provide details of the presentation of the ERP, not only in the U.S. but also in other markets where we're implementing this new system. So in terms of APOQUEL, as I said we were able to increase significantly the supply from equity but still we're facing some challenge in ramping up and the manufacturing of API.", "And API is explaining some order of comments and it is a very complex manufacturing process and we had some delay in terms of permitting all the needs for finished goods. Now we have a process that in our opinion will meet the demands of the market and we expect that very soon we will be able to meet all the market demands in the power expectation.", "In 2015, as I said, we plan to sell about $153 million, 1.50 and that significantly increase the revenues in 2016. I'm very confident that the situation is under control. We have all the capacity that we need to use API and also to use the finished books in various in the market will start getting all the needs from our customers. For now Paul will provide an update", "Paul Herendeen", "Let me start by saying when we went live with the implementation SAP in the us in the beginning of May itself, high level and the go live was and continues to be a success and that is not to say that everything is perfect. I would say on the good side there is one reference and we have full control of our key business processes and we have full contact any of our financial information.", "We have work to do in addressing the ways in which our system changes and has enacted on our customers. The us segment of our business we interface with tens of thousands of customers and the overwhelming majority have been systems working well at that does not matter if you are a customer where our systems change has led to issues with respect to you and the customer so addressing all of those issues and it continues to be a top priority for us and we will continue to look at resources and about an outstanding issue and I'm sure you and others on the line including some of our customers this is something that Wanda and I think about every day.", "Last thing on this I hope is I've been involved in a number of SAP implementations and all of them have been successful and none of them have been without bumps in the road. We're going to call this implementation of success. Our customers are happy with the level of our customer service and we have work to do there and we're on it and we're on it every day.", "Operator", "And we will take next question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Louise Chen", "Paul, I know you don't manage the quarters but I was curious how we should think about third quarter and fourth quarter were qualitatively in terms of EPS progression because you did announce a meaningful beat and second quarter but you did not raise your guidance as much is the be. Thanks", "Paul Herendeen", "A couple of things let's talk about it in second half. Please keep in mind as I mentioned earlier during my prepared remarks that the net-net was down over the second half of the year and we paired our expectations to APOQUEL to the lower in communicated range. Still expected to sell more than four times last year's volume but towards the low end of our previously range for APOQUEL also bear in mind you're looking at our business in the second half of the year and our livestock business that's been chugging along quite nicely thinks some very tough comps in the second half of the year.", "So realistically from the revenue perspective if we're going to be making our guidance range and we think that's pretty good. We're on track for 15 and on track for 16 and on track for 17 picked out on the expense side which really has more of the question to of around income, the income and where it should be and to call out my prepared remarks and it's at 55% of our OpEx in last year came in the second half of our year.", "We're expecting similar phasing in the second half of this year although less pronounced than you saw last year between Q3 and Q4 so you really need to take that into account in order to think about the full-year. We tightened our guidance range. We continue to be on track and we think for a very solid 2015 with a lot of moving parts and on into '16 and '17.", "Operator", "And we will take next question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Erin Wilson", "Can you speak to the recent acquisition of KL progress in the poultry segment and will that be a meaningful contributor going forward and how should we think about capital deployment more broadly as it relates to acquisition and how would you characterize the deal pipeline right now and are you looking at both small and large target? Thanks.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "The first on the KL acquisition, it was a small acquisition but it's an indication that also enforce our presence in the country and will reinforce our presence also in the revised part of our business. So we're entering into a revised business some year ago and we have reason on [indiscernible] the ability to vaccinate and it's a very efficient device vaccinating up to 60,000 eggs per hour. Whether this device we're now -- KL problems but also we have strengthened our position in this part of the business. So it's more material but at the same time we also provide some additional relations with our customers and provide some additional service to them. Paul will respond to the capital deployment", "Paul Herendeen", "On the capital deployment I can't resist going through the whole sort of diagram of how we think about capital allocation. First and foremost we look for invest in our business and see opportunities to drive significant value for example increased investment through R&D and sales investment that, that would be our first call because we have a business that can generate organic growth in line or in the markets in which we compete with these investments and that would lead to a solid organic growth and earnings.", "Now next M&A is adamant to our organic growth it will be added to our organic growth, I think good example the Abbott acquisition earlier this year which is fitting in quite nicely and helping us with our results. We think we entered Q1 perhaps it might have been observed in that, we mentioned anatomy of line of sight towards completing the standup I described us as interested and ready to look at M&A opportunities that are out there in the market and we're looking for leverage in the places where we have expertise and where we can leverage our core capabilities, broad-spectrum we look at pipeline assets.", "We look at in-market products and technologies, we look at company acquisitions. I want to point out that we use a return date to evaluate transactions and we look for deals that add value and cash flow and retail will be value generated to our shareholders as we look to pursue those deals. We've got some capacity to do deals and we're interested in saying there are certainly areas that are adjacencies for us or areas where we currently like to do that", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "And we continue assessing any possibility [ph] that we make a strategic sense, we will generate synergies in terms of revenues and cost. We like the financial value. Also very important also we did incorporate into this assessment any antitrust in partners that we may have. That's really where we see M&A as a way to complement our internal growth, our operational growth and internal growth and that will increase the value of Zoetis and value to our shareholders.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "John Kreger", "My question relates to the atopic dermatitis franchise that you are building. Can you talk about how APOQUEL these additions versus the new IL-31 antibody and do you expect to do a full launch of the new antibody now or wait for more clinical data. Thanks", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "John. APOQUEL it's an oral treatment compared to IL-31 which is injectable. APOQUEL is a pill that need to be taken on acute and also chronic conditions of the dog. While IL-31 it's more injectable so it's different and it will depend also on the [indiscernible] but definitely we see both of the problems very complementary and maybe one much more focus on the first line treatment and while IL-31can be used more for chronic conditions and for those dogs that require some additional attention from veterinarians and follow-up from veterinarians. The full launch of the product will release when we get the full license. So at the beginning we plan to do the product -- we continue to review the methodologies in the U.S. and then we will gain details on the efficacy that the data will be used to present this information to the USDA and then finally get final approval for the license in about a year.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Chris Schott", "We have had several big presence [indiscernible] with APOQUEL and IL-31 and [indiscernible]. Can you talk about how you think about the anticipated case of additional R&D development, should we expect another large product launching every two years and every year and then just on business development you said in the past that you\u2019re looking to upgrade from smaller and mid-sized deals and that these opportunities tend to be more therapeutic and geographically focused. Are any therapeutic or geographic areas that are particularly attractive and are you interested in continuing to build-in devices or diagnostics? Thank you.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "I will try to go through all of the different questions that you raised starting with the path line. We're very pleased with the productivity of our investment in our R&D. We've been able to produce APOQUEL but also control that we're very strong players in terms of vaccines and we had the opportunity to use also the vaccine [indiscernible] in record time and now we have also IL-31 and that will also complement our franchise dermatology space and we also expect in 2016 gaining approval for an oral parasiticide that is an important segment and where we're today we're under represented.", "We expect to enter this product in both U.S. and also the European markets. Definitely we're focused on bringing innovation and, in my opinion now we're showing that we're leading not only in terms of revenue but also in terms of innovation that we've been showing many examples of how our team is delivering this kind of innovation.", "At the same time, we're continuing investing in the part which is equally important which is extending the lifecycle of our portfolio. And this will present a significant part of our investment in fact most of our R&D budget is located to ensure that our problems remain competitive and we achieve that by combining products, increasing indications and also geographical expansion.", "So we\u2019re very pleased with our innovation and pipeline, we definitely we like to see that these deliveries of this success continues in the future.", "In terms of business development, that you ask, we're now in a situation that we contemplate business development from a provisional first time. We have a significant presence in all of the therapeutic areas, we have facility presence in all geographies and also in all species but we still see opportunities some in cases between gaps that also strengthen our position.", "But it will be only when it makes sense from the financial point of view. In terms of other areas, we're very open to contemplate opportunities outside of our core business. We enter some into these complementary spaces, in genetics, devices and diagnostics and we will continue assessing opportunities in these areas that we will reinforce our position", "Paul Herendeen", "Before we for a jump off I want to go back to the kind of how do you think about the productivity or the pace coming out of R&D because it is one of our competitive trends. We often talk about and this is in round numbers, everybody, we often talk about our industry growing mid-single digits over time with if you thought of it is five using as an example, five is a 5% growth industry and 2% coming from units and 2% coming from price, 1% coming from new products. Our goal is to deliver more from self-developed products to the 1% and again I don't want to focus too often on one quarter but if you look in our quarter, second quarter of this year we have 2% of our growth year-over-year from introduction, products that have been in-line less than a year. Products like [indiscernible] collection of all other products that are in line for less than a year. So there is lots of things that are included in our R&D that are not in the same categories perhaps like an APOQUEL or Sarolaner or perhaps even an IL-31 but we go along and that growth is one, meaningful and two to the extent that we can grow faster in that market and that helps us deliver on one of our valued propositions which is our ability to grow our sales at a rate faster than the market.", "Operator", "Yes the next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company.", "Kathy Miner", "I was wondering if you could give us a little more of an update on your outlook for the livestock by species of cattle, swine and poultry and specifically as we get through the end of '15 and into '16 and also if you could point out what are the tough comparisons are for the second half that you mentioned earlier? Thank you.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Starting with livestock we see the market conditions are still favorable. If we start with cattle, the price of beef remains high. We see that also the value of the animals remain very high and this also creates an opportunity to continue providing [indiscernible] producers the problems that they need to keep the animals healthy and productivity. Swine and poultry are also two species that have been performing very well, swine in this quarter represented the growth of 14% while in the quarter poultry was showing only 1% but one of the advantages of Zoetis is that we have a presence in all species and we can really maximize opportunities despite of some temporary challenges in one species or one in geography. So in that respect we see that the prospect for livestock remain positive and we see that continually in 2016.", "Paul Herendeen", "The other question was to talk about the tougher comparison in livestock compared to last year. You look back in the second half 2014 and we had margins or significant ramp up of [indiscernible] and things like that in the prior-year that were not present in the first half of 2014 and the compared year. So that's what leads to more difficult comparison year-over-year. in the livestock space.", "Operator", "Next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Alex Arfaei", "Paul, can you give us your thoughts and expectations regarding potential tax reform in the U.S. which seems to be gaining traction and specifically for your company as we [indiscernible] important goal for your tax rate and follow-up if I make strong performance in Brazil driven by new product launches, are these products that are already available in other major markets or can we expect similar launches for these products? Thank you.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Looking at the first tax question is, tax is on [indiscernible] going on forever but it doesn't mean it won't create some traction but it's important to our structure and the answer is it could be to the extent that we have earnings and cash that's offshore and part of our tax structure partly intend to permanently deploy that capital offshore, the rules are changing, it affect us just like any other U.S. multinational company. So we will just have to wait and see on that", "Paul Herendeen", "Let me then answer to your question about product traction in other markets. We see in general that companion animals are more global produce and this is something we have that products in that segment [indiscernible] in all markets around the world and this has been the case of APOQUEL and also would be the case of IL-31 and some of the products in these categories. In terms of livestock, it depends.", "You asked about the Brazil, Brazil is a very strong market in terms of cattle but also the cattle industry we have very specific conditions and we have been introducing definitely new product but in some cases very specific to Brazil and more recent interaction has been produce for reproduction that has been produce introduce in Brazil at the end of 2014. We will continue to try to expand our portfolio as much as we can geographically and definitely this is part of our potential growth ensuring that we have all of the heavy market introducing in all of our markets.", "Operator", "We will go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Mark Schoenebaum", "The growth in the third quarter I just want to continue the question about the tax. So I'm wondering how much tax optimization or tax planning are already included in the long-term guidance because it looks like the effective tax continues to be between 29% and 30% for the next two years.", "How much is already tax planning that was already included in the new guidance and if there is any additional potential to optimize further the tax rate in the longer term? And somewhat related to the question about M&As, what rates would be interested in introductions and for purposes whether [indiscernible] interested in merging with the company which is not truly animal health. Thank you", "Paul Herendeen", "So first question how much is included in our long-term guidance? We\u2019ve a structure I think we\u2019ve articulated that we think we have a solid structure based on the hand that we're dealt here that will allow us to maintain a tax rate in the order of call it 29%-ish for the planning horizon for us at goes out at least three years that we provided guidance. We talked many times and we look for any opportunity to grind that rate down and it is a grind. It is not something that there is a magic bullet that we can put in place in the new structure and magically reduce our tax rate by 700 basis points.", "We do what we can and we think we have a good solid supportable structure and that\u2019s what is included in our guidance over the long-term. With respect to an inversion, we talk about this as well. In our there are precious few companies that would make sense for us to work with and the second thing that we try to talk about at our investor day back in November of last year is based on our particular set of circumstances we feel that in an inversion transaction the benefit if you focus on the entity that\u2019s currently called Zoetis an offshore [indiscernible] debt would be roughly reduce our tax rate by some 600 basis points market folks are suggestive that there are other ways that could be pretty dramatically beyond that and that's our point of view and that's what we said back in November and we continue to believe that. So in terms of the transaction it could be helpful and it's not something that for us would take our tax rate down into the one-time single digits", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "So we haven't distributed any option but you have to think about this opportunity that can be justified not only because of tax but because of the strategic rational of the position and this is something that we include in the assessment.", "Operator", "We will go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It's [indiscernible] filling for Dave, so I have a question on pricing. Wondering whether some of this can raise prices in livestock and companion animal anymore then you have in the past?", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "We're always trying to maximize gross profit and the opportunity to maximize gross profit is coming from including the volume, including prices and finding the right balance between volume and price. And we will find good strategy in terms of prices and definitely see opportunities to raise prices at the higher pace and we would consider that. We have been quite aggressive and price increases in some of the emerging markets and where we have high inflation and then because of that we're also applying high price increases. In developed markets what we're trying to also is make sure we remain competitive and we're not creating a negative impact in our volume that also we have impacted revenue in terms of cost of manufacturing. All of these is part of what we consider in terms of price increases. ", "Operator", "Next question comes from Jeff Holford and this will be our final question today. Jeff, go ahead.", "Jeff Holford", "So as well as operational efficiency program being very good for helping the efficiency of the overall business, you did talk on last quarter's call about how this might make Zoetis much better platform for integrating acquisitions. Can you just give us a bit more feel of when this process would progress through to the point where less focus on drug in the process and the platform is more efficient and you might be able to consider larger size deals because I would assume at the moment with a lot of work still do on this program, that\u2019s not something that should be in the cards right now. Thank you.", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "On the primary it's running and in my opinion it's running at full speed. So we will be finalizing all of the necessary changes at the end of this year and there will be also a significant work done in terms of reduction of SKUs and also changing the internal markets. I don't see at this point that our operational efficiency program is any kind of restriction, or creating any kind of restriction for M&A.", "On the contrary now we have an operation that is a key endpoint and we can really maximize the opportunities for any position with the model that will be more profitable. So they will start running well in terms of our program. I don't see any concern or issue on delivering or exceeding the target of 600 million and at the same time considering the M&A opportunities.", "Paul Herendeen", "The operating efficiency initiative is not a gaining factor looking at our M&A opportunities. The best time to do a deal is when there is an attractive actionable deal in front of you, what I expressed earlier was we're ready and we would be able to take advantage of the situation if we could present itself, we\u2019re good to go.", "Operator", "We will take that from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Arielle in for Jami. I just wanted to follow up on the M&A question. Can you discuss your firepower. You mentioned on many calls that you\u2019re somewhat cash restrained with operational efficiency, so are you able to do a large scale deal and can you remind us what your max leverage ratio you are comfortable with? Are you willing to use equity and then just secondly there has been a lot of restrictions with antibiotic usage and livestock so can you just give provide color at what is the downside risk for your business. Thanks", "Paul Herendeen", "We're thinking about M&A let's go back and start and answer the capital structure question first, we might express an upper bound of what we would put on in terms of leverage but what we have said is we're generally thinking about target for as roughly 2.5 turns of EBITDA in our cap structure and the expectation is in the normal course ranging 2.5 to 3.5 times somewhere in that vicinity. Now what we have also said is that we have the right opportunity we would be more aggressive in the use of debt capital in order to be able to complete a value generative transaction.", "So what does that mean? It means that we look to balance our desire to maintain a solid credit profile and access the capital with how much debt we put on and having a clear pathway to reducing the leverage over a period of time. We have the capacity to do good sized deals within our company. And as I said the best time to do deals is when there is an opportunity in front of you and we would use all available leverage in order to be able to formed and conclude the transaction that we felt was value generative for all the shareholders", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "And then let me take the question on what is the potential risk. We have in our portfolio about 30% of our revenues coming from antibiotics. Out of this 30%, 25% is a companion animal and we see low risk and then the rest is between MSAs and also injectable products which again we see less risk than probably is provided to animals in feed.", "There are different levels of categories on the use of antibiotics, [indiscernible] and also the different species where the problems arise. There has been a significant rumors or comments mainly in poultry where some of the producers have decided to move away from medical important antibiotics and to use non-medical important antibiotics. We have in our portfolio both and we think we can provide to our producers, mainly poultry activity produce that will meet their demand and also meet also consumer demand.", "So in our opinion I think it is a risk that is manageable and the advantage that I mentioned in many occasions we have a portfolio which is extremely diverse in terms of species, in terms of geographies and in terms of specific areas and also very important in terms of specific areas when they move away from antibiotics they need to increase significantly the use of vaccines to protect this animal. So again we have a significant presence in vaccines so we can compensate any kind of impact on certain areas and have increased in others.", "Operator", "It appears we have no further questions at this time so I will turn the floor back over to Juan Ramon for any closing remarks", "Juan Ramon Alaix", "Thank you very much for attending this call and thank you very much for your questions and again we think that we reported this quarter very strong results and we're very confident on delivering our objective in 2015. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in in two hours by dialing 800-695-0395 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-1388 for international.

LLC", "Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC", "Operator", "Good day and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.", "The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.", "At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation.", "In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups.", "It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. You may begin, sir.", "John O'Connor - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a full list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including but not limited to our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 16, 2016. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "With that I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. In today's call I will provide perspective color based on the performance for the full year 2015 and our goals for 2016. Paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights, the 2015 net results and our guidance for 2016 and 2017.", "In 2015, we affirm Zoetis' reputation as the global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance, continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating a value for our customers and shareholders.", "For 2015 our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by 8% operationally, with particular strength coming from R&D innovations and acquired products from Abbott Animal Health.", "In our three years as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and we expect our 2015 to show again that we are growing faster than the industry. We grew our adjusted net income by 24% operationally, and grew our adjusted EBIT margin from 25% to 28% as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business.", "Even while we are scrutinizing our efficiency, we also continue to allocate resources for future growth. We invested $1.6 billion in 2015 across strategic acquisitions, internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply. And finally, in 2015 we returned approximately $370 million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "This performance reflects our disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues' tremendous dedication to serving our customers. I am pleased to say that as a result we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in 2015.", "On a reported basis we had a flat revenue growth due to an 800 basis point impact from foreign currency, but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by 13% thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals.", "Looking ahead to 2016, first and foremost we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are projecting 2% to 4% operational revenue growth, which reflects the impact of our SKU realization and changes to our operations in Venezuela. Excluding those impacts, we expect to grow revenues 8% to 10% operationally with 2 percentage points coming from the addition of PHARMAQ. This means organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again.", "And for 2017 we expect to continue growing faster than market at the rate of 5% to 9% as we are confident in our end markets, business model, the prospects for new product launches, improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals. We are also confident in our pricing strategy. Our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers who buy and pay for the products we completely independent of third-party payers.", "In January we updated our adjusted EPS guidance for 2016 and 2017 to reflect the impact of the European Commission decision on our tax rate. Today we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in Venezuela, which will have a negative impact of $0.06 in 2016 and $0.08 in 2017.", "Our second objective for 2016 is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our long-term revenue growth. We are increasing supply for APOQUEL and also launching in new markets. This growth already surpassed $100 million with a limited availability in 2015, and we see significant room to grow from this level with long-term peak sales of more than $300 million.", "Another important breakthrough in the area of dermatology, our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the U.S. to veterinarians and dermatologists, and we are preparing for global market availability later in 2016.", "Meanwhile SIMPARICA, a new oral parasiticide, will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products, a market of approximately $3 billion. SIMPARICA was approved in the EU later last year, and we are awaiting approval in the U.S. this quarter. We expect the launch in both the U.S. and EU in the first quarter of 2016, and see sales ramp up during the year.", "Our third major objective this year is enhancing the supply and customer service, an area where we fell short last year. As we continue with our supply network strategy, we are making steady improvements, most notably in APOQUEL. We're also investing to build capacity in product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base.", "In the near term we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants, focused on expanding the set of products will improve our performance. We also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new Enterprise Resource Planning system, or ERP, in the first quarter. The ERP will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business. And we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year; we'll make certain we are exceeding our customers' expectations.", "Our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure, investment in R&D and business development. We are making a good progress in shaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency plan we announced last May. That work has been accelerated, and the additional cost savings has been included in our guidance.", "It is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans, we have remained committed to building the three interconnected capabilities that drive our success with customers: U.S. sales, innovative R&D, and high quality and reliable manufacturing and supply. The implementation has been resourced, even as we go through changes in other areas of the company.", "Our investment in R&D continues showing high return and support for our future growth. I am very pleased to say that our efforts to refresh our portfolio with innovative vaccines offerings, especially in companion animal are paying off. Last year, we launched a new combination vaccine for dogs across the EU called Versican Plus, and has been very well received by customers.", "In the fourth quarter, Zoetis was granted a conditional license from the USDA to market our canine influenza vaccine, the first conditional licensed vaccine to help control disease associated with canine influenza, the virus that is H3N2.", "In December, we received our U.S. license for VANGUARD crLyme, a vaccine that aids in the prevention of conditions associated with Lyme disease in dogs. And in November, we expanded our INNOVATOR horse vaccine franchise in the U.S. with the launch of our vaccine to aid in the prevention of leptospirosis.", "Meanwhile in aquatic health, shortly after closing our deal with PHARMAQ in the fourth quarter, one of their new vaccines for salmon received an emergency license in Chile, one of the world's largest farmed fish markets.", "Our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications and formulation of existing products. In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for CERENIA, which allow for intravenous administration during the surgical protocols that use medication that induces vomiting.", "We launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE, a reproductive product for use in dairy and beef cattle, in the U.S. We are also viewed as a partner of choice, for all innovators in the industry.", "In January we enter into an agreement with Anatara Lifesciences, a company in Australia. We'll be evaluating their non-antibiotic, anti-infective product as an alternative to antibiotics that could treat and control infections in farm animals.", "And finally, in terms of business development, we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities like we did last year with Abbott Animal Health and PHARMAQ, while we continue with our internal investment in new products, lifecycle innovation and research alliances.", "In summary, we delivered an excellent 2015, built in our diverse and market-leading portfolio of products for animal health. We are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing complexity, achieving efficiencies, and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities. And we remain well positioned as the industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health.", "With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks. Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Let me put an exclamation point on Juan Ram\u00f3n's overview of 2015. What a terrific year we had. If you think back to a year ago, we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us, most notably, the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in May, and also the rollout of our enterprise-wide SAP system in our most important market, the U.S., as well as many other key locations around the world. I can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company, on our colleagues, and in some cases impacted our customers. But we were able to stay on task, overcome many challenges, and deliver results that we're very proud of.", "So let's talk about our performance. We had very strong sales growth in the U.S., up 13% for the full year, driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle, the addition of Abbott Animal Health, and increased supplies of APOQUEL. In the international business we delivered operational sales growth of 4%, which reflected good performance in major markets like Brazil and China, which grew 11% and 17% respectively, partially offset by the business changes that we are making in Venezuela.", "We reduced our total operating expenses by 1% on an operational basis in 2015 compared with 2014 while growing revenue 8% operationally. We kicked off our efficiency initiative in May and were able to capture meaningful savings in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by 3% on an operational basis while we were growing revenue 7% operationally.", "To be fair, the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we are making will come over the long term. Anyone can cut costs and improve profits in the short term. The challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate. To do that, you need to be thoughtful about where, how, and how much you reduce costs. We continue to prioritize and spend behind activities that deliver value to our customers and therefore support our growth, namely our sales forces, our R&D engine, and our supply chain, so very good stuff for the full year 2015.", "Let me turn to the quarter quickly. You can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables, but let me hit on a few highlights, focusing on themes that may be impactful on our future results, starting with revenue. Again, good operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter coming against a very strong quarter in 2014. Next, improvement in operating efficiency; total operating expenses were down 8% operationally in the quarter, and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally.", "Foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multi-nationals. Changes in FX rates reduced Q4 reported revenue growth compared with the prior-year quarter by some 900 basis points. There's a word for that; it's brutal.", "Setting aside FX, we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational; that is, constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, the 6% operational revenue growth included 3% from increased APOQUEL sales due to better supply, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increases across the portfolio, and 1% from new products. Yet these drivers were partially offset by a 3% decline of in-line product revenues. I want to point out that's primarily related to ongoing changes to our business model in Venezuela and other countries like India, which were initiated as part of our efficiency program.", "As I said previously, the changes we have made and are making to our business model in certain markets impacted our second half 2015 performance and will have impact on our 2016 revenue growth. But these changes improve our prospects for longer-term revenue and profit growth. That's the prize.", "In the case of Venezuela, you'll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions for multi-national companies. We've been selling down our inventories in the country, limiting our future exports to Venezuela, and this quarter we decided to revalue our assets and liabilities there, based on the free floating SIMADI exchange rate.", "In the case of India, we remain committed to our business there, especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses, with a direct field force. However, we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment. That segment has not consolidated in the way that we had expected over the last several years, and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs.", "It's worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes Venezuela and India, and declined 3% operationally in the fourth quarter. If you want to go back and you can exclude India and Venezuela, other emerging markets would have grown by 12%. The other emerging markets segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in 2016, as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the SKU reductions, as well as market changes that we are undertaking as part of our efficiency programs.", "While I'm on the subject of international markets, I know there continues to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like China and Brazil, given lots of recent media reports about their slower GDP growth and their economic outlooks. Generally, demand for animal health products is tied to more stable growth drivers, mainly the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets, both of which move as a function of population, income, and urbanization.", "Fundamentals in the animal health segments of both China and Brazil remain strong, and here's the proof. For the full year 2015, we grew revenue in China and Brazil on an operational basis 17% and 11% respectively. In the fourth quarter, China and Brazil grew 14% and 10% respectively. Both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid. And so I pose the question rhetorically. Why is that?", "For China it's two things. One is the fact that the consumption of animal proteins in China is growing and has continued to grow even in challenging economic times. Second is the goal of the Chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity, safety, and quality of their food supply. That means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model, and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business. Now frankly, as I'm saying this, the second factor should be the first. It's a powerful driver, and it will last for many years.", "Now turning to Brazil, Brazil is a very developed livestock market, and domestic consumption of animal protein is only a part of the equation. Brazil is a significant exporter of meat. And so to the extent that the consumption falls within their borders, they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses. With the weakness of the real, exports are even more attractive today. So counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in Brazil, the Brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong.", "Using China and Brazil as examples, the key takeaway should be that we operate in an industry that's very resilient. Now I use that word quite a bit, even in times of economic stress, and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets.", "Turning to restructuring charges, this quarter we had significant one-time costs that drove a decrease in our reported GAAP net income and earnings per share. Let me explain this quarter's major charges in terms of the three buckets that we use.", "First, the standup costs which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $34 million in the quarter. That work will be substantially completed by mid-2016. We recorded $4 million of costs associated with our supply network strategy, and we are still in the early days of that initiative. And we also recorded $52 million of one-time costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of 2015.", "And finally, we have taken accounting actions related to the revaluation of our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities in Venezuela this quarter. We believe it's appropriate to change to the SIMADI rate as our exchange rate for Venezuela. And accordingly, we recorded charges of approximately $93 million in the fourth quarter.", "In the fourth quarter, we also announced the sale or exit of five manufacturing sites in the U.S., India and Taiwan, which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of $80 million of cash during 2016.", "Turning to guidance, we've provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the changes in our guidance for 2016 and 2017, to spotlight the impact of changes in FX rates and changes to our operations in Venezuela. We now expect for the full year 2016 revenue of between $4.65 billion to $4.775 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.30 and $1.48 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.71 and $1.81 per share.", "For full year 2017, we expect revenue between $4.95 billion and $5.15 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.95 and $2.13 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.18 and $2.32 per share. Our revised guidance reflects the impact of the European Commission's decision on Belgium's tax rulings and the related effect on our earnings, which we disclosed in early January.", "Our effective tax rate on adjusted pre-tax income is expected to be approximately 33% in 2016 and 30% in 2017. In January we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 and 2017 by $0.13 and $0.06 per share respectively. Note that we expect to record one-time net tax charges during 2016 of approximately $55 million, of which approximately $35 million to $45 million will be recorded in Q1.", "These Q1 charges relate to the nullification of our Belgium tax ruling by the European Commission for the periods from 2013 through 2015. Included in the total $55 million charge is an estimate of a future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our Belgium operation. You can see these $55 million of one-time costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for 2016.", "Our revised guidance today also reflects our latest views of our operations in Venezuela, updated FX rates as of the end of January, and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts. Here's some really good news. Other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the EC ruling, a factor over which we had no control, we're holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both 2016 and 2017.", "We expect the momentum that we carried through Q4 combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of FX rates and the change to our business model in Venezuela. Yeah, we're proud of that.", "And since I have the floor and I like to talk about our company, here's my summary of the year. Looking back at 2015, what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid mid-single-digit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world. And you saw our company, Zoetis, deliver strong operational growth of revenue, up 8%, by pulling on all of the levers that we have available to us: the best animal health sales forces on the planet, the most productive R&D team in the industry, value-generative M&A, and a supply chain that is a core strength of the company.", "And we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of 24% for the year. And I'm going to repeat that because it's awesome. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 increased 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.77 per share. I call out the $1.77 because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis, at the end of the day we put an actual dollar amount on the tape.", "Way back in November of 2014 we put 2015 guidance on the \u2013 excuse me \u2013 2015 guidance on the table. We guided revenue in the range of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 to $1.68. Since that time, we, like many multinational companies, have been battered by FX that dramatically reduced our reported revenues. But here's where we're different from many of those other multinationals. Throughout 2015 we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share and in November of 2015 we actually raised the range to $1.70 to $1.74. And now we report actual results of $1.77 per share.", "We're able to do that because we as a management team brought forward a plan in May of last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure and then we as a team got after it and reduced and controlled expenses to give us the best shot in delivering to you, our shareholders, the best earnings we could under the circumstances. As I love to say, pretty good.", "So here's my pitch. The global animal health industry is not just resilient; it has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable mid-single-digit growth. And the number one company in the global animal health industry is Zoetis. In the three years since we've been public, we've put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers.", "First, we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or faster than the mid-single-digit growth rate expected for our industry. Second, we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins, delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth. And third, we can intelligently allocate our capital; actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits.", "In today's dystopian financial markets where investors may be looking for shelter from the storm, I think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetical order and start with Z for Zoetis.", "That's it for my prepared remarks. Let's get to Q&A. Keith?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Okay. We can take our first question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Paul, could you just go back to the contributions from acquisitions in the quarter? I kind of missed those prepared remarks. And then, Juan Ram\u00f3n, I wanted to get an update on SIMPARICA as well. I think in the press release it says you expect approval now in Q1. I think previously you said first half of 2016 so I guess what's the change and what should we expect heading into Western Vet?", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I'll start, Kevin. Good morning. It's Paul. I'll start with the components of the growth. We had 6% operational revenue growth in the quarter and we recognize the goal was whole percentages here so there's rounding that comes into play but it was 3% from increased APOQUEL sales, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increase across the portfolio, and 1% from new products. Then the offset to that was about a 3% decline of what I guess we'll call revenues of all other products. And again, that is primarily related to the change in the business model in Venezuela and countries like India and places that were affected by our efficiency initiative. I hope that answers the question.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Paul. I will take the question on the SIMPARICA. So we submitted to the FDA all the information and based on the normal timing for approval, we expect SIMPARICA to be approved in the U.S. in the first quarter. This all will be depending on final decision of the FDA. Next question, please?", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I do see slide 18 in your presentation but I was wondering if you could help us better understand the underlying sales growth for the year without the impact from restructuring and SKU reductions? And then also, do you expect your sales growth to accelerate after these programs are completed? And when might we actually see that? Thanks.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Louise, its Paul. Let me take that, and thank you for asking the question, Louise, because if you just take the headline and say, gee, we're looking at 2% to 4% operational growth in revenue next year, people say, what's up with that? So let's start with from the 2% to 4%, the operational efficiency initiative, the effect on SKUs, and now Venezuela and other markets where we're going to change our model, reduced that by some 600 basis points. You can see that if you look at that slide 18, 600 basis points. So there's 8% to 10% if you're thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in 2016 v. 2015. And if you want to take PHARMAQ out of the equation and go what's the organic portion of that, it's about 200 basis points.", "So as you look at that slide, again I'll call everyone's attention to it, we tried our level best to help you think about the strength of 2016 because this is quite a strong year by showing you this waterfall slide. So 2% to 4%, 600 basis points on the efficiency initiative, SKU reductions, Venezuela, India, et cetera, gets you to 8% to 10%, and if you want to look at that on an organic basis it would be 6% to 8% by taking PHARMAQ out of the mix.", "Before I concede the floor, I want to say two things before I talk about 2016, because we did change from 3% to 5% operational growth to 2% to 4%. That is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our 2015 guidance for revenue. And as you saw, we had strong revenue in Q4, and for 2015 it was about $25 million higher than that. And that accounts for the change from 3% to 5% down to 2% to 4%. We feel really good about what we put on the table in 2015. And as we think about it, we really are excited about 2016, even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we are making to our model.", "Now last before I concede the floor, you asked the question about what could we expect in 2017. We expect a return to the same kind of solid growth that you would have expected in 2016 but for the change in the efficiency initiative. We're currently forecasting on an operational basis 5% to 9%. That's pretty solid, and that's being driven mainly by new products. Next question, please.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning, folks. Thank you for all the details on the slides and congratulations on a strong operational performance in 2015. Paul, cost of sales grew at a higher rate than revenues in the quarter, and as a result gross margin was lower year over year and sequentially versus 3Q. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts there on gross margin.", "And just a general question for the both of you, your stock has obviously been underperforming despite this strong operational performance. I'm wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that. And is there an opportunity for a more aggressive share buyback at these levels? Thank you.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, it's Paul. I'll take the Q4 margin. That was predominantly due to FX. Again, I would look at the full year and how we came out, and it was in line with what we were expecting. I know, Alex, we've traveled together a little bit. You look at a quarter; there can be a lot of variability that sneaks into the equation. You compare it against this, that and the other thing. Things happen in a 90-day period that smooth themselves out over the year. I would look at the 65%-odd margin that we put on the board for the full year, and that's indicative of the strength. But the one thing in the fourth quarter was FX. FX is hard to forecast when it flows through cost of sales, but it sure does.", "The second thing I think you asked a question about the share price. We're watching our company along with many others lose value, at least in the eyes of shareholders or people who are holding our stock. We continue to do what we can do. We're driving real fundamental value. You posed the question about our share buyback and the scale of that, et cetera. I'd point out that when we were last in the window I guess, which was in the early part of November, the stock was $43 \u2013 $44, I think, and I'm going from memory here, $43 \u2013 $44. And we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases. As everybody can do the math, we bought about $50 million a quarter through 2015. We're currently buying stock back at a pace of about $75 million a quarter. I know that's not a ton. But as I said also many times, we had a lot of calls on cash in 2016, but even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares. So I hope that answers the questions.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I will add a comment here, Alex. I think that in many cases our company is still associated with the human pharmaceutical industry. And discussions on prices, for instance, have been affecting the human pharmaceutical industry, while this should not be having any impact in our share value. Our prices, as I mentioned in my comments, are completely dependent on third-party payers. We price based on the value that we can demonstrate to our customers, and our customers are not only buying and paying the products they buy from us. So this is something that in my opinion should be also included when different investors or analysts also define the value of Zoetis and also the value of the animal health industry in general.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And the next question is from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse.", "Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great, thanks for taking my questions. How should we think about the quarterly progression of the U.S. livestock business? And could you characterize the overall health of the U.S. livestock industry just more broadly?", "And then one on R&D; on the parasiticide front, should we expect that you're ready to launch as soon as SIMPARICA gets approval in the U.S.? And then with the potential flea, tick, and heartworm combination chewable product, longer term, how long in the pipeline, or how far along in the pipeline is this product? And when should we expect it I guess to launch, and is it in the guidance?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So thank you, Erin, for your question. In terms of the launch of SIMPARICA, we are ready to launch as soon as we get approval from the FDA. We're also ready to launch not only in U.S. but also in the European markets. And the team is ready, the plans are in place, and we have a product to supply to the market.", "You also asked a question about the livestock progression in the U.S. And definitely we have seen that in general the livestock has been performing well in 2015. In terms of the quarters, the fourth quarter has been stronger than expected because already in the last year, we reported very strong revenue growth, and in this year also we grew significantly. And in terms of the different areas of livestock, we see also opportunities in cattle, we see opportunities in poultry, and we see opportunities also in swine. We expect also in 2016, the momentum will continue. We see positive trends in the cattle industry, mainly on beef; that we expect that the number of animals will increase by 3% or 3.5%. And this will expect, also will drive additional use of animal health products. And you also asked about...", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The combination product.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The flea and tick and the heartworm. Definitely, our R&D team is working on developing this product and finalizing all the information for submitting all the dossiers to the FDA. We have not yet communicated when we plan to have this product into the market. As we get closer to the finalization of all the different filings, then we'll communicate to the market. And this has not been included in our guidance for 2017. So next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi, thanks very much. You mentioned that you had some issues last year with customer service. I think you said mainly around APOQUEL. Can you just expand upon that? Is that issue behind you? How comfortable are you that you will not have any residual issues as we move through 2016?", "And then, Paul, maybe just talk a little bit more about longer term, your tax rate thoughts? Do you think 30% is the long term right number to use, or is there an opportunity to maybe push that lower? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So we have had supply issues for APOQUEL, and the supply issue has been resolved now. We have now the process for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that had been the bottleneck of manufacturing APOQUEL. We have a process which is much more robust and much more consistent. And we are really producing all the product that will be delivered in 2016, and we'll increase significantly the supply to the market. We are also planning to expand APOQUEL to the rest of the world in where the product has been approved, and we plan to do that in 2016. So we are convinced that APOQUEL will deliver significant growth and all the issues that we faced in 2015 will be behind us.", "We also reported in 2015 that the implementation of the new ERP also created some issues in terms of deliveries of products into the market. We are very pleased now how the implementation of the ERP has been now performed in the U.S. We have now 90% of our orders delivered the same day, which is a significant achievement, and we are working on improving there, the rest of the functions that also are provided to the customers. We expect that also the ERP, will be supporting our operations in a very efficient way in 2016. And this is something we plan to finalize all implementation of the new system in this quarter, and then moving forward, to maximize the way that we'll be supporting our business.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "John, its Paul. I'll take the tax question. First let me just say we were very disappointed with the European Commission's kind of stating that the Belgium tax rulings like we had are illegal, and essentially nullified our arrangement there. We're disappointed because the Belgians have been very supportive; we've built a terrific operation there. I think I've said in a prior public forum, the Belgians on the contrary, have been one of the more responsible countries with respect to tax policy and how they used it to attract employment and investment into their country and it's a shame.", "So set that aside, we're very disappointed. It obviously was not something that we were planning on. And let's pretend that, that didn't happen for a second. We had previously articulated, we thought our tax rate in, call it 2017, would have been on the order of 28%, our adjusted ETR roughly 28%, and now it's 30%. So we lost a couple of hundred basis points there in 2017. But what I would suggest to you is, just as we had articulated with respect to our structure before this happened, we can grind that down, but we wouldn't be grinding it down.", "The frustrating thing for us is, we were doing pretty well, fine tuning our global operating model to be efficient and here we have to go back and we have to change course a little bit. So not something \u2013 it was not a happy day for us but we're responding the best way that we can. And I think the way we look at it is we just add 200 basis points higher ETR in 2017 and our job is to grind that down. Next question, please.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of here. First, on the 6% impact from the SKU reduction in 2016, I guess now that we're further along in that process, any surprises in terms of customer behavior, in terms of the SKU changes? And I guess is there an opportunity for that number to be lower than 6%, either through uptake of alternatives of those products, or just other initiatives you put in place?", "And the second question which is as we're looking out 2016, just any dynamics we should be keeping in mind for modeling this year in terms of quarterly progression? I guess are there any particularly difficult or easy comps that we should be watching as we're kind of thinking about the quarters this year? Thanks very much.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Chris. What we evaluated very carefully when we decided to reduce SKUs on how will be the impact to our customers, we made sure that none of the SKUs that we are eliminating has no alternative to our customers. These alternatives can be from our competitors or can be alternatives, in our portfolio. The 6% impact in our revenues is the net result of reduction and also the assumption that some of these reductions of SKUs will be moved to other SKUs in our portfolio.", "In terms of reaction from our customers, I think in some cases, well, they will like to have these products in their portfolio, but they also understand that more important than offering 13,000 SKUs is ensuring that we have a reliable supply. What we want to make sure that when they place an order, they get the order on time to treat or protect the animals. And this is one of the important strategic rationales for our SKU rationalization. It was not only to improve gross margin, but also to ensure that our supply to the market is much more consistent and we can meet all customer submissions. And then Paul will take the question on the phasing in terms of quarters.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I think there are two things that I'd be mindful of; one is how the SKU reduction plays out with respect to our revenues. You'll recall that we announced this program in the middle part of 2015, and so we're just starting to see here in Q4 an alignment to Q1 and Q2, the impacts of the SKU rationalization. And it will be relative to the prior year, it will be a significant factor. But we will have to keep our eye on.", "The second part is with respect to our cost, our efficiency initiative. We continue to ramp up the amount of savings that we are seeing flow through, and of course the first half of last year we had a modest amount of cost containment or that occurred in the first half, but that steps up and we currently are tracking, as you saw, with an 8% operational reduction in operating expenses in Q4, tracking at a much lower rate, so that will be a very helpful driver on the operating expense side in the first half of the year, and then that benefit, if you will, comparing back to the prior year will moderate over the second half of the year.", "I think that's about all we want to cover on phasing. Just lastly, I'll say it again and again and again, we look at our business on a yearly basis. Trying to \u2013 I know you have to and that's what you do and all, and we'll try to be as helpful as we can with respect to the phasing but we run our business on an annual basis. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.", "Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Just a couple. First, Paul, maybe you can answer this. On the 2% contribution from price, can you talk about the outlook? How did that look on a global basis U.S. versus outside of the U.S.? And what is the outlook for price increases going forward both in the U.S. and across different geographies.", "And then, Juan Ram\u00f3n, just a question for you; as you are now, congratulations, three years as an independent company and it's been very exciting to see how Zoetis has evolved and achieved such tremendous success in a short period of time. Congratulations. But maybe you could just sort of step back and tell us \u2013 when I look at the industry, the animal health industry, it doesn't seem that a whole lot has changed. It still remains highly fragmented. We've seen a little bit of movement with Novartis swapping its business to Lilly. You've made a couple small acquisitions. But by and large, the industry hasn't changed much. Do you see more consolidation going forward? Or do you see some of your peers spinning out their animal health businesses like you have done for yourself? And what does this all mean for your future in terms of M&A? Thanks very much.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jami. And I will try to answer both questions. So in terms of the 2%, so the 2%, as you mentioned, it's a global increase. And in terms of where we see this 2% in the different geographies, definitely we have been very consistent in the U.S. with price increases of around 2%. And in the rest of the markets, it depends. So in high inflationary markets, we increased significantly the prices to compensate for inflation and also to compensate for foreign exchange.", "In some markets where the economies are \u2013 the inflation is very stable or probably not having any inflation at all, so we are also trying to adjust our prices based on these situations. So in Europe or Japan and some other markets we have been increasing prices but at a lower rate than in the U.S. or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation.", "The second question was related to the consolidation of the industry and the top four or five now animal healthcare companies represent almost 70% of the total market, which has already been increased significantly from some years ago.", "Do I see opportunities for further consolidation? I think there are still opportunities, especially on the second tier of companies, after these four or five companies we see opportunities for the consolidation. We expect now the merger of Boehringer Ingelheim and Merial being completed, there's another round of consolidation, and maybe in the future also we'll see some additional consolidation. Definitely the consolidation would be limited because of antitrust issues, but without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues, definitely consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry.", "The last comment I want to add is that the top 10 companies in animal health represent something like 80% of the total market. On the 20% which is remaining we have maybe hundreds of companies that in -where I expect that this will be a significant consolidation here. And Paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. I mean Jami asked a specific question. I think Jami was trying to get to where is our pricing power. For the full year, emphasis full year, our price added approximately \u2013 a little better than 2% overall but U.S. is about 2% and international was about 3%. Again, a lot of rounding here, but more price increases outside the U.S. than in. Next question, please.", "Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Doug Tsao with Barclays.", "Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe if you could provide a little bit more of an update in terms of how you will sort of increase the availability of APOQUEL, is this what we start now in terms of broadening the number of veterinarians who will have access to the product? Or is it going to be focused more on current \u2013 expanding to new patients? Also, if you can just provide some commentary in terms of the MFA business and how it's faring right now? One of your competitors spoke about some regulatory headwinds in that business and whether you're seeing those as well? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Doug. In terms of the increase for APOQUEL, so let me start saying that we have now two sources of the production of API and the second source that will be a company in Switzerland which is called Siegfried will double the capacity of the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. We plan to now offer APOQUEL to more veterinarians and also to offer more available product to existing veterinarians. At the same time, also the plan is to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product was put on hold because of product availability. So we are convinced that during 2016 we'll be able to meet all the demand from the market.", "In terms of MFAs, I think MFAs in our case continue growing very strongly and we have the advantage of \u2013 that's right this is the diversity of our portfolio. It's not only diversity in terms of therapeutic areas or in terms of different types of products, but also within the MFAs we have a lot of diversity. And for products that will be maybe facing some challenge because of changes on the approach of the use of antibiotics, and I mentioned in the medical important antibiotics in MFAs with indication of a growth promotion, this will be eliminated but in our portfolio we also have a non-medical important antibiotics in MFAs that can be a good replacement for those that will be eliminated. We have in total in MFAs $500 million in sales and we grew operationally in 2015 by 8%.", "So definitely we expect that those are probably the only indication of growth promotion which are medically important for human health that will have an impact in the revenues but this impact will be minimum. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.", "Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI", "Hey, Paul. My email went up during your prepared remarks. I just wanted to say that it was really a brutally awesome prepared remarks section, especially the part about how we should reverse the alphabet, I love that. That's a great idea. But in all seriousness, I had a bunch of questions, but I'll limit it to 1.5 because most people have been doing it. Number one, given all the opacity that \u2013 you guys have tried to do everything you can to make it clear but this the confusion, I guess, that FX potentially creates, why not synthetically hedge against the effects on that at least in that net income line especially after the turmoil this year, although you guys have done a great job helping us understand the effect.", "And then number two, maybe I missed this, but I didn't hear you break out APOQUEL sales on 4Q. I was wondering if you could. I apologize if I just missed it, if you could break those out in the U.S. and also the rest of world. And if you already answered that one, then my question would be the 6% to 8% normalized organic operational growth, what are the components of that for 2016 that you see? Thanks.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, I'll start with the FX. I think when you're looking at trying to hedge operations around the world against foreign currencies, you have two choices. You can either, in non-technical terms, let it fly, which is what we do with respect to operations like many, many other multinational companies do, or you can attempt to hedge. If you hedge, you hedge within a quarter, and the analysis that we've done has suggested that you're essentially chasing down. You limit the cost of the hedges, ultimately make it like a less than fruitful exercise. Now others will tell you that they can do it, and that's okay. That would be their point of view. I point out that a couple of the currencies that tend to be the most volatile, there are not markets for us to go out and hedge. I think they're not deep enough. They're not efficient enough. And so you wouldn't be able to fully offset that.", "I think I love your word there, opacity. I might have mispronounced that. We're trying our best to let the market follow along with as much of the information that we have that we can share with you so you can decide how we're performing. We do now, and we will continue to manage ourselves on an operational basis, meaning a constant currency basis. And I will hope against hope perhaps that at some point in the future here we'll see some more stability in the foreign exchange rates, and that we'll enjoy the positive upside, not from an operational perspective, but from a reported perspective of currency, FX rates going in the opposite direction.", "Juan, do you want to take the APOQUEL sales, or would you like me to?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The APOQUEL sales, I think we had more than $100 million in 2015. It's about $110 million. This was below initial expectations. And the only reason for that was that ensuring that we have enough product to supply to customers, and not increasing the number of customers having access until we have the certainty that the product would be available. Now we're having a situation that we increase significantly the production, and we'll be able to increase the deliveries to our customers. Globally in international markets, I think we had about $40 million, and then the rest was in the U.S. But it's important to understand that in international markets it was very limited number of countries where we have the product available in the market.", "You also asked about components of our organic growth, 6% to 8%, and Paul will provide the details of this.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, I'll start. First of all, we expect to continue to be able to take consistent price across our portfolio. That's a driver. Second is there's a significant impact from new products in 2016, which frankly will be an even bigger impact on 2017, and then just performance of our portfolio. When I say new products, I'm focusing on the ones that you can see that make a difference. I'd point out that we have lots of new products that we don't talk about necessarily individually and maybe individually don't move the needle, but in the aggregate they sure do. 6% to 8% normalized operational growth in revenue next year would be terrific, and then again going into 2017 new products help even more.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And, Mark, let me correct the total revenue that we generated internationally. Internationally was $20 million and then the rest was in the U.S. And I want to insist that in the international markets we have very limited number of markets and also limited supply. So the potential in both U.S. and international is much higher. So next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes, thanks very much. My questions are financial. Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground on the business and the outlook. So, Paul, two questions. First, could you please discuss the outlook for 2016 cash flow, including cash flow from operations and then planned uses of cash? And then second, if you could, just comment on the quarterly progression throughout the year, just to make sure that we set up our models appropriately and we understand the different variables to consider. Thanks very much.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, I'll start with the discussion around expected cash flow. Recall that we try to call them out each and every quarter. We have a large amount of expenses that we're incurring with respect to: one, the standup from Pfizer; second, the operational efficiency initiative; and now we add to the list a potential true-up of our international taxes in light of the EC's comments.", "If you look at our guidance tables, we call out the amount or the expected amount of the acquisition costs that we expect to incur in 2016 and then again in 2017. Those are I would call them \u2013 they're not normal and they will go away, and most of them will go away towards the latter part of 2016. But in 2016 it's a fairly significant call on our cash.", "Secondarily, we continue to be in a phase of investing in our supply chain. We continue to invest capital there, so our CapEx is tracking at a rate that exceeds our ongoing depreciation rate, so net-net we continue to invest there. Of course, we called out that we now have a program that everybody can do the math, where at least the current expectation is we're purchasing shares at the rate of $75 million a quarter. It's $300 million this year plus our dividend. You can do that math. And those are other than our earnings are the things that you need to take into consideration when thinking about our cash flow.", "I don't want to stop without speaking about efficiency of working capital. That is something that is to come. It's not something that you would see necessarily in 2015 and not in an enormous way in 2016. By the end of this quarter, we expect to have our ERP system up and running in all of our locations around the world, which is going to give us the ability to then implement tools, to much better manage primarily our investment in our inventories. Our receivables, I think we do a pretty good job there, and we certainly do the same things as everyone else with respect to payables. But we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in cost of working capital really until 2017.", "I wasn't specific there, David. I wasn't specific for the reason we don't want to provide specific guidance with respect to free cash flow, but I believe we've provided each of the components that will enable you to look out to 2016, 2017, and then beyond. I think when you get out into the latter part of this decade, our depreciation should start to normalize at a level close to our depreciation amount. I'll stop there.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You also asked about the quarterly progression for 2016. Let me provide a couple of comments here. So first we expect that the new product launches will have no impact in the first quarter and we expect that these products ramping up during the year. Also APOQUEL, we expect that the biggest impact we'll see from the second quarter of 2016 as we also extend the product availability in the markets where the product has been already introduced, and we also launch in new markets.", "In terms of expenses of course, also our efficiency program, will have much more impact in the second half than in the first half, because in the second half, we plan really to complete most of the actions that we took as part of the announcements that we made in May, and this also will have a positive impact in our results in the second half of the year. Next question please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company.", "Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you, good morning. Two questions, one first on PHARMAQ. When you acquired the company, you had stated that it was growing about 17%. Is that still a good estimate going forward, or could it be higher given their late stage pipeline that you talked about? And also do you continue to expect it to be neutral to EPS this year and then accretive thereafter, or could that accelerate?", "And the second question just has to do on trends outside of the U.S. in livestock. We saw the issue in France last year where they changed the legislation on antibiotics. Are there any other areas that we should look for in 2016 where there may be similar changes? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So Thank you, Kathy, for the questions. In PHARMAQ, what we communicated is that we plan to generate that revenue for $100 million in 2016 and $125 million in 2017 and at the end of the year PHARMAQ reported revenues of close to $80 million, so we see a significant increase in terms of our revenues.", "What we saw during the due diligence when we acquire in terms of the pipeline, it's performing now with the launch of the product in Chile that it was under this emergency license. And we will continue progressing in the plans that we have for PHARMAQ. So we are very excited about the opportunities of PHARMAQ. We are working also in terms of integrating the two companies, but ensuring that PHARMAQ remains a leader in aquatic health with enough identity to maximize the relationship with the customers that they already built through many years.", "In terms of the comments that you made, in France, definitely in 2015 we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in France. This was affecting antibiotics. We expect also that antibiotics will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets. This has been incorporated in our guidance for 2016 and 2017. And we also think that the projections that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what with our projections. So the industry will be growing about 5%. Antibiotics is expected to grow at half of this rate. The advantage for Zoetis is that it will have in our portfolio, antibiotics which are injectables, which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating and in some cases protecting also animals against infections.", "So we are confident that the impact that it will have in antibiotics will be lower in our revenue, but in any case all these elements have been incorporated in our projections. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Jeff, if you want to check your mute button please?", "Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Can you hear me now?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, we can.", "Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you. Good morning. I just want to ask a couple of questions around Sanofi and Boehringer. First off, if you expect that business combination or that potential business combination to have any impact on the competitive environment for you as you go forward into 2017 and beyond, any specific areas of concern or opportunity there? And then second, just as you got two European companies coming together there. You've talked very briefly in the past about potential inversions, lack of opportunities, that's potentially two less opportunities now. Just any updated thoughts there is that's really looking beyond you now to potentially look at any kind of inversions or spin-versions out there. Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jeff, for the question and definitely the Sanofi/BI merger will create a very strong competitor. It will be the second largest animal health company in our industry. But we don't think that the combination of the two companies will create additional competitive challenge to Zoetis. We have the scale, we have the diversity, and we have the business model that has been proven very successful in the past and will continue also being successful in the future. The productivity that we have in R&D is also showing very high levels. So we are confident that we'll continue growing in line, or faster than market. So we are projecting in fact in 2016 and 2017 we're growing faster than market despite of Sanofi/BI or despite of all these additional consolidations in our industry.", "Sanofi and BI, they are two European companies that potentially can be, maybe an opportunity for tax inversion, but also creating significant anti-trust issues to Zoetis. So we continue assessing opportunities that, to further consolidate, not with the only objective of saving on tax, but a combination of synergies that we can generate in terms of revenue, in terms of costs, opportunities on reducing our effective tax rate, and definitely creating a value to the company. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Next we'll go for a follow-up with Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.", "Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hey. I was just wondering if you could comment about the, I guess Juan Ram\u00f3n, did you say you guys have \u2013 supply of SIMPARICA is ready for launch?

Hosting the call today is John O'Connor, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.", "The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.", "At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation.", "In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.", "John O'Connor - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2016 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially for those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 4, 2016. We will also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating our steady and predictable growth, and confirming the strength of Zoetis as the industry leader in animal health.", "The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geographies, species and therapeutic areas, as well as our business model continues driving our performance. In previous years, we have seen different species leading our growth based on changes in market trends and the mix of products in our portfolio.", "For example, in 2013, our growth was driven largely by swine and poultry products. In 2014, it was driven by cattle and swine. And in 2015, companion animal and cattle led the way. This quarter, the most significant operational growth driver by far has been our portfolio of companion animal, a trend we expect to continue through 2016.", "Our companion animal business is growing, thanks to the increasing sales of APOQUEL, the addition of Abbott Animal Health products, the introduction of new vaccines in Europe and the U.S., and the overall positive performance of the rest of our portfolio. It is important as we experience softer growth in livestock.", "We continue to invest across our portfolio, and during the first quarter, our R&D investment continued to show many positive results, including the approval of SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide in the U.S., Brazil and Canada. This quarter also marked the completion of our ERP implementation. After nearly two years, all our commercial operations, manufacturing plants, and support functions are on a single platform, enabling us to achieve greater efficiency. Overall, we have been able to accelerate our operational efficiency program with a positive impact in 2016 and we expect to exceed the initial savings target of $300 million by 2017.", "I am pleased to say that with the positive momentum in the business and the help of improved foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our guidance for the two-year, 2016 and 2017.", "Coming now to more detail on our first quarter results. Operational revenue growth was 12% and you can find a slide on our webcast that break this down. These reflect six extra days in the quarter due to the accounting calendar, as well as the negative impact of changes in markets like Venezuela and India, and the product SKU rationalization that we communicated last year. Adjusting for these factors, the growth will be 10% operational and 6% excluding the additional impact of recent acquisitions.", "In the quarter, we grew adjusted net income by 28% operationally, once again growing faster than revenue and helped by the fact that our OpEx increased only 2% operationally compared to the 12% revenue growth. We continue to deliver our long term valuable position of growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.", "In looking at the overall market, we continue to see the animal health industry performing well, despite global economic challenges. We have seen good growth in most markets as greater consumption of proteins and increased medical spending on pets continues to help create customer demand for our products.", "As always, while I'm very pleased with the quarterly results, I also want to emphasize the need to look at our business on a full year basis to account for some of the seasonal situations and timing patterns in animal health.", "Let me now update you on our new product launches and R&D developments. APOQUEL is showing a steady growth. We have continued to launch APOQUEL in each of our markets such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and we plan in the coming months to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where it has been approved, including Japan, Brazil and Mexico. And this month, the product will be available to customers without restrictions.", "In the first quarter, APOQUEL sales were approximately $50 million, an increase of about $40 million from the year ago quarter. As previously communicated, we expect APOQUEL to generate peak sales of more than $300 million.", "As far as SIMPARICA, our new once monthly chewable tablet for the treatment of fleas and ticks, it was launched in the U.S. and in several European markets. It is early, but we are hearing a positive response from our customers and we expect performance to ramp up in the remainder of the year.", "We are also developing the combinations of the sarolaner molecule in SIMPARICA with other agents. This would cover a broader spectrum of parasites, including heartworm and we see sarolaner as a strong platform for future lifecycle innovations. Our canine antibody therapy that targets and neutralizes IL-31 to help treat atopic dermatitis in dogs has been introduced to veterinarian dermatologist in the U.S. under a conditional license. And we received another conditional license in Canada in the first quarter. We are hearing a very positive customer feedback and we are gaining market experience with the product.", "We continue to allocate our capital for investments in key commercial activities, R&D programs and business development opportunities that can generate faster revenue growth. For example, vaccines and genetics are two areas. We are expanding our portfolio as we put greater R&D emphasis around disease prevention. And in the first quarter, we had several positive developments.", "We received approval of RUI LAN WEN, the second vaccine resulting from our joint venture in China and the first combination vaccine in China to help protect pigs against a certain locally prevalent disease. We also gained approval in China for our poultry vaccine to help prevent Marek's disease.", "In the U.S., we have now received licenses from the USDA for a new VANGUARD B Oral vaccine and three new VANGUARD Rapid Resp Intranasal vaccines. Zoetis is now the first and only manufacturer to offer oral, intranasal and injectable options for vaccinating dogs against Bordetella bronchiseptica.", "We also granted a conditional license in the U.S. for an Avian Influenza Vaccine to help prevent diseases caused by the avian influenza virus H5N1. We are participating in a process to supply the USDA with this vaccine for the Stockpile should they decide a vaccination strategy is needed.", "We're also seeing progress in genetic tests, as our farm animal customers want more information about traits and conditions that can help them build a healthier and more productive herd. During the quarter, in the U.S., we launched CLARIFIDE Plus, the first commercially available genetic test that gives dairy producers a direct way to predict risk factors for costly diseases in hosting dairy cattle. And just last month in Chile, we launched the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon, the first attenuated live vaccine against SRS. This was a significant R&D achievement by PHARMAQ, and a much needed product to help Chilean fish farmers, great news for the industry and a terrific new opportunity for Zoetis.", "In summary, we are off to a good start for 2016, based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and the continued benefits of our R&D investment. We have been able to accelerate our efficiency program and expect to exceed initial savings target of $300 million by 2017. And finally, with improved foreign currency rates and the positive momentum of the business, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and 2017.", "With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. I'm going to hit on many of the themes covered by Juan Ram\u00f3n because they're important to the financial review of the quarter. So, let's talk about our first quarter performance. I'll walk you through a number of factors that you should consider to gauge how we did in Q1. There's some helpful information on the webcast slides and, of course, included in our press release. I'll then hit on a few other highlights in the quarter results and discuss our updates to guidance.", "Now, before I jump in the quarter, let me say that we know that the U.S. financial markets are quarter-centric and not to naucify quarterly modelers, but in any quarter, a lot of noise can and does creep into the comparison with the prior-year period. In our discussion and our webcast slides, our objective is to try to highlight for you the major elements of the noise in our results so that you can calibrate how our reported performance might influence your thoughts about our future prospects. The most important thing about our first quarter performance is that the results for Q1 supported an improvement to our outlook for the full year 2016.", "So, with that background, let me cover two important points that will enable me to put our 12% operational revenue growth in perspective. First, we operate on a 4-4-5 financial week calendar, with our International operations closing one month ahead of the U.S. Now, this is a carryover from our days as part of Pfizer. Under our 4-4-5 calendar, every handful of years you'll have a quarter in a year that has as many as six extra calendar days in it. That's what we have in Q1 2016 compared with Q1 of 2015. We estimate that the additional days account for approximately 6% of the 12% operational revenue growth for Q1 2016 versus 2015. Important safety tip for those with quarterly models out there, our fourth quarter this year will have five fewer days than the prior-year quarter and the full year 2016 has one more calendar day than 2015, this being a leap year. So, that's the extra days.", "Second, our operating efficiency initiative was a drag on our operational revenue growth in the quarter. We estimate that the combination of the eliminated SKUs and the changes to our business models in Venezuela, India and other countries reduced operational revenue growth by some 4%. So, think about it like this. 12% operational growth for the quarter, minus 6% for the extra days, plus 4% for the impact of the efficiency initiative, equates to a normalized growth rate of approximately 10%. Of that 10%, roughly 4% came from acquisitions including Abbott, PHARMAQ and other smaller transactions. So our organic operational growth in Q1 was circa 6%, and including acquisitions, was 10%. So, not 12%, but pretty good, right?", "Now, highlights for the first quarter, very high level. We've now entered what I previously referred to as the golden age of our companion animal business. With full supply of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA, a refreshed companion animal vaccine line, and the conditional license for IL-31, we are positioned to deliver significant growth in our companion animal business in 2016 and beyond.", "On a normalized basis, organic operational revenue growth, which adjusts for the six extra days, the impact of the operational efficiency initiative and M&A, we had about 20% growth in companion animal in Q1 compared with Q1 of 2015, and the growth was reasonably consistent between the U.S. and the International segments. On the same normalized constant currency basis, livestock was up 1% with solid performance in the International segment, offset by a decline in the U.S. Q1 of 2015 was a particularly strong quarter in U.S. livestock and there were a number of other factors that I'll touch on later. Our livestock business both in the U.S. and International segments are healthy and poised to contribute to revenue growth in the remainder of the year.", "Stepping down the P&L, our adjusted gross margin hit an all-time high of 67.4% in the quarter, a bit above the high end of our full year guidance range. But I'll point out that from a gross margin perspective, many things fell on the favorable side of the line during the quarter \u2013 mix, level of scrap, et cetera. Our expectations for gross margin for the full year continue to be in the range of 66% to 67%.", "In operating expenses, total adjusted OpEx grew 2% on an operational basis, but if you remember those extra six days, they impact our expenses as well. Our progress in reducing operating cost continues and we are on track to deliver on the promises of our operational efficiency in this initiative in 2016 and expect to enter 2017 having taking more than the targeted $300 million of costs out of our company.", "With our gross margin expansion and active efforts to contain operating costs, our 12% reported operational revenue growth translated into 37% operational growth in adjusted operating profit and 35% operational growth in adjusted income before tax. The EC's actions last January were a key driver of the 350 basis point rise in our adjusted effective tax rate to 30.9%, which resulted in our adjusted net income in the quarter rising 28% operationally.", "Our purchase of shares, which began in Q1 of 2015 \u2013 started in January 2015 \u2013 helped to reduce our fully diluted share count from 503.2 million in Q1 of 2015 to 499.5 million in the current quarter, and that led to operational growth of adjusted diluted EPS of 29%.", "So, that was a very quick walk down our P&L for the quarter. Here are a few more contextual details that I believe will help you think about our performance.", "First, FX. Dare I say that we may have found the bottom of the cycle? Maybe not, but the environment has improved for sure. Foreign exchange had a negative 700 basis point impact on our revenue growth in the first quarter compared with Q1 of 2015. That's a big hit. But based on current rates, the FX impact on our growth will lessen over the remainder of the year. While we continue to measure our performance on an operational or constant currency basis, it just feels better when the gap between operational and reported results narrows.", "Next, the SKU reduction and the changes to our business models in countries like Venezuela and India reduced our operational revenue growth by roughly 400 basis points. You should expect the growth drag on the full year to be roughly 500 basis points, so more of a negative factor compared with the prior year for the next nine months and particularly in Q2 and in Q3. Importantly, the impact of the SKU reduction and the changes in business models are felt more in our International segments than in the U.S. and more in livestock than in companion animal.", "Let me step through the elements of the 12% operational revenue growth in Q1. Price accounted for 3% of the growth, APOQUEL volume another 3%, 4% from acquisitions, 6% from growth of in-line products and minus 4% from the impact of the SKU reductions and changes to business models in Venezuela, India and other countries.", "Companion animal was the star of the quarter. Revenue growth normalized for both the six extra days and the impact of the efficiency initiatives increased 20% operationally. APOQUEL was the major driver, but other products contributed as well including vaccines as well as the Abbott acquisition. We also expanded U.S. customers' access to a number of our companion animal products to third-party distributors and that change led to a one-time in semi-permanent buildup of their inventories during the quarter to establish their base level.", "In livestock, we had lots of puts and takes. The normalized organic revenue growth was 1% operationally with the International segment up 5% and the U.S. segment down 9%. First, let's talk about International. The France livestock rebounded as the anti-infective sales in the quarter were higher when compared with a very light Q1 of 2015, which was caused by new legislation last year. Australia livestock also pushed the strong quarter with better weather playing a role. In Brazil, we benefited from above average price increases and continued favorable conditions in the cattle segment, which were in part offset by the negative impact or SKU reductions.", "In U.S. livestock, a mild winter was a major driver of lower cattle product sales in the quarter. With milder weather, there was a less risk of disease incidents and that impacted our premium products. We also saw decline in swine products due to increased competition.", "In summary, after adjusting for the noise, we had a solid quarter from a revenue perspective and through the ongoing programs to improve efficiency, delivered an improved gross margin, contained operating costs, and posted strong growth and profits.", "Switching to restructuring charges, let me quickly review this quarter's one-time charges related to certain significant items. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $12 million in the quarter, down about half from the prior year. That work continues to wind down and will be substantially completed later this year.", "In the second bucket, cost related to the efficiency initiative, we recorded $5 million of costs, which were more than offset by $33 million gain associated with the sale of four manufacturing sites in certain products as part of the efficiency initiative during the quarter. Interesting \u2013 rather than the gain, I like to think about it from a gross cash perspective. Gross pre-cash proceeds from the sale of the sites was $75 million. We have additional assets for sale including a transaction in Taiwan, which closed last Friday and any impacts from those sales would further affect cost in this second bucket.", "Finally, we recorded $3 million of cost associated with our ongoing supply network strategy initiative. We're still in the early days of that initiative. We also did record a one-time net tax charge of approximately $35 million in the quarter relating to the nullification of our Belgium tax ruling by the European Commission for periods from 2013 through 2015.", "Now, turning to guidance. There are four factors that lead us to narrow and raise our guidance for 2016. First, let me cover the easy one, FX rates. We refreshed our guidance for our current FX rates and that was certainly a help in our guidance. Second, in the first quarter, our International segment was stronger than we had expected and we're confident that strength will carry through the balance of 2016.", "Third, we are more confident in our expectations for APOQUEL as we put supply issues behind us and have launch plans in place in new markets and they're well underway. And fourth, we reduced our guidance for our 2016 effective tax rate on adjusted income by 100 basis points. This is due to changes in our projected mix of income by jurisdiction as a result of internal restructuring of our International operations.", "If you want to calibrate the various factors, at the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS, we raised guidance by approximately $0.10 a share, I'd be remiss if I didn't say it's actually $0.105, but it's $0.10 a share for this purpose. Roughly $0.03 comes from FX, roughly $0.04 comes from stronger operational performance and the reduced tax rate added roughly $0.03. I hope that helps you think about the change for the guidance. For 2017, the only change we made at this point are based on changed FX rates.", "So, to go through it for 2016 and 2017. For the full year 2016, we now expect revenue between $4.775 billion to $4.875 billion, reported diluted EPS of between a $1.41 and a $1.56 per share and adjusted diluted EPS of between $1.83 to a $1.90 per share. For the full year 2017, we now expect revenue between $5.075 billion to $5.275 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $2.01 to $2.19 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.24 and $2.38 per share.", "Now, to summarize, we enjoy a diverse product portfolio, global footprint and productive R&D that together enable us to balance fluctuations across different species, therapies and markets, and deliver consistent revenue and profit growth over time. We are well down the road of improving the efficiency of our operating expense structure, leading to improved margins and we're on track to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% in 2017. With the continued focus on expense efficiency, we expect to deliver operating profit growth faster than the revenue growth.", "Last but certainly not least, we strive to intelligently allocate our capital and actively manage our capital structure to drive shareholder returns.", "That's it from my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back to Juan Ram\u00f3n before we get to Q&A.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Paul. And before we begin the Q&A, I wanted to mention our personnel development. So beginning July 1, John O'Connor, will be promoted to the role of Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Business Analytics and Enterprise Risk Management for Zoetis; and Steve Frank will now lead our Investor Relations program; John will be reporting to Alejandro Bernal, Executive Vice President, President, and Group President of Corporate Strategy, Commercial and Business Development. John has done a great job as Head of Investor Relations over the last two years, and I wanted to thank him for those contributions. He will continue to be a valuable advisor to me, to Paul, and Alejandro in his new capacity. I am pleased to say that John will leave the Investor Relations program in good hands, and there is Steve Frank.", "Steve has a great knowledge of our industry and business, having worked in animal health for the last 15 years, and has been involved in our recent acquisition of PHARMAQ, Abbott as well as our IPO. Many of you know Steve, and he has been working with John in IR since 2014 to prepare for this opportunity. I'm sure we will have a seamless transition.", "With that, let me open the lines for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And we will take our first question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning folks and congratulations on the quarter, and congratulations, John, on the promotion. I'm not sure if I got the April cost sales. If you don't mind repeating what the April cost sales were by region? And could you also comment on some of the vaccines that you are developing on your livestock business, particularly the avian vaccine. Thank you very much. We'd appreciate it.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. So, the first question on APOQUEL. Total revenues for APOQUEL in the quarter were $50 million, and U.S. generated $35 million, and in International markets $15 million. These, I guess, it's answering your question on APOQUEL. You also ask about new vaccines. On new vaccines, we have new vaccines for companion animal, and this has been introduced in Europe as well as in the U.S. I mentioned new vaccines that are in the U.S. covering oral injectable intranasal, and I mentioned this for a specific Bordetella bronchiseptica disease. So, this is something that definitely represents a significant upgrade on our portfolio for companion animal infections.", "We also launched a new vaccine in China, used for swine, and it is combination of vaccine for PRRS with a combination for swine fever in pigs. So another opportunity for increasing our presence in China, and increasing our presence in the swine market in China. That is a significant opportunity for Zoetis.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So you guys talked about maybe exceeding your operational efficiency target of $300 million. I was wondering if you could give more color there on the potential upside, and then how this could positively impact your 2017 guidance and margin expectations? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we already incorporated in our guidance for 2017 the potential exceeding of the $300 million. At this point, we have not provided any concrete amount of this existing opportunity \u2013 is something that in the future. As we move into the programs, we'll be sharing that with you. Next set of question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go next to Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "A follow-up to that question on the restructuring, SKU rationalization and overall cost structure initiatives. How should we think about the quarterly progression throughout the year? And then as a second question, how would you characterize the current environment in the U.S. livestock business? You mentioned weather impacting the business in the quarter, but how should we think about the dynamics now? Thanks.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Erin, it's Paul. I'll take the how do you think about the OpEx roll out. As we said, we expect to enter 2017 with the cost structure trim down to its new inefficient level. We have some work to go on that and I think that if you're a quarterly modeler, I know you are, I think you got to think about it as continuing to show in positive impact through Q4. It's not like we're going to finish this in Q2, we're not going to finish in Q3, there is more to come that you will see evidenced in our cost structure in Q4. So, I don't know if that exactly answers it. But, yes, suffice to say that the improvements will continue to occur throughout 2016 and with a good chunk in Q4 2016. Do you want to take the last one?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Let me cover the question on the U.S. livestock. Let me start with the cattle. On the cattle, there are two segments, beef and dairy. Let's talk about beef. Beef, we reported that there were probably milder winter conditions that impacted our premium net products, but the fundamentals of the beef market of the cattle are very strong. We have seen that the increase in placement in feedlot. We also expect that it will continue for the rest of the year and also we expect that at the end of the year, the number of cows in beef will be increasing by 2% to 3%. So it's something that even if we have seen some temporary impact in the first quarter, we want also to see this business on a yearly basis and we're confident that on a yearly basis the market remain very strong.", "In dairy, what we have seen is the global prices for milk has been going down. This is also resulting in some negative impact in dairy customers. And in some of the cases, we expect that they will be reducing the number of dairy cows. Again, so it's a cycle that we have seen also in previous years. After a cycle of low price reduction of cows, it will be another cycle where prices will go up and then they will be rebuilding the herd. So, we don't see that this is something that is concerning on medium, long-term process for the business.", "In swine, we reported that we are facing some additional competition for vaccines. It's a similar case that we saw in the past with companion animal. We identified this need in companion animal. We have been working to upgrade our vaccines. Now our vaccines in companion animal are very strong and we are doing the same with swine. So, we are working to upgrade our swine portfolio for vaccines and we're confident that this also will bring us the opportunity for growing in the future. We don't expect the swine to be a significant driver of growth in 2016.", "And finally, poultry. Poultry in the U.S., I think it's a positive segment. We expect to generate the net positive growth in 2016. Next question, please.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy around dermatitis in dogs now that you've got IL-31 out there as well as APOQUEL? What are you learning about the market and how best are you using those two products? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, it's still very early because, first, APOQUEL has been \u2013 because of the limitations in terms of supply \u2013 has been mostly used in chronic dogs with dermatitis. We expect now that in May we are opening the market without restrictions. They will be expanding the market not only to chronic but also to acute.", "In the case of IL-31, IL-31 has been introduced as a conditional license. So what we are doing is to gain experience in the market by doing some activity with dermatologists, veterinarian dermatologists. This also has the objective of collecting all the data that will support full license in terms of efficacy of the product, but we are convinced that there are two products that they are very complementary and one is oral, the other one is injectable. There are some dogs which are not managing well swallowing pills. This is something that IL-31 will cover. There also, not everyone is responding the same way to treatment. So we see that APOQUEL, in some cases, is working very well; IL-31, in some of our cases, is also working very well. So the veterinarian will have the option to choose what is the best treatment there, depending on specific cases of dogs with atopic dermatitis or with any kind of skin conditions. Finally, APOQUEL will have broader indications, while IL-31 will have the indication of atopic dermatitis. Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much for the questions and congrats, John. First, just update on SIMPARICA and how you're thinking about the rollout of the product? I guess, should we think about a slower ramp here, given entrenched competition, and what type of share do you think Zoetis can ultimately capture of this obviously very large end market? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, as I mentioned, it's early, the introduction of SIMPARICA. SIMPARICA has been introduced in the U.S. and in a few European markets. We just plan to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product has been approved. SIMPARICA has been launched with very strong publications and comparing SIMPARICA against other products, oral and topical. And we have seen that SIMPARICA, it's showing very positive comparison in terms of faster action. So it's very fast on killing ticks and fleas and also very important. So, the SIMPARICA is keeping full efficacy during the duration of the treatment, which is also very important and much better than some of our competitors. So, we are definitely convinced that SIMPARICA will have a place in the market. I think we are not yet establishing what is the target in terms of market share, but definitely we expect that we'll gain the market share that corresponds to a company that our strength, the capabilities and our operations in the market.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it's Paul. I just want to follow-on on that. I think that the overall market size is for parasiticides is about $4 billion. The dogs' portion is about $2.5 billion; the fastest growing segment are the oral parasiticides. But if you want to think about the market, it's kind of in that $2.5 billion market and I think that we believe that there are two things. One, with our footprint and the quality of our salesforces we have the opportunity to certainly penetrate that $2.5 billion market and participate in the fastest growing part.", "The second thing I want to point out is, this is a self-developed product, and that means the economics of this product to us as compared with the economics of the product to Merial and to Merck that we're in license through third-parties. This is a very good product for us and we're really excited about both the prospects of penetrating their market, but also getting the fruits of our investment in R&D. So this is a great story and we'll see how it plays out.", "Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you, Paul.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So Elanco licensed a new canine osteoarthritis drug just in the last quarter. I wonder if you could talk about that in terms of why you didn't feel compelled to license that asset and just remind us what products do you have in that area and if you're very active in terms of R&D late-stage development there and how that might impact your franchise? Thanks very much.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, thank you for the question, Jeff, and we believe that we have a portfolio in pain, which is very strong. We have RIMADYL in all markets. We also have in the European market another product, which is also complementary to RIMADYL, which is called TROCOXIL and very important. So we have a lot of experience in this area, and this expertise is not only in terms of commercial, but also in terms of R&D. And in R&D, it's an area of focus and we have programs in pain that I'm convinced that will strengthen our portfolio in the future.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.", "Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI", "Hello. Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. It's actually Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. Congrats with the strong quarter and, John, congrats on promotion. So I have two somewhat related questions.", "First, more about macro trends in general. So your official guidance for 2016 and 2017 implies a strong operational growth in terms of revenue like mid to high single-digits. So I'm wondering if we can think about this revenue growth over the longer term that just will continue to grow in line with the rest of the industry \u2013 animal health industry or at some point, we need to expect some slowdown of this trend. And second, somewhat related question is about segments. Do you have more color about the potential long-term growth in different segments of products, antibiotics versus vaccines versus other pharmaceuticals and other segments that you report? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Vlad, and let me first describe what are the macro trends. So we see that the overall macro trend that maybe are is lowering down the growth in some markets. It's not affecting the same way to our industry. And one example, so we have seen that in Brazil, the GDP, it's declining, while the GDP for agriculture including their livestock is growing. So, again, so it's \u2013 in the animal health industry, I think we cannot extrapolate the macro trends which are affecting other sectors to our trends. And our trends are based on population, it's still continue growing; middle class, which is still increasing, and also they need to improve productivity because \u2013 well, the world is being challenged with the need of more food with fewer resources. And companies like us is that we can bring this type of innovation, we have a significant opportunity for our growth. And the same drivers are also impacting their companion animal. More people, more middle class is increasing the number of pet adoptions and also very important, the amount that pet owners are spending per pet in keeping these animals healthier and to live longer.", "So we are very confident that the macro trends remain positive for the animal health industry. And for Zoetis, we have been targeting to grow in line or faster than the market. In the first two years as independent company, we had been growing faster than the market. In 2016, because some one-time impact related to our operational efficiency, the reported growth will be lower. Adjusted by this factor, we expect that we'll be growing in line or faster than the market. The same for 2017. We have projected for 2017 a growth that, in my opinion, at the midpoint, is faster than the projection of the market and we have no reasons to believe that in the future we'll (sic) [we won't] continue growing in line or faster than the market.", "So one of the things that are very important is that we have already all what is needed to maximize our portfolio. And very important, our R&D investment continued delivering very strong results. And we have been continue bring into the market new products, but also very important bring into the market lifecycle innovation, which is also helping to protect our future growth.", "And maybe Paul can talk about trends in therapeutic areas, antibiotics, vaccines, pills that are part of our efforts to ensure that we have the right balance and the right opportunities for our growth.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Sure. And when you think about \u2013 when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, people look at our portfolio and they say, gee, you're a market leader in anti-infectives. I hear this and I see this in the news and therefore we have a lot of revenues at risk. And to put in perspective, I think what people mostly focus on the amount of anti-infective sales that we have in livestock. They're not necessarily as concerned with the anti-infectives that's used in the treatment of companion animals. We saw about $1.3 billion of anti-infectives in the livestock segment. But importantly, Vlad, first I'm going to talk about our company and our outlook.", "Included in that $1.3 billion, about $1 billion of that are in the form of high value injectable products that are dosed to animals when they are sick and where the alternative is that animal could die and the animals around that animal could die. And that's why we characterize as the responsible use of anti-infectives and that is the overwhelming majority of our portfolio was products that fall into that category. And while there continues to be pressure or concern from folks generally about the use of anti-infectives and wanting to use anti-infectives, what they are mainly focused on is not treatment of sick animals, but really the use of anti-infectives in ways that would, for example, to promote growth.", "Within our portfolio, about $300 million balance in livestock, that is mainly anti-infectives that are used in feed and in water. Our work with our customers and our own diligence strongly suggest that those products are being used in what we would call a \u2013 what we call a responsible way, in other words, not in sub-therapeutic doses to promote growth, but to treat sick animals. Even still, if I were looking as an outsider, I would look at that $300 million as \u2013 that's a piece I got to keep my eye on and that's a piece I'd be concerned about.", "Now, back to the overall trends. Our anti-infectives continue to grow, but they grow slower than the balance of our portfolio. And just so, well, real quick, of course, that's baked into our 2016 expectations, our 2017 expectations, and frankly is baked into our folks who look at our industry generally about what the long-term growth prospects are for the industry. It's an important part of the industry, and so that's baked into the macro view of our industry to able to grow mid single-digits or better for the foreseeable future.", "I'll continue on because it's a very interesting topic. We pivoted many years ago away from the development of additional anti-infectives to a focus on vaccines because the best way to reduce the use of anti-infectives is to reduce the incidences of disease. That's the best way. And we've been very successful of pivoting our R&D portfolio and now our product portfolio to feature vaccines and will assist producers in maintaining the health of their herd so that they would have to use less anti-infectives. So that's a big area for us. And we focused \u2013 I'm focusing all of this on the livestock segment because I think that's where your question lies. So I'll stop there. Next question, please?", "Operator", "We'll go next to Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just on the IL-31, what is your expectation in terms of timing for going from a conditional to a full approval and just obviously there's some limitations in terms of your promotion of the product right now. Just how widely is that being used in terms of veterinarians?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Doug for the question. So we expect but there is something that will depend on the final approval from the USDA. We expect this approval by the end of the year. So now what we are doing, it's a gaining experience and also collecting the data in terms of efficacy and this will be submitted to the USDA for final approval of the product and is related to the U.S. we have similar partner in Canada and a different one in Europe. Also, we expect in Europe this product approved in the future. So today it's used under this conditional license. So the use is quite limited because we're just going to fewer customers in the U.S. mostly veterinarian dermatologist, some other customers are using the product.", "Now the objective is not really to generate significant revenue growth but to gain experience of the product and making sure that the product it's generating the amount of data that would support full license. We're convinced that IL-31 will be an important product in our portfolio and very important so it's \u2013 Zoetis, it's developing a franchise which is this skin conditions, itching, atopic dermatitis. And with two products in the market I think it might have been that we have very strong position with it the future opportunities. Next question please.", "Operator", "We are going next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.", "Divya Harikesh - Goldman Sachs International", "Good morning. This is Divya Harikesh on behalf of Jami Rubin. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on capital allocation. Are there other assets that look more attractive at current valuation or areas that are of particular interest to you. Also how much leverage would you consider given the market's increasing concern on leverage levels for companies. Thank you.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "This is Paul. I'll take that on the capital allocation front. Of course, we continue to \u2013 I think like most companies and we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth that is always going to be very high return activity. So, first thing we do is try to max out programs inside that can drive revenue and that falls in the bunch of categories that's \u2013 yeah that could be incremental salesforce, it could be investment in DTC advertising to grow markets, it could be incremental investment in R&D to develop new products. It could be incremental CapEx to create a technology platform. So it's all those things. So we do that first.", "The second piece which is I think what you're asking about is outside. So we look outside on what sorts of opportunities do we see. We see a very consistent flow of what I'll call smaller deals that we do every single year that none of which I think on an individual basis is going to be exciting to the market at large, but in the aggregate help us one, feed our R&D effort because we can acquire technologies and things that feed R&D.", "Second is small add-ons that we just continually do and yeah that can be anywhere from $40 million to $75 million a year in activity and that's relatively consistent. The next bucket would be sort of the mid-sized M&A and I think last year and, I guess, I'd put PHARMAQ in that category and maybe even Abbott in that category as well.", "Lastly, we were fortunate enough to close two deals. I wish we could do that every year. The challenge is not our desire, would you do this deal. We will do those deals 100 out of 100 times if they present themselves. So we are \u2013 as I used to always love to say, we're tanned, rested and ready to do those deals when they present themselves and we're spring loaded to go after them when they present themselves but now predicting when they're going to be available is the challenge.", "On the larger scale M&A, really, I guess, what you think of it as potentially transformative, we've said many times over, our transaction with one of the top five companies is very difficult for reasons of anti-trust sort of \u2013 think of it as FTC type issues because there's a lot of concentration now amongst the top, say, five companies. So, the prospect for a transaction, I'd say, never say never; it's not zero, but it would be pretty hard. And then, next down the list, there are opportunities, there we continue to look. We are very active and I should say we're very proactive in targeting assets that we think would be interesting and valuable to add to our company, but of course, we're not going to disclose what our list of targets might be at any moment in time.", "And then, the last bucket is the one that I think is important \u2013 I referenced it in the tail end of my prepared remarks \u2013 and that is returning capital to shareholders. As we enter 2017, we have lots of the standup costs and the operational efficiency cost, and all those things behind us, not just from a P&L perspective, but also from paying out the accruals, et cetera, and we put that cash flow behind us, that negative cash flow behind us and we enter 2017, we still have to throw off a fair amount of cash.", "And the question is, well, gee, if you don't have anything to do with it, what are you going to do? Well, a couple of things. One, we have a dividend. It's a circa \u2013 a commitment this year of \u2013 call it circa $190 million or thereabouts in 2016. We have a share repurchase program. We are currently purchasing shares at the rate of 75 million a quarter under a program that we announced way back in November of 2014.", "And so, long-winded but, we intend to the extent that we can't deploy that capital in our business or outside our business, to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over time. We think that's appropriate. Cash is a non-productive asset for us to have around, but this also dovetails nicely into the discussion of capital structure, which you inquired about as well.", "So, we have articulated that we expect to operate in the normal course of business in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 times trailing EBITDA for a debt level for our company. Operating in that range will enable us to maintain an investment grade rating \u2013 we believe will enable us to maintain an investment-grade rating \u2013 and that's important, as you pointed out. I mean, the market is taking a different look at leverage levels today than they might have two or three years ago, and we're cognizant of that.", "I said \u2013 but because we get this question a lot, I'll restate it. People say would you ever do a deal that would cause you to be above that range? The answer is, yes. So, we would go above the top-end of that range to pursue what we felt was value-generative M&A. Would we go above that range to buy more stock? Probably not. In fact, I'll say definitely not. But we would in the context of making an acquisition.", "And so, we get below 2.5 times. We probably put some leverage on, we get above or up to the top-end of the range at 3.5, you'd expect us to manage that leverage down. The objective is to try to operate in that range and I'll stop there. I think as to the high-end of the range, I don't know what it is.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Next question please.", "Operator", "We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right. Thank you very much. So, I was a little bit on and off the call. I just have a couple of questions on the guidance changes. So for the 2016 guidance, Paul, what percentage of the EPS guidance increase was due to operations and what percentage was due to FX? And then for 2017, obviously, you haven't updated that guidance for operating performance; you've only updated it for FX. When do you expect to update it for operating performance? Could we expect that after the second quarter results or do we have to wait until the company goes through its full-year annual planning in the fall? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, David. It's Paul. I'll take that. I'll go through the \u2013 the factors in \u2013 the midpoint in the range $0.10 up, $0.03 from FX, $0.04 from stronger operational performance and then the tax rate was a $0.03 helper as well and that gets you to the $0.10 raise at the midpoint of our range in 2016. You're quite right. 2017, we said, we updated our 2017 guidance solely for the favorable change in FX rates. It's 2017 guidance. We're one quarter into 2016. We have a pretty broad range there. You can surmise that our outlook continues to be in that range or we would have adjusted \u2013 or adjusted that range. So there is no set time at which we would change our operational view of 2017, but to the extent that we were outside the range for 2017, we'd change it. I'll stop there. Next question, please?", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company.", "Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. First, I just had a follow-up on the sarolaner. Could you confirm that you do have full supply now so you're ready for full global launch? And was there any stocking in the first quarter of sarolaner?", "Second question has to just do on the SKU reduction, you've targeted 5,000 or roughly in total. Can you give us a sense of sort of where that's out right now and does that \u2013 is that something that just sort of goes away slowly as the year unfolds or is it more dramatic that they're kind of there until year-end? And also a sense of what therapeutic categories those SKU reductions are coming from. So as we sort of look at that, we can get sense of where some of those reductions will be coming. Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Let me start with sarolaner, SIMPARICA now. The name in the market is SIMPARICA and we have no restrictions for this product. We have enough of our product to introduce the product in all markets and where the regulatory authorities have approved. And this, in the U.S., all new markets and we also have operations for Canada and some other countries. So it's something that we don't see any restriction.", "So, at the time of the launch in the U.S. and also in Europe, there is no any significant loading of the product in the country. So, most of the product was related to samples that we provided to the veterinarians to get familiar with the product. So, we have not generated significant revenues in the first quarter, but we expect that these revenues would be ramping up during the rest of the year.", "So, we have very good expectations for the product. As I mentioned in some of the other comments, we have very strong publications supporting the efficacy of the product. As I said, this product is working very fast and also it's showing that during the duration of the treatment, it's having very strong efficacy. So, there is no drop in efficacy at the last day of the duration of the treatment, on the contrary is maintaining the efficacy.", "In terms of SKU, I think we have made significant progress on SKUs. So, most of the SKUs have been already eliminated from our portfolio, and maybe there are some few SKUs that will be eliminated from now until the third quarter, which are related to SKUs that will be replaced by other products that we are introducing in the market. But the large majority of SKUs has been already eliminated from our portfolio.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Let me continue on that because I think you asked the question about how it plays out over the course of 2016, and also important. We eliminate an SKU from the portfolio. If we sell it, like as we did, we sold some plants, as I said in my remarks, during the quarter and we sold it with the product. Obviously, the product is gone. We eliminate an SKU and we stop producing. We may still have inventory and we may still sell it. And so that's why you are seeing it play out over the course of 2016. But let me frame it.", "Q1, we said the impact of SKU reductions was about 4%, we said that we expected to be about 5% and this is growth versus prior year. For the full year, which it says that during the nine months, Q2, Q3, and Q4, it will be greater than 5% impact from a growth perspective versus the same period in the prior year. And I further said that it's mostly in Q2 and Q3. So the middle part of the year as we sell out these products and they are gone, and what you're going to see is a moderation of that in Q4 because we did start to see a impact in Q4 of last year. And as we enter 2017, there is still going to be a drag, because you still sold them at the beginning \u2013 some of these products at the beginning of 2016. But if you look at the kind of run rate when we enter Q1 of 2017, that will be fully reflective of all of those SKUs being gone, and again, impact versus prior year heavier in Q2, Q3 of this year, moderate in Q4, there is still an impact in Q1 next year, and Q2 next year, but it diminishes pretty substantially. The cool part is, we will have this activity behind us entering 2017. Next question, please?", "Operator", "And we do have a follow-up from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse.", "Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thanks so much. Also, I still don't see a balance sheet in the release. I guess my bigger question here is what can you accomplish in the way of working capital improvements near-term, and to address the high inventory days? And then also, how much was the distributor stocking contribution in the quarter? I assume that's related to the vaccine business. Was that material?", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it's Paul. Let me take the balance sheet and working capital questions. Yeah, we are working very hard to shrink and then eliminate the gap between when we report our earnings and when we release the balance sheet. We are expecting to file our Q Friday of this week. So, yeah, we've shrunk it to a couple of days. It had been substantially more than that. That's just a \u2013 we could not shrink those days in the context of also changing all of our ERP systems et cetera. So we are working on that and our goal is, to be like most other companies, to have our balance sheet on the same day to report earnings. So just know that that's a priority for us and we'll get there.", "With respect to working capital, you pointed out to the day sales of inventory that we are on at the end of the year. We expect that we can have some pretty sizable improvements in our investment and working capital efficiency. Now with the \u2013 thank some higher power of the completion of our SAP implementation where we have every part of our company up on one instance of SAP, we now have the opportunity to activate the tools that will enable us to much more tightly manage our investment and inventory while at the same time having a high service level to our customers. That's not something that is instantaneous, that is something that we explored it and I think I've said in public forums before, we expect to make progress against that in 2016. We'd expect to make much more substantive progress on that in 2017 and that is the focus of our opportunity in being more efficient in working capital.", "We're pretty good in accounts receivable. I'd say pretty good, we're good in accounts receivable and we are also good on accounts payable. So it's really inventory that we are focused on, expect a modest improvement in 2016 and more significant improvements beginning in 2017 as we get the tools up that will enable us to better manage our supply chain.", "Your question regarding the distributor stocking, again that was in the U.S. That was with respect to some companion animal products to increase. So the amount that went in was approximately $18 million in the quarter. And so, it's something that you should take into consideration. Next question, please?", "Operator", "And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Juan Ram\u00f3n for final comments.", "Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Great.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you very much for your attention.

Good morning, everyone. There's been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock, in particular, and the cycles we face as a part of the global food supply chain.", "Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with the positive result we have reported in the third quarter because it reaffirms that we understand the cycles of our customers' businesses. And as in the past, we continue to be resilient in our ability to adapt and steadily grow our business, despite the broader agricultural market changes.", "At Zoetis, we have regularly grown faster than the market, and we are very well positioned to achieve predictable growth during these cycles because of our diverse portfolio and global scope. We remain focused on the long-term full-year review of our business since quarterly results can be misleading about the cycles in our customers' markets. Our strength in all relevant geographies, species, and therapeutic areas help us offset many of the economic and business challenges that can affect part of the animal health industry in the near term.", "We're also making improvements in our cost structure and reallocating resources to the most important growth opportunities in animal health from a therapeutic area and geographical perspective. I'm pleased to say, we have nearly completed our operational efficiency initiative, and we can confirm that we expect to achieve the target of $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2017. We also now expect to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% in 2017, higher than our original projection, and we expect to grow our revenues faster than the market again in 2017.", "This quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew our revenue 4% operationally, with particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. When you exclude the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, foreign exchange, and acquisitions, or what we call normalized organic operational growth, our growth in the third quarter was 6%.", "On the same normalized basis, our companion animal products grew 11% and our livestock products grew 2%. The companion animal growth was driven by a full supply of APOQUEL and the introduction of other new products.", "And in livestock, the main driver of growth was strength in our international markets, which were able to offset the impact of product rationalization changes across the livestock portfolio. Moving forward, we expect companion animal to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2017. And in terms of livestock, we expect improved growth as we get beyond the product rationalization impacts this year.", "Moving on to earnings, we grew adjusted earnings 6% operationally, reflecting the negative impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate. Glenn will discuss this in more detail. But, excluding tax and interest, our EBIT growth was 17%.", "As we finish up 2016, we are increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance we have achieved through the first nine months of the year. And based on the monthly (sic) [continued] trends we see and the confidence in our business, we are also improving our guidance for 2017, despite the recent negative evolution of currencies compared to the U.S. dollar.", "Let me provide additional business updates on some key products and discuss the investments we are making to support that growth. For the first nine months of 2016, we have generated approximately $180 million in revenue for APOQUEL, with about $70 million coming in the third quarter. We have here an excellent response from veterinarians and pet owners using APOQUEL, as we increase our penetration in new markets. Our research indicates that we are achieving great awareness and satisfaction among veterinarians, as well as more frequent proactive requests from pet owners.", "APOQUEL has now been launched with unrestricted supply in all approved markets. And we are working on further expanding its market share. In the U.S., we have seen growth of new patients since achieving full supply in May. APOQUEL has been doing very well in treating dogs with chronic allergies. And we are increasingly seeing it used for more seasonal and acute allergy causes, an important part of our expansion plans.", "As we look ahead with APOQUEL, we are trying additional ways to support this product growth. For example, in the U.S., we are developing and testing direct-to-consumer, or DTC, advertising and we expect to launch a national advertising campaign for APOQUEL in 2017.", "Also to support the growth of our companion animal business, we have also been expanding our product portfolios and field force in China and Brazil. These are great examples on how our efficiency initiative is ultimately about better allocating resources to generate sales growth.", "Meanwhile, Simparica, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is available in the U.S. and most of the EU countries, and is being further deployed in markets like Canada and Brazil. In 2017, Simparica will be available for the full flea and tick season in the U.S. and EU. We are planning to support Simparica with additional promotional investment to ensure it has a positive impact in our revenue growth in 2017.", "We are also getting ready for the broader launch of our canine antibody therapy, targeting IL-31. This therapy is currently only available in the U.S. under conditional license. And in October, we expanded our efforts beyond dermatology specialists and made it available to all veterinarians in the U.S. We'll broaden distribution in the weeks ahead and we expect to achieve a full USDA license by the end of the year, with Europe to follow next year.", "We are also seeing good progress with the PHARMAQ acquisition that we made one year ago. We have posted $64 million in fish revenue through the first nine months of the year, despite the toxic algae bloom that has been impacting fish farmers in Chile. PHARMAQ has achieved rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for farmers in Chile. Fish farmers who needed a more predictable and reliable means of protection have responded very favorably to recent information that LiVac SRS has already demonstrated protection up to 11 months after vaccination, and we continue testing for longer duration of efficacy. Fish farmers also view this vaccine as an important way to reduce the use of antibiotics in their operations.", "Now, let me turn to the R&D innovations that continue supporting our future growth and value creation. New product introductions like APOQUEL, the IL-31 antibody therapy, Simparica and the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine are very important. And continuous innovation over the lifecycle of our products is also critical to our long-term success.", "In the third quarter, we had several approvals of new indications and formulations for key livestock products. In swine, we obtained approvals in the U.S. for new combinations of our FLUSURE XP vaccine. This now helps guard against additional flu strains that threaten swine herd health. We also expanded our FOSTERA swine vaccine with additional indications and approvals in markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Our premium injectable anti-infective DRAXXIN received additional indications and approvals in Japan and Canada. We also obtained approval in Japan for BOPRIVA, a unique vaccine that temporarily reduce testosterone in bulls, providing farmers with a highly-effective way to manage aggressive behavior.", "We're also making investment and showing progress in our diagnostic portfolio. In August, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices or SMB. They are pioneers in developing the manufacturing microfluidic lab on a chip diagnostic products, which are used for veterinary point-of-care services. SMB's promising product line has helped our existing diagnostic business, which obtained approval for values and test kits in the third quarter in new markets such as Mexico, Japan and Korea. Lots of good news to share about our new products, lifecycle innovation and business development activities.", "In summary, we have continued to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio across geographies and species. And this time, we see particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. We are realizing the benefits of a disciplined approach to R&D and business development, which is strengthening our business for the long term. And we expect to achieve our operational efficiency initiative target in 2017 and set ourselves on a path to increase profitability, cash generation and value creation, while maintaining our revenue growth.", "With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Before I get into the financials, I wanted to thank many of you for reaching out and speaking with me since I became CFO in August. I'm very excited to take on this role and work with the rest of Zoetis' leaders to continue driving the performance of our company. As CFO, I am committed to maintaining our reputation for financial integrity and transparency and continuing an ongoing dialogue with the investment community.", "We remain focused on achieving our updated financial guidance for 2016 and 2017, building our capacity for long-term revenue and earnings growth, and delivering the innovations and financial performance that people have come to expect from Zoetis.", "I am pleased to say that in my first quarter as CFO that we are making excellent progress on all those fronts, and we are raising our earnings guidance for 2016 and improving our earnings guidance for 2017, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, which was approximately $0.03. The consistent performance we've delivered over time through recent periods of major efficiency initiatives and change is a testament to the quality and commitment of our Zoetis colleagues.", "So, what are the key takeaways for the third quarter results? Continued strong operational revenue growth from our diverse portfolio, continued improvement in our adjusted EBIT growth and margin, a meaningful contribution from several new product launches, lifecycle innovations and targeted business development activities, and finally, an updated guidance for 2016 and 2017 that reflects our recent performance and confidence in the future.", "Now, let me walk you through the major pieces of our third quarter income statement and provide some color. We generally talk to operational growth, which excludes the impacts of foreign currency. You can also see, once again, in the tables on our website that we are providing additional detail on impacts related to our operational efficiency initiatives, M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. We refer to the revenue growth excluding these items as normalized organic operational growth. For the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 4%, which excludes the 2% negative impact of foreign exchange.", "Now, let me take you through the key elements of our performance and bridge that to our normalized growth. First, APOQUEL and a number of other new products contributed 5% of our revenue growth. The in-line portfolio grew 1%, with price contributing 2% and volume declining 1%. Recent M&A contributed 3% to our growth, while our operational efficiency initiative reduced our growth by 5%, due to product rationalizations and changes to our business in markets like Venezuela and India.", "Accounting for all of these factors, we delivered normalized organic operational growth of 6% in the quarter. And for the first nine months of the year, our revenue growth on this basis was 7%, in line with our view of 7% to 8% growth for the full year.", "Turning now to our segment performance; in terms of the U.S., we generated 1% operational growth compared to a very strong third quarter in the previous year. Just a reminder, the U.S. grew 19% in Q3 2015, with livestock growing 13% and companion animal growing 27%. In the third quarter of 2016, U.S. companion animal products grew 5%, driven by APOQUEL, Simparica and other new product launches like our new vaccines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in surgical fluid products.", "In U.S. livestock, we declined by 2% against the very strong year-ago quarter when we grew 13%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of SKU eliminations, lower sales of our swine products, where we continue to see increased competition, as well as the impact of a challenging market environment, especially for our cattle and swine customers. We partially offset this decline with growth in our cattle business, where successful promotional activity drove increased volumes. Shifting back to a normalized organic operational growth basis, U.S. grew 3% with companion animal growing 6% and livestock growing 1%.", "Turning to International, revenue grew 6% operationally. We delivered very strong operational growth of 15% in companion animal and 2% in livestock. Our International business saw a significant impact from our operational efficiency initiatives, which reduced growth by 8%. By species group, the impact was 9% in livestock and 6% in companion animal. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 5% to our International revenue growth. Based on these factors, our normalized organic operational growth for International was 9%, with companion animal growth of 21% and livestock growth of 4%.", "You can see the full results for our top 11 markets in the table, so let me highlight a few items. Growth in markets like Japan, Brazil, Germany and Australia was primarily from companion animal products and launches of APOQUEL. In Japan, we saw a significant benefit from the initial stocking of APOQUEL with wholesalers in the quarter. France and Canada both saw a mix of companion animal and livestock sales driving their growth, including sales of APOQUEL and a more stable environment in France around antibiotic usage and prior regulatory changes.", "Meanwhile, we continue to see livestock supported with growth in cattle in Brazil and swine in China, where we currently have favorable market conditions, as well as growth in companion animal in China, where we are seeing positive trends in medicalization rates for pets. Overall, we have been very pleased with the strong growth we have seen in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, where we have invested in expanding our field force and product portfolios to effectively capitalize on the fast-growing trends in these countries. We'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers, combined with high returns on our investments.", "Wrapping up the revenue picture, there are five key takeaways for the third quarter. Our diversified model continues to deliver steady, predictable and meaningful revenue growth, with strong product lines and geographies balancing the effect of certain market challenges and cycles.", "Product rationalization continues to impact revenue growth. However, we continue to deliver strong growth on a normalized basis. APOQUEL once again was a significant growth driver, with launches in new markets and continued expansion of the customer base in existing markets.", "Other companion animal products, like Simparica and recent additions to our vaccine portfolio, are contributing to growth. And finally, when it comes to revenue, we are improving the base business in various emerging markets by expanding our product portfolio and adding to our direct sales capability.", "Turning to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to a more profitable mix of products, while foreign exchange had a negative impact of 70 basis points this quarter. Adjusted operating expense also declined, reflecting the continued realization of our operational efficiency changes and continued discipline around SG&A, which includes the addition of PHARMAQ expenses this year.", "Improved gross margin and a reduction in operating expenses enabled us to grow our adjusted EBIT by 17% operationally, versus the 4% operational revenue growth.", "Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.6% versus 25.1% in the year-ago quarter. This difference was primarily driven by the impact of the European Commission tax ruling earlier this year, and the benefit of certain discrete items in the year-ago quarter.", "As a result, adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, reflecting the change to our adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense, which offset much of our adjusted EBIT growth. For the quarter, GAAP net income grew 26% on a reported basis, aided by a reduction in stand-up costs and restructuring charges, as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the establishment of our new International operating model.", "Moving to guidance for full-year 2016, we are narrowing to the high end of our revenue range, and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to reflect our ongoing confidence in the momentum of our new products and the sustainable cost benefits of our operational efficiency initiative.", "As you model out the remainder of 2016, remember that we have five fewer days in Q4 2016 than Q4 2015. And this is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue, and our lowest quarter for gross margin, due to the seasonal nature of our product mix.", "For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth, including the impact from product rationalization, of 4% to 5%, and adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 32%, and operational growth and adjusted net income of 12% to 15%.", "The significant increase in our guidance for reported diluted EPS is due to our increased outlook for the business and the favorable tax items realized in Q3.", "Moving to 2017; since our last update in August, changes in FX rates have lowered our views for revenue by $50 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. However, the overall evolution in our business over the past year has been positive on balance, as our companion animal dermatology portfolio continues to grow and several livestock markets in our International business are strengthening.", "These changes are allowing us to increase the lower end of our revenue range and maintaining the high end, while absorbing the negative impact of foreign exchange. Cost of goods remains the same at 32% to 33% as we have been successful in our cost reduction efforts, as well as our SKU rationalization that has brought an improved mix.", "On SG&A, FX changes were slightly in our favor. However, we are increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end as we allocate a portion of our cost savings to promising investment opportunities, such as, advertising and promotion investments in key companion animal franchises like APOQUEL and Simparica that will drive revenue starting in 2017 and over the next several years.", "Field force expansions in Brazil and China where we see sustainable growth drivers and opportunities for increased market share, and enhancements to our diagnostics commercial capabilities following the acquisition of SMB. We're also taking on the necessary R&D investments to develop SMB's pipeline, as well as investing additional R&D dollars to some of our key international growth markets. When you take all of these changes together, we are increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range, maintaining the high end of $2.38, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, while also improving our view for adjusted EBIT margin to be between 34% and 35%.", "While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we are currently expecting the delivery of full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year for a few reasons. First, we will have some lingering effects from the operational efficiency initiative in the first two quarters as we continue to sell out remaining inventory in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. Second, a portion of our revenue growth is dependent upon the ramping up of new product launches, which we expect to build throughout the year. Finally, many of the incremental investments we are making on the SG&A line are weighted towards the first half of the year and begin to deliver results on the revenue line as the year goes on.", "A final point on capital allocation; we are continuing to repurchase shares at a steady rate of $75 million per quarter. At this rate, we'd exhaust our current plan at the end of this year. Share repurchases will continue to be an important element of our capital allocation framework and we will provide a more specific update later this year.", "So wrapping up; we've improved our outlook for revenue. We've achieved our targeted cost structure. We're prudently taking on investments in long-term growth. We've improved our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin and we've improved our view for EPS. There's been a tremendous effort to get where we are. We're proud of what we've achieved to-date and we are excited to continue to move the business to new heights.", "With that, I'll hand it over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And we'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question here is on livestock. How should we think about Zoetis' ability to grow livestock sales through pricing pressures in the U.S. for cattle? And can you provide more details on the herd size, U.S. feed lot sales, and producer profitability and the puts and takes here? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Louise. It's Juan Ram\u00f3n. Well, on the question on the livestock and how we plan to grow this business in price or other volume growth, definitely, we'll continue applying the same strategy in terms of pricing that can be justified through outcome and providing the value to our customers. We continue having these prices vary constantly over the years, and we also plan to continue increasing these prices in the future.", "In the U.S., as we reported, livestock in this quarter grew by 1% in terms of normalized growth, so excluding the impact of SKU or currency or M&A. If we go to the sales of \u2013 in light of this growth, cattle grew by low-single digit, swine declined and poultry have double-digit growth.", "So, talking about the cattle and also the situation on the feed lots and all different drivers that are affecting this segment, so let me describe the factors that are impacting the cattle business in the U.S. So, one, it's more animals, which is positive. We have seen also in this quarter higher placement of animals in feed lots, another positive element. But there are other elements, which are negative and we have seen that in the quarter.", "So, first, the producers are losing money. Animals are entering heavier into the feed lots. And also, we have experiencing mild weather conditions in the U.S. that are driving a lower-disease incident. So, net-net, compared to one year ago, we think that the situation is less positive. But still, with this situation, we have been able to grow the business and the reason why we are growing is because of our portfolio, the ability also to increase prices and also the team, which is interacting with customers.", "The last comment I want to make here is that this is a business, livestock, which is affected by cycles. Cycles that have been affecting in the past, and will continue affecting in the future. Despite these cycles, the animal health industry has been very resilient and they're showing very steady growth. In the past, that's 5% to 6% and we expect also in the future despite of those cycles we will continue growing at the same rate. And definitely, we see Zoetis also growing in 2017 in livestock in line with the market.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll take our next question with Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. And maybe I'll just try to ask both questions upfront, so the first one on APOQUEL. I think it's now $280 million run rate before the DTC. So, how do you feel about that north of $300 million goal? Is that now possibly $400 million? And maybe if you can talk about what prior DTCs have done to other Zoetis products, like Rimadyl.", "And then just a follow-up on the U.S. livestock; you mentioned you're up 1% after the adjustments in the SKU rationalization. In the comments, I think you called out some promotions in the quarter. So just wondering, is the thought of positive U.S. livestock growth for the year still intact? Just trying to get the fluctuations between 3Q and 4Q. Thanks, guys.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Jon for the question. On APOQUEL, we expect definitely to exceed that $300 million. We want to make sure that we have full understanding of the market reaction not only in the U.S., but also in all the rest of the markets in the product has been now made available that \u2013 with full availability. We also need to have a full understanding of what will be the impact not only in chronic, but also in seasonal and acute. And we said that DTC campaign, definitely, we expect to broaden the access of \u2013 or expanding the access of the product to more patients and also bring pet owners to the clinics then the veterinarians then can prescribe the product.", "In terms of other DTC investments, we mentioned also that we are considering also DTC for Simparica. It's something that we will consider in the U.S. when we have the right level of penetration in the market.", "In terms of cattle; so cattle in the U.S., we expect that at the end of the year, we'll be growing and we insisted many times that it's important not to look at our business on a quarterly basis, but on a full-year basis. And in full-year basis, we still expect the cattle business showing positive growth. And we know that some cycles that can be negative at certain point will turn into positive in the following phases or the following quarters or months. So, we are confident also that the cattle business in the U.S. will be showing growth in 2017.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "And this is Glenn. And just to add on to APOQUEL in terms of the DTC. Since we don't have a lot of experience with DTC with a lot of our other products, we did run specific pilots for APOQUEL that give us strong confidence in the return that we're going to get that investment in the future.", "And then the other thing in terms of the peak sale, we really do want to stress to look at that from a dermatology portfolio perspective. We're very excited about IL-31 in the future that that's going to bring for us.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks very much for taking my question. Just for Glenn, I wonder if you can just tell us around some of the inventory management you have. You have the SKU focus. You quite clearly guided for that in 2017. Could you just tell us if there could be further inventory movements from the integration of SAP and is that included in the 2017 guide?", "And then just quick add-on of you noticed \u2013 you mentioned an update on the share repurchase, would that be part of our Capital Markets Day later this year? Thank you.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "So from an inventory perspective, we definitely still do see significant opportunity to reduce our inventory moving forward. We currently sit at 10 plus months of inventory on the balance sheet and that's definitely an area of opportunity that we see. And we'll start to see benefits from the additional visibility we have in SAP. We'll start to see those benefits in 2017 and beyond, so definitely an area of opportunity for us to increase our cash generation.", "The other question in terms of share repurchase, so we have a $500 million share repurchase program in place that started last year. We'll be complete with that program by the end of the year, and we'll come back to the market later in the year with our intentions for that moving forward. But share repurchase does remain a very important part of our capital allocation priorities.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Could you talk a little bit about the swine business, and how much of a headwind has that been to organic revenue growth the last year or so? And I guess, when can we think about new product timing and concentrations of that? I mean just talk a little bit more about how you are thinking about rebuilding that business, or expanding that business.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Yes. And let me describe the swine business, not only in the U.S., but also International. Internationally, the swine business has been showing double-digit growth, which is very strong growth. While in the U.S., we saw in this quarter, a decline. The main reason of this decline was some challenge in terms of one important vaccine that is used in the swine industry, which is the PCV2 vaccine. We expect to update this vaccine, and having a positive impact in terms of growth in 2017. The rest of the markets outside of the U.S., the performance has been very strong, especially in China, where we continue seeing the benefits of more sophistication of the swine production (39:16). And we are very well positioned to maximize the opportunities in this (39:21) market. We also \u2013 after we explain that, we are expanding our portfolio and field force in the country, in China. And definitely, we see swine generating net growth in 2017.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Scotti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Scotti - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask on operating margin, because given the increase in 2017 guidance; Glenn, in your new seat, would appreciate any thoughts on where you see operating margin growth beyond 35%? And specifically, where do you think the upper bound of operating margin expansion is? Is above 40% realistic here?", "And then also, can you comment specifically on the contribution of the manufacturing initiative in future years? And then really fast, sorry, just a follow-up on APOQUEL. You mentioned you plan to exceed $300 million, can you provide any detail on timelines for that? Is that a 2017 event? Thank you.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "So, in terms of the $300 million, I'll take that question first, that is a 2017 event. Exceeding the $300 million is baked in to our projection for 2017. In terms of operating margin, so we're not targeting a specific operating margin going forward. We're really focused on income generation and cash generation, and that is our focus. However, when you look at what we articulate as our long-term strategy, the ability to grow revenue at a faster pace than our costs, that definitely does lead to increased margins as we move forward.", "And in terms of the benefit that we expect to get from the supply network strategy moving forward, so we have articulated and we're still committed to, by 2020, we do expect to achieve an extra 200 basis points improvement in our margin from that strategy. So, when you take all of those factors together, that definitely leads to improved margin. But again, our focus is on cash generation.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Good morning. This is Jonathan (41:21) on the call for Jami. So, if protein prices continue to fall and are sustained at lower levels as a result of your cyclical factors, would that potentially cause you to revise your expectations, particularly in cattle and swine?", "And a second question, some of your competitors have cited challenges in their dairy segment, and given that you discuss cattle as a consolidated figure, I was hoping that you could comment on trends seen in that particular group?", "And further, can you elaborate on the progress of the SKU rationalization program and when that will begin tapering off, and whether you will see operational growth in U.S. livestock remain positive, net of these rationalizations? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you for your questions. Hi, Jonathan (42:02). Let me start with the comment on the protein pricing and how this can be affecting our business. So, we have seen that these prices are going up and down, it is part of cycles that has been affecting our industry for decades. And we have been managing that very well, this situation. We saw prices going down for poultry, and then the next cycle, going up. It always depend on the supply. The demand continue growing, and it is something that will help the industry to continue generating more revenues.", "We don't think that the current situation is specifically negative. It's something that we expect that there will be a reverse in the near future. And we will see that this is not having a negative impact in our projections. And, again, so this industry (43:11) has been very predictable and showing steady growth, even in situations with significant negative factors, including the drought or even including the economic crisis in 2008, the animal health industry was probably one of the few industries showing growth in this negative environment.", "Dairy, we have seen that the prices of dairy has been down significantly at the beginning of the year. Now these prices are recovering, and very important is that we have not seen any reduction of a herd in terms of cows, which is an indication that producers are still keeping the animals to ensure that they will be able to supply market demands in the next cycle. So, we expect also dairy having a positive trend in 2017.", "And then, Glenn will talk about the SKU rationalization.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "In terms of the SKU rationalization, we are essentially complete with that program. However, we did have some sales of these products in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. That does pose a challenge in the comparative for 2017. We estimate that impact to be about 1% for 2017 and more disproportionately weighted to the first half of the year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much. Glenn, can you expand a bit more on the supply chain optimization plan? You've talked in the past about a couple hundred basis points goal, but could you maybe just lay out a little more specifically, the timeline and the strategy to get there? And then secondly can you give us an update on how the livestock antibiotic portfolio did in the quarter? Thanks.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "So, in terms of the supply chain optimization, there are a number of sites that we're still in the process of divesting or changing our strategy in three sites essentially that will need to ship product from one site to another. That occurs over time. So the progression of that 200 basis points improvement that we talked about through 2020 will come over a number of years. You'll see that in 2018, 2019, and 2020. It won't be an automatic shift. It's based on the timing of shifting the products of the \u2013 from those three plants.", "In terms of livestock antibiotic growth year-to-date, we are seeing positive growth year-to-date in those products. There are some shifts with M&A \u2013 within MFA. But overall, our antibiotics are growing year-to-date.", "Operator", "And we'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Frank DiLorenzo - BMO Capital Markets", "Good morning. This is Frank DiLorenzo on behalf of Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Regarding business development, will management continue to look towards small opportunities such as the recent Scandinavian Micro Biodevices deal, or are you willing to consider larger deals. Also along those lines, are there any particular areas of interest that you are focusing on? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "So, we are not limiting our target in terms of M&A to small acquisitions. What we are targeting is a business that will support our strategy and also will create value. And I think we have significant experience in integrating companies. We think that any acquisition that is supported by the strategy and the value creation will generate synergies in terms of costs and also revenues. We are also defining what are the areas of interest for M&A. We will continue assessing opportunities in our core business. But also, we will consider in diagnostics also in genetics, and in devices, as a way to complement our portfolio and maximize the already existing infrastructure that we have that we will be using these products also to deliver even higher value to our customers.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you, good morning. Two questions, first on APOQUEL, I think you've talked in the past that the APOQUEL sales have been largely three-quarters U.S. and one quarter O-U.S. How has that shifted and how do you see that trending going forward? And also on APOQUEL, are you able to tell us how many dogs in the U.S. have been treated with APOQUEL so far?", "And then secondly just a broader question on pricing trends, as you look into 2017, can you remind us what you're pricing expectations are, both U.S. and O-U.S. and whether there's been any change from 2016? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Let me start with the comment on prices. So, on prices, we are consistent also with the animal health projections. And the animal health projections is growing prices 2% to 3%. And this has been always very consistent in the past, and we'll continue applying this 2% to 3% in our projections. And we expect that 2017 also will be in line with these percentages. Not too big difference in terms of U.S. or international. The only difference in some international markets with high inflation rates, the price increases can be higher and in line with this inflation.", "You also asked about the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. mainly. And well, so far, until very recently, the use of APOQUEL has been mostly focused on chronic. We have seen already in this quarter that it's already APOQUEL in the U.S., which is where we have more recent market research. The use has been also extended to seasonal and chronic and acute. And we expect also this to continue not only in the U.S., but also in the international markets. And we are very confident that the expansion of the products will be driven by the use in all the different categories; chronic, acute and seasonal.", "You also asked about what is the division of APOQUEL U.S.-international. Well, this quarter, on the $70 million, $40 million came from the U.S. and $30 million international. This is something that is probably not representative of the full potential of international and the U.S.", "What we can also show in the market through market research is that the new patients is growing constantly in the U.S., which is very positive, and we expect that this will continue. And if the results of the pilot is showing positive for the DTC that we are testing in the U.S., then we expect that this will be also accelerating the use of APOQUEL in the U.S.", "As you know, not in all markets that DTC is available because there are some restrictions in terms of regulatory for direct-to-consumer advertising in many markets in the world.", "Operator", "And we'll take a follow-up from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. Thanks. This is Mike (51:10) on for Derik just with a quick follow up. In the last couple of months there's been a lot of movements in the competitive landscape with companies moving ahead with proposed asset swaps, some divestitures. Can you talk a little bit about how have you seen any change in the competitive landscape, if you've been able to gain any share, and especially in the last quarter there was a lot of mixed results from competitors, particularly in companion animal in the U.S. Some promotional changes with flea and tick; can you just talk about if you've been able to capitalize on any of those disruptions in the market?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Well, let me start saying that we believe that we have the best portfolio in animal health industry in both companion animal and livestock. We have significant new products launch recently, and also very important our R&D investment in our current portfolio is also showing very positive results. So, we don't think that the consolidation of the industry that will be taking place from now until the end of the year will change that significantly the competitive landscape. We compete not on a global basis, but also on a country basis and also on species basis.", "And there are not too significant difference because of this consolidation. So, we are very confident that we remain very competitive, and the products that we are introducing and also this report in terms of promotional activities and R&D and even manufacturing quality and delay of supply will help us to maintain and expand our market share.", "Operator", "And it does appear we have no further questions at this time. I will return the floor to you, Juan Ram\u00f3n for any additional or closing remarks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "So, thank you very much for joining us today. And as we said, we reported very strong results in the quarter. We are very confident on the projections that we are making for 2016 and 2017. And we'll connect again in the next earnings release. So, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And this will conclude today's teleconference. A replay of today's call will be available in two hours by dialing 800-839-1320 for U.S. listeners and 402-220-0488 for international.

LLC", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Operator", "Welcome to the second quarter 2017 financial results conference call and webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.", "The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in, or on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com.", "At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.", "Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Zoetis' second quarter 2017 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.", "Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, August 8, 2017. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. As in previous quarters, the innovation we bring to the market and the diversity of our portfolio across the geographies, the species, and the therapeutic areas are all supporting in the consistency of our financial results. Our innovations include the recent introduction of new products like Cytopoint, Simparica, and Stronghold Plus, and lifecycle innovations that are developed across our approximately 300 product lines.", "Our diverse portfolio helps us overcome economic cycles and deal with all the political situations and weather conditions that affect the markets, the species, or the product categories. We are seeing this diversity once again in the second quarter. And along with the excellent execution of our Zoetis team and our singular focus on animal health, all these factors helped deliver excellent results.", "In the second quarter, our revenue grew 6% operationally, and excluding the impact of product rationalizations that we have discussed before, our operational growth would have been 7%. We expect this will be the last quarter that we see any significant impact from the product rationalization, as those efforts and comparisons are largely complete. The main driver of our second quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew 10% operationally, driven largely by sales of our industry-leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint and our new oral parasiticide, Simparica.", "In the U.S., companion animal products grew 7%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to see further penetration of new products in key countries outside of the U.S. such as Japan, Brazil, and Canada. We have been supporting growth for Simparica and Apoquel with direct-to-consumer advertising that we have started in the second quarter in the U.S. We have made similar efforts in Brazil. Initial reports on DTC in the U.S. are positive, and we look forward to analyzing more data as we evaluate the full-year impact.", "Our total dermatology portfolio has shown significant growth, achieving our first-ever quarter of more than $100 million in sales. We continue to build disease awareness through our DTC campaign and expect to expand the market. Our latest data shows that 55% of dogs with dermatology problems in the U.S. are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 52% in the first quarter.", "Cytopoint has gotten good traction in the U.S. this year. And in EU countries we are conducting an early experience program and expect to fully launch in September. We believe the early adoption and stable reaction in the U.S. is a good indication of the success we can achieve in the European markets. Although Simparica sales were lower than in the first quarter, we continue to track well with our expectation for the year in this highly competitive market. In the U.S., we have seen net sales from clinics to pet owners growing market share since the beginning of the year.", "Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 3% operationally, with increases in cattle and poultry products being partially offset by a decline in fish products. Our swine product sales in the quarter were flat. In the cattle market, we posted 4% operational growth. Export demand for U.S. beef has been increasing due the lower average retail prices. And we continue to see positive signs in other major beef-producing markets, like Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Australia, and Canada.", "In the case of poultry products, we grew 4% operationally. We are seeing strong growth in the U.S., driven mostly for our broad portfolio and expertise to help customers address a range of consumer and retailer preferences. Combining our vaccines with product such as Zoamix, Robenz, and Deccox, we are helping certain producers shift to No Antibiotics Ever production.", "In swine products, although we have taken actions to strengthen our vaccine portfolio in the U.S., we are still showing a decline in U.S. sales. In international, however, our swine business is growing very strongly, led by China, the world's largest pork market.", "In fish products in the second quarter, we have seen a decline of 5% operationally, mainly due to a slower uptake of our SRS vaccine in Chile. Nevertheless, we still expect double-digit growth for fish products this year, and we remain confident in the long-term prospects for this business.", "We posted 11% operational growth in adjusted net income, once again faster than revenue growth of 6% and in line with our value proposition to shareholders to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. And the full implementation of our efficiency initiative is enabling us to invest in additional promotional activities like DTC, while showing only a modest 1% operational growth in operating expenses.", "With our increasing cash flow, we continue to look at other investments we can make to support our future growth. One key area is ensuring reliable, high-quality supply to drive our growth. As part of our supply network strategy, we expect to complete the sales of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we are planning to expand our vaccine plant and invest in manufacturing capacity for other innovative products. We'll share more details as plans move farther along.", "While new products like Simparica and Cytopoint may get well-deserved headlines, we also focus on lifecycle innovation to keep established brands delivering value to customers over decades. For example, Zoetis received approval in May from the FDA for Clavamox Chewable for dogs. This leading anti-infective was first approved in the U.S. in 1984, and it provides a broad spectrum of treatment for various infections in dogs and cats. Clavamox Chewables join the original tablet and liquid drop formulations, which we'll continue to market.", "And our internal innovation is complemented by M&A opportunities. Last week, we completed the acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma, an innovator in monoclonal antibody therapies for companion animals in management of chronic pain and other therapeutic area. This acquisition demonstrates how we use external innovation in key technologies and therapeutic areas to support future growth. Nexvet strengthens our R&D pipeline in monoclonal antibodies to help us to sustain our leadership in chronic pain management for companion animals, an area valued at an estimated $400 million a year, and which is poised for innovation with new monoclonal antibody therapies. We are moving ahead with the work of integrating Nexvet into our existing research and manufacturing operations in order to advance with their promising product candidates.", "With the first half of the year now behind us, we are tracking to our expectations. We are pleased with the strong start to the year, and we are increasing our full-year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income, based on foreign currency changes and our continued confidence. With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results and full-year guidance. Glenn?", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning, everyone. We had another solid quarter based on the strong growth of our dermatology portfolio and other recently launched companion animal products, as well as growth in our global livestock portfolio, which was balanced across our U.S. and international business segments.", "Total company revenue grew 6% operationally, which excludes the negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Breaking down that 6% growth, 6% came from dermatology and other new products, and 1% came from our inline portfolio, with the product rationalization having a negative 1% impact on operational growth.", "As Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned, our dermatology portfolio reached a considerable milestone with sales in the quarter of $102 million. As we have said in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S., with a softer Q1 and Q4. As expected, Simparica sales were lower sequentially at $20 million. This was driven primarily by the U.S. and the timing of distributor purchases in Q1, in anticipation of the flea and tick season. Internationally, we saw strong growth sequentially in Simparica, with additional penetration in most major markets.", "In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 11% operational growth in adjusted net income, and 12% operational growth in adjusted diluted EPS. Overall, we had another quarter of solid top line performance, and we again grew our bottom line faster than our sales. We continue to deliver steady, long-term growth in an attractive and stable industry. Our ability to bring innovative and differentiated products to market, combined with our diverse portfolio and leading commercial capabilities, gives us a stable foundation for future long-term growth.", "Now let's discuss segment revenues. Our International segment generated operational revenue growth of 7%, while the U.S. grew 5%. In the International segment, product rationalization had a negative 1% impact on growth. So let me highlight a few markets.", "China has delivered another strong quarter, growing 14% operationally, with growth coming from both our livestock and companion animal businesses. In livestock in China, we benefited from solid market dynamics in swine, including favorable pork prices through the first half of the year. We expect some softening in this trend during the second half of the year. However, the continued modernization of production will drive greater long-term growth based on the use of vaccines and medicines to ensure a safe, high-quality food supply. In companion animal, our recently expanded field force continues to partner with local veterinarians to improve medicalization rates and increase routine care for pets in China.", "In Brazil, we grew 8% operationally in the quarter behind the strength of our cattle and companion animal businesses. Investments in field force expansion and favorable market condition contributed to growth in cattle, despite recent industry and government headlines. And companion animal growth in Brazil was driven by new product introductions, including Simparica and Apoquel.", "Japan also made a significant contribution in the quarter, growing 17% operationally over the same quarter last year. Apoquel sales begin to normalize with distributors and better reflect the strong underlying demand in the local market. As a reminder, there was significant distributor stocking in Q3 of 2016, when we initially launched Apoquel.", "Key markets in Europe performed well in the quarter, as the U.K., Germany, France, Spain, and Italy all exhibited operational growth. The U.K. and Germany led the way at 12% and 8% operational growth respectively. Growth in the U.K. was driven primarily by Apoquel, while Germany's performance was due to strength in both Apoquel and Simparica. To summarize, very strong growth in our International business coming from a number of sources, including strong market trends, strategic investments, and our success in bringing new value-added products to market.", "Turning to the U.S., revenue grew 5% in the second quarter, companion animal grew 7%, and livestock grew 3%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica, and a number of other new product launches. U.S. dermatology sales were $74 million for the quarter, with Cytopoint sales reaching $15 million, exhibiting nice sequential growth as clinic penetration and dosing accelerate. As Juan Ram\u00f3n said, patient share also continues to grow for Apoquel and Cytopoint.", "As I mentioned earlier, Simparica sales were lower this quarter than last, but still in line with expectations. Our increased selling and promotional activity will lay the groundwork for continued revenue growth in this highly competitive market. We will continue to evaluate the performance of our direct-to-consumer promotional campaign for Apoquel and Simparica, with early indications suggesting that we are on track to meet our business objectives.", "Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new products including Diroban, which recently received approval for the treatment of dogs with heartworm. With the introduction of Diroban, Zoetis now offers veterinarians a full canine heartworm product portfolio, including prevention, detection, and treatment.", "Moving to U.S. livestock, sales grew 3% in the quarter, due primarily to our cattle and poultry businesses. Our cattle business returned to growth this quarter due to the success of products such as Actogain and Synovex, while sales of our premium injectable antibiotics continue to be impacted by healthier animals moving into the feedlots. As certain poultry producers expand their no-antibiotics-ever labels, our portfolio of medicated feed additives for these criteria are doing well and contributed to poultry growth in the U.S. We work closely with our customers to provide the necessary products and technical assistance to help them switch over when they choose. Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition for our Fostera PCV/M. hyo vaccine. Our updated vaccine product is seeing modest uptake with medium and smaller producers, and we will continue to work with customers to gain acceptance. Finally, both our cattle and swine businesses were impacted by the implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which negatively impacted our medicated feed additive performance, as producers are adjusting to the new regulation in how to adopt their protocols.", "Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 65.6% decreased approximately 230 basis points year over year on a reported basis and, on a sequential quarter basis, improved 120 basis points from the first quarter of this year. As I had mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, in 2017, we have made additional cost improvements in our manufacturing network. As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, we recognized higher costs associated with previously produced inventory, which depressed our gross margin. This change also had a negative impact on our second quarter margin, which we had previously indicated.", "The second quarter results for adjusted gross margin, while showing improvement over the first quarter, are slightly below our initial expectations. We have been working to improve our inventory management, including reductions in the level of inventory write-offs we incur. While we still expect to improve in this area for 2017, the magnitude of improvement is less than we had expected and will continue to be an area of focus in the future. Gross margin was also impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange in the quarter.", "Adjusted SG&A grew by 1% in the quarter, with higher investment in our DTC advertising campaign offsetting the expense reductions in other areas. Adjusted R&D declined 1% operationally for the quarter due to the timing of project spending and fixed expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiative.", "The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly improved from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of operational changes implemented in the third quarter of last year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we generated 11% operational growth in adjusted net income for the quarter.", "Moving to guidance for full year 2017. This year, we continue to perform in line with our expectations, with certain upsides and downsides, particularly with tax and cost of goods sold. For the year, we still except to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35%. Since our last update in May, changes in FX rates in several markets are favorable to revenue, and we are increasing both the lower end and higher end of the range as a result. We have also narrowed the range for revenue towards the high end of our guidance by $25 million to reflect our performance to date and our confidence in the remainder of the year.", "Our guidance for the range of cost of goods sold for the year has moved from 32% to 33% of revenue to approximately 33%. As we progress into the second half of the year, our results will more fully reflect the impact of our manufacturing cost improvements. Our updated view, however, also reflects the higher expense for inventory charges that I discussed earlier, as well as unfavorable mix and foreign exchange.", "For SG&A, we're increasing the low end of our range and maintaining the high end, consistent with the change in our revenue guidance. We have increased both the low end and high end of our R&D expense range to reflect additional investments, primarily as a result of the Nexvet acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange.", "Our guidance for an adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 29% from our pervious guidance of 30%. The favorable change is primarily due to jurisdictional mix and certain discrete item that have been realized in the first half of the year and does not take into account any potential tax changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pre-tax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. As a result of the aforementioned changes, we've increased the low and high end of the range for adjusted net income for the year.", "In the second quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares, and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q2. We expect our operating cash flow to grow through the year, allowing us to fund incremental investment in our business, including the including the $85 million used to purchase Nexvet last week.", "Just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we have delivered consistent operational revenue growth of 6% in the first half of the year. We expect positive trends in the uptake of new products and growth in international livestock to continue. Our earnings growth will accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, and cash flow generation will continue to improve, giving us greater flexibility to invest in our business. With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the lines for your questions. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll take our first question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hello? Oh, great. So just a couple of questions. So the first on \u2013 now that you've closed Nexvet, could you give a little bit more timing on the pipeline? How can we think about some of the products coming through? I believe they've got one canine and one feline drug coming in the research development pipeline right now. Could you just give us some tiny update there? And also, on the gross margin, could you sort of back out what the different headwinds were this quarter and sort of what the underlying growth rate was? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Derik. And I will take the first question, and then Glenn will answer the question on the gross margin.", "So, Nexvet, we completed the acquisition last week, on Monday last week. Our team, R&D team, it's now interacting with the R&D team of Nexvet, getting a getting full understanding of all the programs. When we have completed this analysis, then we will define when we expect to launch the product for both dogs and cats in both the U.S. and the European end markets. So it's a little bit too early now. But, again, so one thing that we need to remember is that we are in a market in where our competitors are not providing any detail in terms of R&D products, and providing too many details, and especially in an area that we think that can be also of high interest, will have a negative impact in our programs and maybe in the opportunity to generate future revenue growth.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "And in terms of gross margin, the cost of goods sold, so for Q1, our cost of goods sold was about 35.6% of revenue. In Q2 that improved to 34.4%. The key drivers of that were the costing methodology and the fact that we did recognize a disproportionate amount of the higher costs associated with previously produced inventory in the first half of the year. When you look at our guidance for the full year of approximately 33%, that definitely implies a significant improvement in the second half of the year after we're outside the costs associated with that previously produced inventory.", "Next question?", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks very much. Can you talk a bit more about your swine product performance? It seems like the vaccines have been under pressure for the last two or three quarter. Should we expect that to persist in the second half, or do you expect that to turn? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, John. Well, we mentioned that we have been working on our vaccine portfolio in both U.S. and international markets. We have seen good growth in international markets, but in the U.S. despite of \u2013 our portfolio now being much more competitive, we have not yet gained share as we expected. We remain confident that we have now a very strong portfolio. And very important, we also have products in our pipeline that will be reaching the market in 2018 that will bring this segment also to growth in the U.S. In the second half in the U.S. \u2013 that is also a question that you raised, I think \u2013 we'll be improving, but probably not improving as fast as we expected initially. On the other hand, in international, we expect continued growth and positive evolution of our portfolio in swine.", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. Two questions, and I'll try to ask them both upfront. First off, the PHARMAQ number was a bit light and, Juan Ram\u00f3n, curious if you think it's market or market share, and is there a revised figure for the year, which I believe stood at $125 million? And then sort of for the guidance and just looking forward, Glenn. The gross margin will obviously be better in 2H relative to 1H. So do we take that 2H 2017 and sort of use it as our runway for 2018? And then, finally, I know you don't guide quarterly, but just how do we think about the cadence behind revenue growth? Believe we should think about it greater \u2013 the revenue growth \u2013 greater in 4Q relative to 3Q just from a comp and days adjustment perspective. Thanks, guys.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Jon. And \u2013 well, the PHARMAQ was the main driver of our light performance in the quarter. SRS vaccine, that \u2013 it was a significant growth driver, and it's a vaccine for salmon in Chile \u2013 it's still showing significant result in terms efficacy and safety, and it's helping fish farmers in Chile to reduce their use of antibiotics. In the second quarter, we saw a reduction of the use of the vaccine, mainly because of pricing discussions. At the end of quarter, we reached price agreement with fish customers in Chile, and we have seen already in the first two months of the third quarter, the vaccine showing very good revenues and very good growth. We remain very confident that this segment will deliver long-term growth. In the quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, we expect double-digit growth, but you mentioned the $125 million will be below this amount. But, nevertheless, we expect that in the future years, the correction will be in line with our expectations.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "And, Jon, in terms of gross margin in the first half/second half, so as indicated with the guidance that we provided, we do expect a significant improvement in gross margin in the second half. Regarding the impact of that, and how you look at that for 2018, there are a numbers of factors that will impact the gross margin for 2018, including mix, foreign exchange, as well as the goals that we have in place from an inventory reduction perspective, which mainly just make some decisions that would have some impact on our ability to utilize overhead. While that would be the right impact from a cash flow perspective, it may have some negative impact from a P&L perspective. So there are a number of factors that'll impact gross margin for 2018, and when we provide guidance for 2018, you'll get better clarity on that.", "In terms of the guidance for the second half of the year from a revenue perspective, days has a minimal impact in the second half. We do have one more day in Q4, but other than that there's really nothing that would lead to a significant changes in growth between Q3 and Q4.", "Next question?", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Just following up on the question related to gross margins, are you still comfortable with your 200 basis point improvement after the 2017 initiative by 2020? Is that still on track? And also with respect to U.S. livestock, can you update us on the impact of meat prices this quarter and your expectations for the rest of the year? Thanks very much.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you for the question. So we are still seeing the opportunity of improving by 200 basis points in gross margin by 2020, and plans are moving ahead as expected.", "In terms of comments on the cattle business in the U.S., well, there are some positive factors that are really helping the cattle business in the U.S. One is the number of cows. It's expected to grow in 2017 and 2018. We also expect that the number of placements in feedlots will be higher than in 2016. And we also saw that the feedlot producers are generating profits in 2017, and we expect also the same in the second half.", "The price of the beef, it's also helping exporters to increase exportations to markets like Japan, markets like Mexico, and many other markets in where the beef it's \u2013 in the U.S. it's being exported. Also the prices of milk are positive. It is not related to beef, but we have seen an increase on the price of milk. It's still below prices that we saw in 2016, but this is also helping to rise the market. And at the same time, we have seen some headwinds in the U.S. market for our cattle. One was the mild weather in the first quarter that reduced the risk profile of animals and also had a negative impact in our premium antibiotics.", "The implementation of the Veterinarian (sic) [Veterinary] Feed Directive also had an impact in the first quarter, and we expect also having an impact in the remaining of the year. And finally, we have seen in the first half of the year that animals moving to the feedlots were heavier, again with a lower risk profile. In the second half, we expect that these animals will be medium size; that also will increase the opportunity for the cattle business. But in general we have seen that the prices in the different parts of the chain of production has been more positive than in 2016.", "Next question?", "Operator", "The next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.", "Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question I have is, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about some of your near- and long-term growth drivers, that being PHARMAQ, the Nexvet acquisition, and also the triple combo product, and how we should think about the peak sales potential for these products, and when we'll see some sort of meaningful accretion to earnings from these different products? And then the second question I have was just on diagnostics. Do you want a bigger footprint in diagnostics, and will you have to make additional investments to get there? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Well, definitely we described that we expect 2017 companion animal being the main driver of growth, and the same for 2018. And this will be coming from still growth of Apoquel, growth of Cytopoint and Simparica. For Apoquel, Cytopoint, we mentioned that $400 million to $500 million is what we expect in terms of peak sales. For Simparica, as a single agent, it was to generate more than $100 million, and when we introduce this three-combo product, then we'll update on our expectations. So we have not yet provided details of what we expect for Simparica platform, that will include the single agent plus also Stronghold Plus, later also Revolution Plus in the U.S. and also the triple combo.", "In terms of PHARMAQ, we are convinced that this will continue generating double-digit growth. We expect double-digit growth in 2017. We have not yet provided details for 2018. We'll be providing this information in a later date.", "On Nexvet, it's too early to define what are the projections for the monoclonal antibody for managing pain in both dogs and cats. So, in all the pain market for dogs, it's about $400 million and we also know that cat is a real unmet need. So we see also opportunities to bring a monoclonal antibody to manage that pain for cats.", "In terms of diagnostics, we acquired SMB; that also complements the previous acquisition of Synbiotics. Now we have future participation in two segments. One is the rapid test at point of care, and the other one is equipment that will be coming out of the programs which have been developed by SMB. We are convinced that SMB have very interesting platforms in different areas: chemistry, immunology, molecular, also specialty. And we'll be working on developing all of these programs to bring products into the market. It will be a phasing of introduction of products, and we are confident that end of 2017 or early 2018, we'll start introducing new products into the market.", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse", "Great, thanks. Can you speak to some of the initiatives you alluded to in you prepared remarks in terms of the manufacturing footprint and also the potential for further rationalization? It sounds like you continue to expect the 200 basis points in gross margin expansion associated with those initiatives, I guess starting in 2018, but could that process be expedited at all? And then my second question. You mentioned building cash flow, which I think that statement is still absent from the press release disclosure. But can you speak to capital deployment priorities, how is the M&A pipeline shaping up, and is Nexvet fully incorporated into your guidance at this point from an expense perspective? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Okay, thank you, Erin. We'll mention the comments on manufacturing initiative. So, first, we are \u2013 the manufacturing is always a continuous work in design opportunities for being more efficient. Reducing cost, it's a priority, but it's not the only priority that we have in design and manufacturing. We also want to make sure that we are improving the cost, at the same time ensuring that we have reliable supply. And at the same time that we are also working on reliable supply that we'll reduce our inventory levels. So this is something that is a target for the company. We identified a target for 2017, and we'll continue targeting inventory improvements over time.", "In terms of the initiatives that we already communicated is the 200 basis points by 2020. And you're asking if we can accelerate that. I think it's something that \u2013 we always try to do things as fast as we can, but at this point, what we are really targeting is to ensure that, by 2020, we generate these 200 basis points. And we also need to understand that, in some cases, these savings as a result of transferring the products from one plant to another plant or different plants, is something that it takes time, because it's a complex process to move products from different plants, and we need to make sure that when the product is in the final destination, it really delivers in terms of cost and also in terms of supply to the market. We also expect that, because of all the product rationalization, all the manufacturing plant rationalization, also we have opportunity for impact in terms of volumes and improving our allocation of overheads.", "In terms of cash flow and the priorities for our cash, we remain committed to invest internally, investing in commercial, and we have examples this year to invest in DTC campaigns to support new product launches. We also continue committed to bring innovation to the market internally with our R&D expertise and capabilities, and we see opportunities also for further expansion of some of the areas in where we think that we can improve our operations in terms of manufacturing, with special attention on ensuring that we have the right capabilities and capacity for vaccines in developed and also in emerging markets that also will be equally important. And we also mentioned that we, as a second priority, it's identified opportunities that will complement our internal efforts and will support further revenue growth and further profitability. And it's something that we are committed to identify these opportunities and bring these opportunities \u2013 to keep these opportunities \u2013 can bring values to our operations.", "And finally, you also asked in terms of Nexvet guidance. At this point, we are not yet providing any guidance in terms of Nexvet. It's too early. So we need first to have full control of all the programs that Nexvet has been \u2013 developed. We have access to some of these programs, but now that our R&D colleagues are really working together with Nexvet R&D colleagues, then we'll have a full understanding of the opportunity. So, Glenn will add some comments.", "Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.", "Yeah, Erin, just to clarify on the Nexvet. So for 2017, you'll notice that we did raise our R&D guidance, and that was to reflect the costs the we see for 2017 for Nexvet. Juan Ram\u00f3n comment was more in terms of long-term guidance for Nexvet.", "The other thing I just wanted to comment on was the manufacturing initiatives. There are certain investments that we are contemplating that will lead to some increased capital expenses that'll keep our capital expense as we move to 2018 probably more aligned with previous years. However, those initiatives we do believe will shore up supply for some of our newer products, some of our key products, as well as key products in key markets. And they'll also have the right return from a financial perspective, bringing our costs down on those products as well.", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC", "Good morning, guys. Just, Juan Ram\u00f3n, could you maybe give us an update on what you're seeing in the companion animal market? You guys gave some good detail on Simparica. Wanted to see why we saw the sequential decrease in Q2 and what your outlook is for distributor increases who are purchasing in the back half of the year. And do you plan on expanding your relationship with those distributors? And then secondly, on the production animal side, you've talked about the premium line of antibiotics like Draxxin. Did you say you expect the trend to reverse in the second half, where \u2013 kind of the midsize cattle being in the feed lots, and that could lead to increased sales?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Well, thank you, Kevin, for the two questions. So first on the companion animals. So on companion animal, we expect that we'll continue generating very positive growth in the second half, and we expect that the differential between companion animal and the livestock will remain in the second half of the year. We have seen in the second quarter growth in the U.S. of companion animal, 7%, while international market was 15%. I think it was in line with our expectations. The U.S. in the second quarter in companion animal, we had some additional promotional activities that also had a temporary impact in terms of prices, but the growth in the different parts of the companion animal portfolio have been in line with our expectations.", "Simparica also had additional revenues in the U.S. in the first quarter. That had an impact in the second quarter. But we don't see any situation that is different than what we expected, very pleased with the performance of new products, Apoquel, Cytopoint, and Simparica. All indicators are showing our progression in terms of market share improvement in both \u2013 for dermatology and also for parasiticide segment.", "And in the other inline portfolio, again, so we have not seen any change in the generic assumption, so I think it's something that \u2013 it's in line with the plan that we have seen in previous quarters, maybe occurring on Rimadyl that's has been affected by the interaction of Galliprant. Galliprant is another product for treating pain, and we know that in this market, new products, they get significant attention and growth. And this growth is maintained depending on the results that are showing in the mid and long term in terms of efficacy and safety. But we are very pleased with our overperformance in companion animal, and definitely it's a significant driver of our growth in the first half, and we expect also a significant driver of our growth in the second half.", "In terms of the trends for the cattle in the U.S., you mentioned the Draxxin impact. I will say that maybe \u2013 well, definitely the mild winter and also the heavier animals into the feedlot had an impact in terms of the use of premium antibiotics. The other impact that we have seen was also the implementation of the Veterinarian (sic) [Veterinary] Feed Directive that has been affecting our cattle business, especially the medicated feed additives. We saw that it was affecting temporary to smaller producers in the U.S., and they will be adjusting how to use these products in the future. This adjustment is taking longer, and we have incorporated in our guidance a more permanent impact in our revenue. But, having said that, we expect more favorable conditions in the second half of the year for cattle, and we also have seen that in the second quarter premium antibiotics has been performing very well in the year.", "Next question?", "Operator", "Your next question's from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David, can you check the mute function on your phone?", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Maybe we can try the next one?", "Operator", "Yes. We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the dermatology sector. Can you give us a little bit more color on Cytopoint, and how you characterize its use? Is it being used more every four weeks or every eight weeks? And are you seeing it used in more Apoquel-treated dogs or non-Apoquel dogs? And also just on Apoquel, can you talk about whether you're starting to see \u2013 getting any more traction in the acute and shorter-term settings as opposed to the chronic use? Thank you.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Kathy, and I will start with Cytopoint. And, first, I think Cytopoint has been \u2013 well, the indication of the label in the U.S., it's four to eight weeks. And we see that it's more used on the mid of this four to eight weeks than at four weeks. And we have seen also seen that Cytopoint in its infancy also having a 28% cannibalization to Apoquel. But combining both together, I think we are growing very nicely.", "And now I think we see the opportunity also to extend these experience to the European markets, in where we started the early experience program, and we expect a full launch in September in the European market. And in the European markets, the label, it will be different. It will be 1 milligram on four weeks, compared to 2 milligrams on four to eight weeks in the U.S. But still the products are very consistent in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety.", "For Apoquel, we have seen now that Apoquel use has been extended or increased in terms of acute, but also in terms of seasonalized conditions for dogs, and this is the result of now full availability of the product in the market, and we believe also the effort that we are making in terms of direct-to-consumer advertising. Chronic use will remain the main generator of revenues because the use will be very prolonged, but the acute or the seasonalized use of the product also will add significant opportunity.", "Next question?", "Operator", "We'll go next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Juan Ram\u00f3n, just want to clarify your comments on Rimadyl. So I guess the pain franchise was lower, because of new product competition and not cheaper generics from the distributors. And then a follow-up on Brazil. Very good performance there given everything that's going on. My understanding is that the USDA has banned fresh beef imports from Brazil because of safety concerns. Obviously we know there's other concerns there as well in Brazil. So what impact could all of this have longer term on your business? And is there an opportunity for U.S. livestock to do better as a result and gain share? Thank you very much.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Alex. So for the question on Rimadyl, So we are not saying that generic competition is not gaining share. It's gaining share in line with previous comments. And there \u2013 well, the message I wanted to convey was that we have not seen significant changes in the trends of the generic penetration. What we saw is that product, which is Galliprant, which is a new product that has been introduced recently, it's a product developed by Aratana and commercialized by Elanco, it has been gaining share in this pain market.", "We have seen also in the past that new products in this market are having rapid penetration, because it's still some level of dissatisfaction in terms of safety. And products coming into the market may have some opportunity, and definitely the opportunity will be maintained if it can really deliver on the expectations in the medium and long term. But we don't think that will be something that \u2013 we are confident that Rimadyl, with so many years in the market, with a very well-established profile in terms of efficacy and also in terms of safety, will remain a key player in terms of managing pain for dogs.", "At the same time, so moving into the acquisition of Nexvet, it's very strategic for us to maintain our leadership in this area. We are convinced that there is still unmet needs in this market in terms of safety and efficacy. And monoclonal antibodies can really fill this gap in terms of providing an alternative to current products in the market, and we are convinced that in both in dogs and cats, monoclonal antibodies will play a significant role.", "In Brazil, definitely the scandals are not helping, but we have been managing quite well. Our growth in Brazil despite of this political and scandals situation and we \u2013 the investments that we made in terms of expanding our field force are having a very positive favor. We are growing sales in Brazil very rapidly in cattle, but also in some other areas. Areas like companion animal is also driving significant growth. And Brazil in general has been a market exporting in most of the cases processed beef rather than fresh beef to some of the markets, and this is not really changing. And Brazil, they had a temporary challenge when they had the scandal in terms of the meat quality with China, but this has been already managed. And I think the prospects for Brazil are very positive, and definitely Brazil will be continue competing with the U.S., although today they are competing with a different quality of meat. U.S. is much more focused on quality, while in Brazil at this point they are much more focused on process, which has \u2013 not so important in terms of quality. So very positive in terms of future growth in Brazil, and also we see some additional opportunities in terms of export in the U.S.", "Next question please?", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and fitting me in here. Just wanted to see if you could talk a little more on the U.S. livestock fundamentals. You already talked about the beef cattle outlook into 2018, expecting expansion. But how long are you expecting expansion in the other species like chicken? And when we see contraction in any of those markets including cattle, what is the expected impact to the business, given that the animal health products are a lot less discretionary in nature? Thanks.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you, Brett. And so we think that the fundamentals of the U.S. livestock are very strong. So, in terms of cattle, I described that in our opinion, cattle will continue being an important part of the production of quality meat in the U.S. and also export to many other markets. We expect also that the growth in terms of number of heads in cattle will moderate in 2018, but still growing, which is positive. And we also think that in both in poultry and swine, the production in the U.S. is very efficient. They are very competitive. The consumption of animal proteins worldwide will continue growing, and the U.S. will continue playing a significant role in terms of producing the meat that will be reaching their customers around the world. The poultry and the swine, they are two areas in where they can manage very well the additional volumes. And we expect that in 2018, poultry and swine also will remain positive.", "If we move \u2013 I was making comments in general to the market. If we move to our specific business, so we expect both poultry and swine in the U.S., showing positive growth in 2018. So we expect to bring new products. And also we have seen that even for producers that are moving to No Antibiotics Ever, we can offer to these producers a very good portfolio that will meet their demand. At the same time, also we generate also a very positive growth in our company.", "Next question?", "Operator", "It appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, for any closing comments.", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.", "Thank you very much for joining us today. And we mentioned during the call, we are very pleased with the results. We are also very confident on the guidance for 2017. And, as I mentioned, companion animals will continue driving growth. But we see also positive growth in terms of livestock. We expect in the second half also maintaining the differential of growth that we have seen with the companion animal and livestock in the first half.", "With that, thank you very much for joining, and looking forward for meeting you again in the third quarter earnings call.", "Operator", "And this will conclude today's program.
