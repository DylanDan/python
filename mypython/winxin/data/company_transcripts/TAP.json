[Operator Instructions].", "Before we begin, I will paraphrase the Company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the Company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. ", "The Company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date they are made. ", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the Company's executives in discussing the Company's performance, please visit the Company's website at www.molsoncoors.com and click on the financial reporting tab of the investor relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. ", "Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the Company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year prior and in U.S. dollars. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thank you Andrea and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call and many thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning for Molson Coors we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, CEO of our U.S. Business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe Business; Stewart Glendinning, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; and Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and last but not least, Dave Dunnewald, our VP of Investor Relations. ", "On the call today, Tracey and I will take you through highlights of our full-year and fourth quarter 2016 results from the Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspectives on 2017. Now, clearly, the biggest news for 2016 was completing our acquisition of the remaining 58% of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio for $12 billion, representing the largest transaction in our Company's history which made Molson Coors the third largest global brewer. ", "We also retain the rights to all of the brand that were in the MillerCoors portfolio in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including REDD's and import brands such as Peroni, Grolsch and Pilsner Urquell. The transaction was completed at 9.2 times effective purchase multiple, including the present value of cash tax benefits. ", "Additionally, we will be driving substantial cost synergies in the next three years and we continue to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations. With the completion of the transaction and the changes we're making to align and enhance our organization, the building blocks are in place for our Company to drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead. ", "Led by our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda, these building blocks are grouped into four key areas. First, our organization and France are all under one roof for the first time. We've also reset our performance incentives around growth in sales, specifically volume and revenue per hectoliter, profit, cash and profit after capital charge or PACC, to help ensure top to bottom alignment with our key priorities and of course, those of our investors, including driving total shareholder return and performance towards our committed deleverage targets. ", "Secondly, our consumer excellence approach. Our global brand portfolio of Coors, Miller and Staropramen, supported by our national champion, craft and speciality brands, now gives a platform for accelerating performance outside of our core developed markets over time. Within our largest markets, we now have more opportunities to lift and shift our highest potential brands, creative platforms, commercial ideas and innovations to drive growth and value. ", "We remain absolutely focused on driving improvements in our core brand performance in the U.S. and Canada in particular. Outside of North America, Coors Light continues to grow volume at double-digit rates through 2016 and our largest brand was almost flat globally. Our Europe business increased retail volume and market share in the past year and our international business drove strong volume growth in high potential markets in Latin America and Asia Pacific. ", "Thirdly, our customer excellence approach. We're investing heavily in sales capability and execution improvement, including a suite of leading-edge sales technology and tools, supported by our new global commercial team with First Choice Learning Center, we've rolled this approach across all of our markets and are excited about the promise of this effort to drive incremental revenue, margin and profit. ", "The key metric we used to evaluate our customer engagement is a net promoter score or NPS and we're already making great strides in improving our NPS performance across all of our markets. In fact, for the first time in its history, MillerCoors finished number one in the most recent Tamarron Supplier Survey which pulls hundreds of U.S. distributors in rating the performance of beer, wine and spirits suppliers. We're building stronger partnerships by providing beer expertise, customer centric solutions and industry-leading service and results. ", "Progress is also reflected in other customer awards our teams have recently won, including the number one supplier ranking in the UK's advantage chain retail survey, Supplier of the Year across all categories by Tesco, the biggest retailer in the UK and the Supplier of the Year award from Boston Pizza, the largest on-premise chain in Canada. As one organization, we're lifting and shifting the best disciplines and customer solutions across markets, including bringing our U.S. Building with Beer tool to Canada and other markets this year. ", "And lastly, our focus on talent development, diversity and inclusion is really laser-focused in enabling our First Choice agenda and leadership capability right across our enterprise. With these building blocks in place, we believe that Molson Coors is positioned to grow total shareholder returns. The completion of the MillerCoors transaction represents a step forward in the size and strength of our business and this will drive some significant changes in our financial numbers in the near term as we align and enhance our financial reporting. ", "In order to provide more comparable financial information, unless otherwise indicated, all fourth quarter and full-year 2016 consolidated and U.S. results discussed on this call will be presented in a pro forma basis as if the MillerCoors transaction and its financing had been completed at the beginning of 2015. So, start with business highlights for 2016. ", "Overall, we're pleased with the progress our Company made last year. We increased global pro forma net sales per hectoliter 1.4% in constant currency for the year as we continued to achieve positive net pricing and to premiumize our portfolio towards higher margin, higher growth above premium brands. We exceeded our target for cost savings and we expanded pro forma underlying gross and pretax margins globally. ", "We reported nearly $2.4 billion of 2016 pro forma underlying EBITDA, an increase of 2.6% from the year before. And on an underlying pro forma basis, we grew pretax income 4.1% and after-tax income 1.9% for the year. ", "Now, I'd like to share some regional highlights from 2016. In the U.S. on a pro forma basis, MillerCoors domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.3% for the year as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. Total net sales per hectoliter, including contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 1.2% for the year. ", "We grew our share of the premium light segment with Coors Light completing its seventh consecutive quarter of increased segment share and it's best annual volume performance since 2012, while Miller Lite reached nine consecutive quarters of increased segment share. Coors Banquet which completed its tenth consecutive year of volume growth, gained segment share and came out of 2016 with accelerating volume trends. And above premium, we purchased three regional craft breweries during the year and began integrating these high-growth, high-potential businesses. ", "Although Blue Moon seasonals and REDD's had a challenging year, Peroni continued to grow volume and Henry's Hard Soda which was launched just over a year ago, became the number one hard soda franchise in 2016. Our U.S. team is also executing new strategies to improve the performance of our economy, economy brands which are already showing signs of progress. Miller High Life had it's best annual sales to retail performance since 2009. Overall STRs, however, declined 2.5% in the U.S. in 2016. ", "MillerCoors pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 2.5% driven by supply chain cost savings and lower commodity costs, partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption due to lower volumes. 2016 underlying pro forma pretax income in the U.S. was up 13.8% from the previous year as lower cost of goods sold, net pricing growth and positive sales mix were partially offset by lower volume. ", "In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.2%, driven by more than 1% of positive pricing and mix, partially offset by mix shift towards lower revenue packs and contract brewing volume. Our top line reflected growth in our above premier brands as Coors Banquet, Mad Jack, Belgian Moon, Creemore and our Heineken import portfolio all continued to grow volume and market share. ", "Meanwhile, market pressure on the mainstream segment, particularly in Quebec and the West, drove overall STR volume 2.8% lower for the year. Canada COGS per hectoliter decreased 1.1% in local currency, driven by cost savings and lower depreciation expense. These factors were partially offset by the impacts of volume deleverage, unfavorable foreign currency movements and inflation. ", "On the bottom line, 2016 Canada underlying pretax income declined 12.2% to $267.3 million, driven by lower volume, higher brand amortization, commercial investments and negative foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by cost savings and lower incentive compensation expense. We also determined that the fair value of the Molson Coor brands in Canada was lower than their carrying value, so we recorded an impairment charge of $495.2 million in the fourth quarter which is excluded from our underlying results. ", "In addition, we changed these brands to definite lived intangible assets which will be amortized over 30 to 50 years. Europe net sales decreased 0.9% in local currency for the year driven by the indirect tax provision of approximately $50 million recorded in the fourth quarter related to an ongoing legal dispute along with lower contract brewing volumes. Our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1% increase in 2016 Europe net sales revenue per hectoliter in local currency. ", "On the strength of our above premium brands, including Coors Light, Sharp's, Franciscan Well, Staropramen outside of Czech Republic and Rekorderlig Cider, we grew market share in the region with a 1.4% increase in owned, licensed and royalty sales volume. COGS per hectoliter in local currency increased 4.4% due to mix shift to higher cost product and geographies, as well as lower net pension benefit. ", "2016 underlying pretax income was 36.2% lower due to $86.2 million of cost increases relating to the indirect tax provision, brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and unfavorable foreign currency movements. ", "Our international business delivered strong results in 2016 with double-digit growth in net sales in owned and royalty volume as well as improved bottom-line performance. Higher owned and royalty volume was driven by the addition of the Miller global brands along with Coors Light growth in Latin America and Australia, while net sales increased due to higher volume and positive pricing. ", "This team improved 2016 financial performance significantly versus the year before and delivered on its profits commitment excluding the impact of foreign currency movements since 2013 and the total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India from earlier in 2016. Improved financial performance was driven by the addition of the Miller brands, volume growth in Latin America and Australia, favorable mix, positive pricing, cost savings and cycling the substantial restructure of our China business in 2015. ", "The integration of the Miller global brands within International, Canada and Europe is proceeding well in the first few months following the transaction close. But we're still in the early stages of assessing the historical and potential future performance of these brands. We're leveraging existing platforms and partnerships in some countries and establishing new supply chains and partnerships in other attractive new markets. ", "Regardless of the structure, all of our efforts are focused on leveraging our existing scale and brand presence to grow the Coor, Staropramen and Miller trademarks and our craft brands in key markets around the globe. Now, I will turn it over to Tracey to give financial highlights and perspective on 2017. Tracey? ", "Tracey Joubert", "Thank you, Mark and hello, everybody. Following the completion of the MillerCoors transaction, today's results reflect a number of changes we have made to our financial reporting in order to align and clarify our results. As Mark mentioned, we're providing pro forma results for the consolidated Company and U.S. business, including updates from refinements to purchase accounting and related tax-work functions and aligning the way we report our volume. ", "Current pro forma consolidated in U.S. results will be presented as if the transaction and its financing had been completed at the beginning of 2015. Canada, Europe, international and corporate results will not be presented on a pro forma basis. With that in mind, following our pro forma consolidated financial headlines for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 are as follows. ", "Net sales were down 4.2% in U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter and 2.3% for the full year, primarily due to currency movements and the indirect tax provision recorded in Europe as well as lower sales volumes in North America. On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the fourth quarter and 0.6% for the full year versus the same periods last year. ", "Our net sales per hectoliter in the constant currency decreased 0.8% in the quarter. On a full-year basis, net sales per hectoliter increased 1.4% due to positive pricing and sales mix. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported a pro forma net loss from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $608.1 million for the fourth quarter, down from $6.7 million of net income a year ago. ", "This decrease was driven by the impairment charge recorded for the Molson brands in Canada, higher U.S. GAAP tax expense and the indirect tax provision recorded in Europe. On a full-year basis, U.S. GAAP pro forma net income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors decreased 48.9% to $257.5 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter. ", "Fourth quarter pro forma underlying after-tax income increased 16.4% to $98.7 million or $0.46 per diluted share driven by 42% higher income in the U.S. and increased performance in international, partially offset by the indirect tax provision in Europe. Full-year underlying after-tax income increased 1.9% to $936 million, driven by 13.8% higher U.S. income and lower losses in international, partially offset by lower income in Europe in Canada. ", "Underlying pro forma pretax income increased 4.4% on a reported basis and increased 10.8% in constant currency for the fourth quarter. Full-year underlying pretax income increased 4.1% on a reported basis and increased 5% in constant currency. Pro forma underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $405.1 million, 4.6% higher than a year ago. For full-year 2016, our business reported $2.383 billion of pro forma underlying EBITDA, an increase of 2.6% from 2015. ", "Beginning in the first quarter this year, we tend to focus our consolidated and business unit performance discussions on underlying EBITDA which will allow greater comparability with other global brewers. On our last earnings call, we told you that we would provide transaction adjusted earnings per share which is how we look at value creation from the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. ", "Since then, the SEC has provided general direction to the market, reinforcing advise against non-GAAP measures. To respect that direction, we will provide components for you to make that calculation on your own. As we mentioned previously, this metric is calculated as the sum of three numbers, underlying after-tax pro forma earnings per share, transactional related after-tax book amortization and transactional related cash tax benefits. ", "In the fourth quarter, these three numbers were the underlying pro forma after-tax earnings of $98.7 million plus $9.4 million of transactional related after-tax book amortization and $63.9 million of transactional related cash tax benefits. Also, we had 216.4 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter on a pro forma basis. ", "For the full year 2016, these numbers were the underlying pro forma after-tax earnings of $936 million plus $37.5 million of transactional related after-tax book amortization and $275 million of transactional related cash tax benefits. We had 216.1 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the full year on a pro forma basis. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the fourth quarter and full year. ", "In the area of cost savings, we exceeded our 2016 goal by achieving more than $165 million of in-year cost reductions across our Company, driven by the U.S., Canada and Europe, with saving from MillerCoors exceeding $85 million on a pro forma basis, along with more than $80 million from outside the U.S.. These results benefited from significant non-synergy cost savings initiatives, such as the Eden and Alton closures which we do not expect to repeat in the near future. ", "We generated $864 million for underlying free cash flow in 2016 on an actual basis, but not pro forma, up from $724 million in 2015. This growth was driven by the addition of the other 58% of MillerCoors cash flows post transaction as well as strong working capital performance including lower underlying cash tax payments versus 2015. This strong cash generation allowed us to achieve a quick start on our deleverage goals by paying down $200 million of term debt prior to the end of 2016. ", "A detailed reconciliation of our 2016 and 2015 underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release this morning. Total debt at the end of 2016 was nearly $12.1 million, while cash and cash equivalents totaled $561 million resulting in net debt of $11.5 billion. Looking forward to 2017, all of the following metrics now include 100% of MillerCoors results. ", "Currently, we expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million in 2017. We anticipate 2017 pension income of approximately $24 million. Our 2017 capital spending outlook is approximately $750 million based on foreign exchange rates at the end of 2016. ", "The increase in planned expenditures for 2017 is driven by the addition of MillerCoors capital expenditures, work on our new brewery in British Columbia and spending to capture transactional related synergies and other cost savings. Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2017 is approximately $370 million plus or minus 5%. ", "We expect our 2017 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 8% assuming no further changes in tax laws, declarements of tax orders, excess tax deductions or share-based compensation or adjustments to our [indiscernible] in tax position. And this range is consistent with our current expectation for our long term tax rate. We expect our cash tax rates to be significantly lower than this range due to the cash tax benefits related to the MillerCoors transaction. ", "U.S. legislative initiative to reform U.S. tax laws could have a significant impact on our tax rates and our cash tax expectations and we're following these developments closely. The post-transaction integration of our business and cost synergies capture are progressing well with the following updates, the North American supply chain is driving to create a more efficient fixable production network and we're evaluating options in light of the recent U.S. border tax proposals. ", "Global procurement has 24 integration projects in flux with four already complete. Our global business services locations have been agreed in North America and Romania and we're focused on building world-class globalization of processes and digital leverage to provide sale, efficiency and effectiveness across our new business services network. In commercial, we have finalized the selection of global media partners and transferring our U.S. return on marketing investment or ROMI, model to both Canada and Europe. ", "And finally, Miller global brand integration has proceeded as planned in each of our business units. We have confirmed the sale and distribution structures for two-thirds of the Miller global brand volume with a balance operating in the near term under transitional service agreement. ", "For cost savings, we continue to target $550 million of all in savings which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses as well as transactional related synergies, all of which we plan to deliver by the third full year of our combined Company which is 2019. Related to this cost savings goal, we fully anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of one-time incremental cash costs over three years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first two years of the program. ", "In the first year of this three-year program, we plan to deliver more than $175 million of all in cost savings in 2017 with most of these expected to come from non-synergy initiatives. We plan to capture the majority of our transactional related synergies in 2018 and 2019. Going forward, we will provide quarterly updates on transactional related items that we previously discussed, including our realized cash tax benefits and incremental amortization. ", "We continue to expect transactional related cash tax benefits to average more than $275 million per year for the next 15 years. But we now anticipate that these benefits will be somewhat front-end loaded in the first few years, with the later years slightly lower than the $275 million average. In addition, we expect transactional related amortization of approximately $37 million annually on an after-tax basis. ", "Finally, our underlying free cash flow target for 2017 is $1.1 billion plus or minus 10%. This target is consistent with the preliminary target we provided on our last earnings call and an increased impact of incremental cash paid for interest and synergy related capital in 2017 as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. This 2017 free cash flow target excludes planned capital spending relating to building our new British Columbia, as this multi-year project is being funded largely by the sale of our former brewery in Vancouver early in 2016. ", "As far as our cost outlook is concerned for the full year 2017, we expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in MillerCoors to increase at low single-digit rates and Canada COGS to increase at mid-single-digit rates in local currency. We expect our Europe COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency and our international business COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a double-digit rate. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Mark? ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Tracey. In 2017, we will continue to play to win via our First Choice consumer and customer agenda. In the U.S., as we move forward in 2017, we will continue to drive towards our goal of flat volume in 2018 and growth in 2019. ", "We'll again invest heavily in our flagship brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite, plus Coors Banquet. Coors Light recently launched a new extension of the Climb On campaign built on our continued commitment to sustainability which we believe will resonate with a growing number of consumers who support brands and make the world a better place. ", "And above premium, Henry's Hard Sparkling and new products to play in the growing alcoholic sparkling water category will be launched nationally in March with lemon lime and passion fruit flavors, while REDD's and Blue Moon Belgian White will introduce new aluminum pint packaging in the second quarter. ", "Tenth and Blake, the craft and import division of MillerCoors will continue its focus in integrating and rapidly expanding the geographic reach of our craft acquisitions. As an example, the Tarrapin Beer Company will reopen its brand new taproom and micro-brewery and The Battery Atlanta, adjacent to SunTrust Park which will soon be the new home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. In addition, Tenth and Blake will accelerate efforts on Peroni to drive incremental growth. ", "Finally, we're implementing a range of new initiatives to boost our economy portfolio. Miller High Life has new marketing and redesigned packaging, the Keystone family will unveil new packaging early this year and Mickey's is bringing back its popular large format glass bottle packaging. In First Choice customer engagement, beside the Tamarron, when more than 15 retailers recently named MillerCoors their supplier of the year. ", "And we increased production flexibility across our brewery network and ramped up two new aluminum pint filling lines in Fort Worth and Shenandoah to meet demand for this package. We also remain committed to developing and maintaining strong relationships with our U.S. distributors. ", "In Canada, our First Choice agenda will be focused on bringing back momentum to the top line through a relentless focus on our two largest brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian in the premium segment. We look forward to a launch of the new Molson Canadian campaign celebrating Canada's 150th anniversary this year and to aligning the Coor Light creative platform with the U.S. Climb On campaign. ", "We'll also drive for further growth in above premium by Coors Banquet, Mad Jack, Belgian Moon and the Heineken brand family. While MGD will be the main focus Miller brand in the short term, we're fine-tuning the potential roles of Miller Lite and Miller High Life to further strengthen our portfolio. Our customer relationships remain one of our key assets and there will be increased call efficiency in 2017 and more focus on in-store execution of our brand campaigns across all channels. ", "We will also continue to transform our cost base to ensure we maximize our future competitiveness, including in our brewery network. In Europe, our First Choice consumer agenda now includes the Miller brands as well as the international license and export business in the region starting on January 1 so that we're now driving Staropramen, Coors, Carling and Miller with fully-aligned strategies across Europe. We're also continuing to build our craft portfolio, including Sharp's, Franciscan Well and further expansion of Blue Moon across the region. ", "In January, we purchased a controlling interest in the Spanish craft brewery, La Sagra. Located near Madrid, La Sagra expands our craft portfolio in the world's 11th largest beer market and offers a new distribution partner in Spain for Blue Moon Belgian White. In customer excellence, our overall Europe net promoter score increased again in 2016 for the third year in a row, with 9 out of 11 countries improving their customer rating. In the UK our key accounts in convenient retail customers scored as number 1 out of 21 beverage suppliers. ", "Our international business is now much bigger with the addition of the Miller global brands, including attractive developing and emerging markets. Beginning on January 1, we also changed our Puerto Rico business reporting to the international segment so that one team is now managing the entire Caribbean while at the same time transferring the European MCI markets to our Europe business. ", "We're building on our existing Coors Light momentum in Latin America and leveraging opportunities to grow the Coors and Miller brands in high-opportunity market using an asset-light model by our strong partnering and local license agreements. The addition of the Miller global brands complements our growth strategy and we've already hit the ground running in key priority markets. ", "In existing priority markets, such as Australia and Honduras, where our partners have already embraced Coors Light, we're ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. In the attractive new markets, we have begun expanding distribution with local partners, on-boarding our country managers and activating local transition service agreements. ", "To summarize our discussion today, we're pleased with the overall progress our Company made in 2016. In addition to completing the MillerCoors and Miller global brands acquisition and moving quickly to integrate our business, we exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings and expanded pro forma gross margins and underlying pretax margins globally. We grew our above premium business globally, gained share of the key premium light segment in the U.S. and accelerated the growth in performance of our international business. ", "As one Company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands and a highly focused Leadership Team, we have the building blocks in place to leverage our increased scale, resources and combined commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long term shareholder value. Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. ", "As usual, our prepared marks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 1:00 PM Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. So at this point Andrea, we would like to open up for questions, please. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Vivien Azer", "I was hoping we could drill down a little bit on the U.S. business. In particular some of the evolving dynamics that you're seeing in the competitive landscape and specifically at economy price points. Can you talk a little bit about some of the discount names that we're really seeing in the us and what you think these are rational choices that are being made in the subsegment? Thanks. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks for that question, Vivien I will ask Gavin to give some color. I think the context before we get into that detail is just look at our NSR per hectoliter performance in the U.S. which actually 2016 versus 2015 was relatively solid which is I think a good place to start the conversation. Gavin, do you want to just talk a little bit about the progress we're making on the economy and what pricing environment looks like? ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sure good morning, Vivien. Look, I mean I just reiterate what Mark said right as our fourth quarter net pricing grows was only slightly than the growth we achieved for the full-year and for the full-year of 2016 growth of 1% is actually higher than we realized in 2015 so we're not really seen a deceleration of pricing. As it relates specifically to our economy portfolio and the economy beer segment is binge drinking relative to economy wines and spirits. Obviously we engaging the economy beer drinker is really important. Our strategy and economy is actually designed to bring more value to our drinkers across our brands. That's not a price focus strategy.", "The economy represents a significant volume for us it represents a significant volume opportunity for us and it's important that we get drinkers into the economy portfolio rather than getting to cheap wines and spirits because once they are in their that is where they tend to stay they grow loyalty to beer. As far as the progress we're making is concerned Miller High Life has moved away from the more hipster I am rich campaign we're now focusing on if you've got the time we've got the beer campaign and the brand had its best quarterly annual performance in seven years. In fact in the public Nielsen data that we actually grew share and grew volume in early February of this year.", "We're offering better value at retail to our customers with Keystone light 15 packs this is the 12 pack, Milwaukee's Best introduced a new packaging and looking were taken the alcohol up a Milwaukee's Best on regular and on ice. We've taken alcohol content on ice house up and Hamm's which has been around since 1865 has begun to reposition itself in certain geographies at opening price points. I'm pleased with the progress that we've made on our strategy for economy and it's really important for us as a business that we keep our drinkers in beer as opposed to wine and spirits. ", "Vivien Azer", "Can I squeeze in one more? ", "Mark Hunter", "Sure. Why not, Vivien?", "Vivien Azer", "Thanks, guys. So if we're looking at the price mix realization or the net revenue per hectoliter that you saw in the fourth quarter you guys have announced there's going to be a change in terms of the funding split between you and your distributors. What would that have look like if that changed had gone into effect in the beginning of the fourth quarter just so we understand the relative benefits of making that change? ", "Gavin Hattersley ", "We're changing domestic industry standard 50/50 on all package beer and we worked very hard to ensure that the model is consistent keeping both MillerCoors and our distributors net revenue neutral point in time. It's all about executing our pricing strategy versus someone else's. The change will ensure that we can equally share in investments and benefits from a joint customer point of view we're ultimately make better choices together but it's revenue neutral. So you will see changes in our finance reporting on the sales revenue. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen Powers of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Powers", "Actually two things if I could. One is just a quick clarification. I may have missed it but did you realize any savings against your three-year plan in fourth quarter that just concluded? That would be the first question and just kind of building of Vivien's question on the economy as you ramp up the economy focus how certainly a repercussions have you taken that you can draw attention from economy wine and spirits are competitor beer brands and not cannibalize from elsewhere in your portfolio? ", "Mark Hunter", "To start on the first question, just to be clear I mean the $550 million of savings and ounce for the next three years start from the beginning of 2017 and we have given you the specific cost savings that we've achieved through 2016 was that what was actually right at the top end of our expectation, principally driven by the fact that we had the Eden and often closures in 2016 of those were significant nonrecurring event. So as you think about comparables, I would push them to one side because as I said they are nonrecurring events but the $559 is still solid the next two years and obviously as I said we will update that progress against that on a regular basis and update more fully on an annual basis.", "On your question on the economy brands to be fair I think, Gavin really colored most of what we're doing there. We're ensuring that our portfolio is fit for purpose, operational consumer value and makes our economy brands attractive relative to the choices that are available in economy spirits and economy wines so we believe that we're strengthening our relationships with drinkers bringing drinkers back into our brands by offering value across the portfolio. A measure there's really anything else to add to that. ", "Tracey Joubert", "The thing I would add to a, market is that we haven't seen impact on our premium brands effect we actually increase share meaningfully in the fourth quarter and December was actually one of our best year months in a very long time. In economy strategy went to back into the year. In fact we grew segment share with Miller Lite and Coors Light for 20 consecutive months. I haven't seen that impact that Stephen refers to and is certainly not a strategy. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Laurent Grandet", "Actually ever go on the other side of the beer segment somewhere the premium one. You have been saying that you transferred the Blue Moon brand from tense and Blake to your core business can you tell us I mean where you stand on that transfer and how it is working? And also all the different initiatives you do to drive that revenue back to hectoliter. ", "Mark Hunter", "Gavin you want to pick up on Blue Moon and I think it's important to talk Blue Moon Belgian white obviously the seasonal part of that business and industries? Have been under a lot of pressure do you want to update? ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sure, thanks. We originally conceived Blake in 2010 to crippled and expand crap rents like blooming in Leinenkugel's and some of the iconic bronze with like Perrone and since that time Bloomington Leinenkugel's have grown from regional powerhouses into really national mainstay so holding their own through this explosion of choice and different styles and given the scale and size of these two brands and made absolute sense for us to move it into the marketing department or each of the marketing departments and the move has gone particularly well.", "Mark referred to the seasonals and variety packs and yes Bluemoon has lost volume on seasonals and variety packs that this is industry wide and Bluemoon is no different to anybody else. Blue Moon Belgian white we've made some tweaks to our above the line and we're seeing the early benefits of that with meaningful trend improvements in the fourth quarter and into 2017 so I guess the short answer is the transfer has gone well. ", "Mark Hunter", "Laurent, I think your question just talked about how we're driving our and as our per hack right across our business the focus in all geographies is really about how we premium eyes our portfolio and if you look at our results across Canada, Europe and more broadly our international business we're only playing in the above premium segment is a return orientate the Business thought the same time recognizing economic engine is still our mainstream brand it's the power we've got to keep our big mainstream brands performing well and we talk share improvements particularly our biggest market, the us what the same time premium is in our portfolio and that is what we're about and that is what we will continue to focus on. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Judy Hong", "I wanted to follow up with a few questions on the cost savings. Given that 2016 actually came in at the high end of your range, can you talk about the potential upside to your $175 million target 2017 as part of your three-year cost savings target and it seems like we're actually looking for a step down versus 2016 so just wanted to get a little bit more clarity around that. And then can you tell us in terms of split of Miller's curve versus other segment with that $175 million target and Tracy I think you talked about potentially looking at supply-chain opportunities and evaluating it in light of the potential border just ability as part of the corporate tax reform so if you could talk about the implication of the total number that you set out? ", "Mark Hunter", "Judy, that's cheating there was about 18 questions and not one. ", "Judy Hong", "Cost savings. ", "Mark Hunter", "I think that was kind of three groups there so on the first one in relation to 2017 versus 2016 I think I covered that earlier 2016 a which we're very pleased about was kind of inflated versus what you call the normal normalized number because of the closure of Eden and Alton brewery, as though there are nonrecurring but very significant events to make a looking at 2016 and 2017 will start to strip out that impact. The $175 million number that we guided for trend for 2017 is in a that we feel confident that we will be focused on delivering and as we always intended to do we set our sales a target we try to meet him period that is what will attempt to do you through 2017. And that will be solid progress against our longer term $550 million of savings. With regard to the North American supply-chain, to and you want to just talk to how we're thinking about the? ", "Tracey Joubert", "So we have plans in place. We're making costs possible because it's very difficult very early to predict andcomment on any kind of changes that will come from tax reform that the administration is looking at. We have plans, we plan on if something changes we will make sure that they we can change direction. ", "Judy Hong", "Tracey if I could just follow up so the last earnings call there was some confusion around the free cash flow guidance and obviously came up with $1.1 billion that's in line with what you given us but any kind of color you can give us in terms of what you think you one-off or one-time items within that $1.1 billion number would be for 2017 that would be appreciated? ", "Tracey Joubert", "The guidance has remained consistent with what we told you is $1.11 billion plus or minus 10%. We don't break out that affects our free cash flow but some of the factors that probably you should consider is we've spoken about the incremental CapEx is going to be required to capture synergies and other cost savings and most of that will come in 2017 and 2018. If you recall we did tell you that the total cash cost was around $350 million to deliver the synergies and cost savings, that's when to be split evenly between CapEx and OpEx over the next three years. The other item to consider around free cash flow is we've got the incremental cash interest as a result of acquisition date sell that's a step up on that line. And then other items that affect us would be things like pension contribution, timing of working capital changes and then cash taxes on incremental income from the U.S. which is now a higher proportion of our income so that will also affect the free cash flow. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel. Please go ahead. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "Hey, Mark. Continuing one of the topics that to the race, Tracey the comments made about the related synergies is that the majority will be realized in 2018 and 2019. So, the obvious question is what you mean by majority? I doubt you will tell us the difference between 50% and 99% but as you think about moving past these next three years and the due diligence he will be doing on opportunities is it fair to think very up this morning areas for incremental savings is a procurement is a commercial is a commercial of just trying to get a sense of where the additional savings might come from over the next few years. ", "Mark Hunter", "Let me offer a couple of comments there, Mark we're going to get into splitting out the detail of the $550 million. We have said that the synergies related element which if you remember we did talk about in our last call which has come in as a bigger number and a faster number so faster realization which is good news, it's principally weighted into years 2018 and 2019, 2017 is more of a transition year as the businesses together we can all of the work streams up and running to moving any volume around the network requires significant planning and CapEx investment I forgot about phasing we've got in the fact those $550 million of savings will be in the year by the end of 2019.", "I don't want to give any further detail be on the. I think is our businesses come together in the markets, our ability to flex production across geographies but also how we can generate additional revenue synergies as we transfer some of our commercial excellence capabilities around our business which is so central to my approach something I think will unlock real value for us actually improving are overall commercial performance, First Choice agenda and the thing and shifting as practice ideas whether that's pricing and revenue Management plugging portfolio gaps and getting behind brands that we've launched that are working well and one geography, moving them to other geographies. All of that is ahead of us and for me opportunity and exciting but more of that to come I think into course. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "That's very helpful. And to build on that, Mark, commercial and customer excellence sure is contributing to this upgrade your seen among distributor in the U.S. and the way they are ready versus other suppliers. Is also translating it seems into and Gavin you pointed this out, to improve sure per transfer premium life but your overall share trends are quite unfolding the way you would like. Can you talk a little bit about what in that customer excellence focus is to come so to speak that can translate into either a pickup in the pace of sure taking and premium life or an improvement in the performance of other aspects of your portfolio. ", "Gavin Hattersley", "I actually think that we're very pleased with our sure performance, Mark, 22 straight months of performance highest we've had in many years and the month of December. But if you peel back the various brands, Mark, Coors Light four proceeding quarters we've had the best run since 2012. We've upgraded the regional identity on Coors Light and we're going to be building on the time on campaign to sustainability efforts as we head into summer. Miller Lite has had very positive volume growth in three of the last nine quarters which represents the best performance that we had from the brand.", "It goes back to the change in the original packaging in 2014 and then it is very different campaign. 'S we're pleased with the platform for which we could for Miller Lite and 2016. Coors Banquets achieved its tenth consecutive year of growth in 2016 with the front have performance in the low single digits and accelerating in the second half of the year than to mid-single-digit growth and we're going to be building a campaign as we go forward. We're introducing Spanish-language TV to go after the Latino segment of beer drinkers. I think are really covered our economy strategy and our economy portfolio strategy early enough, Mark I'm not going to repeat all that. ", "Mark Hunter", "So Gavin the only thing I would add in and Mark just for information is we wanted the decisions I've made is to take a portion of our synergies and reinvest our back into our business into our global growth team our commercial excellence team in the focused around a handful of areas so we're investing more pretty fundamental segmentation analysis which will inform an awful lot of our portfolio decision-making going forward and that's been done consistently across our business unit.", "We got a stronger broader global innovation team in place to drive for more disruptive innovation. We've now got a new, global digital team in place is for each of our business units with best practice. We've got small global brands team in place and a global customer excellence team focused on things like our MPS performance, field sales Management, pricing and revenue Management so for us to get different outputs going forward, we're making some changes in our business from an input perspective which I think will stand as in good stead as I look out over the course of the next 35 years and really building the commercial muscle of our organization over 18,000 people now lined up behind our First Choice agenda and I'm convinced that will pay dividends to our business as we move into the future. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "And if I can make one last one on the global dimension, Mark, of course the international Miller business is now yours. Can either you or Tracy can you give us some sense of the dollar amount we're talking about in terms of the cost of owning that either in year one? And the slope so to speak on that number? Because you need to layer and costs, you addressed it in your prepared remarks but I don't have a good sense of the dollar value. We put something in our model that can you give us some sense of the year one increment there and then with the slope on that number might be over the next few years? ", "Tracey Joubert", "I thought you might ask that question, the short answer is no at this stage, Mark. We are on our pro forma, we've excluded the Miller international brands and we're still working through the fine detail of the trailing EBITDA number. And then the aspirations moving forward. Is complex because it wasn't a definitive kind of business unit within SAB and it was spread across all of their operating units.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Do you want to just give a little bit of color though on what you are seeing in some of the markets and how you're looking at that business? ", "Mark Hunter", "Look, Mark I think to Mark's point more detail to come later but I think broadly we've had a very good start. We transition many of the markets of the PSA's. River excited about the prospect for the brand. As you might imagine of course there are some markets that are performing better than we expected, some markets that are performing as well but broadly speaking these are strong, growing markets that are now open the door for our other brands, have brought send scale to bear in existing markets where we're already selling course products and I think about a very strong opportunity going forward. ", "Tracey Joubert", "And Mark the only thing I would add is, continue very much focused around are asset light approach, working on Partnership's and a license and export basis that has served as well and I think from a relative cash use framework that we have articulated pretty consistently I think is the right approach for our business. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Andrew Holland of Societe Generale. Please go ahead.", "Andrew Holland", "A couple questions if I may. Firstly, you refer in your remarks about Europe to the ongoing legal dispute and you put a $50 million indirect tax provision in the quarter. Can you just remind us what is going on there, what's behind that and what this sort of outcome is and whether there is any danger of needing any further provisions in 2017? And a slightly more detailed one can you just give us an idea of what your UK volumes have done in the year? And then perhaps thirdly could you just give us an idea of your trading year-to-date in the New Year? ", "Tracey Joubert", "Sure, so kind of in reverse order we don't give a trading update and that's a change that we made last year Andrew so the biggest slice of our business now is are U.S. business and the scanner detail is in the public domain so I would just refer you to that or any other data and any other markets we don't give short term trading updates. With regards to our UK binds someone as Simon just talk about in a second he can set that in the context of how our European business is performing and to your first question around the provision that we took, that's an ongoing legal dispute so we can't really get into any further details.", "Our review is that's the best estimate of the potential requirement on a multiyear basis. There is further detail in our 10-K which gives you a sense which gives you little bit more color. And really refer you to look at that but $50 million provision is really four year perspective so that gives you a sense of let's call it and your requirements because it's an ongoing legal dispute I can get into any more detail than that. I think to your second question, Simon to just want to talk about the UK and more broadly are European performance? ", "Andrew Holland", "Yes.", "Tracey Joubert", "Thank you Andrew. It's been a strong quarter four both the UK and European business. So you asked specifically about the UK. We continue to do well on premium citation we've had strong performance from Coors Light, continued good performance from our craft brands in the UK and Franciscan well and repatriation of our UK business also going very well. Along with our new entry through the quarterly brand supporting that together along with our very strong performance in the eyes of our customers where we have not been for sure is a number of channels in a number of customers, our UK business is in very good shape.", "If I put the UK business in context the European business is probably helpful to note or more helpful to you guys actually to get our European business performance, taking aside the indirect tax provision which by the way has been an issue spanning just over four years. So if I took that to one side of the a full-year issue weighing on every single quarter it gives you a very distorted picture.", "If I give you the underlying fundamentals of the European business, there pretty strong. In quarter 4 we grew our volumes by 2.5% and we gained share at our Q4 share was accelerated share gain versus the rest of the year. In combination with that we grew our net sale revenue by 3.1% and if I take the tax provision to one side and give your number and constant currency, our underlying pretax profits grew by over 20%. So we would be very successful by the UK performance driven by immunization First Choice for customers in the overall European performance through Q4 and that pretty much reflects the year that we've had in Europe as well. ", "Andrew Holland", "Okay just sorry just to clarify for the year or as a whole, I think your volumes, if I can make head or tails of the tables were down in Europe and for the year just marginally. And I'm just interested to know whether that was because of Continental Europe or the UK or both? ", "Tracey Joubert", "Our own brand volumes Andrew, our own brand and royalty volumes are up 1.4% so the slight decline you see is really driven by contract manufacturing. And I would point to in terms of underlying business underlying business 1.4% growth we would regard the along with our pricing and our next performance for the full-year to be good performance we've taken share we've grown up, we've grown our revenue and we've managed to grow that sells revenue per hectoliter across the or 0.4% so I think the suite of those metrics we be very pleased with. ", "Dave Dunnewald", "So just to help you with navigating to the financials at the top of the summary of operations for example the year business those volume numbers of what we call financial volume and they include not only some brand volumes and things that flow through the P&L but also contract period and also factored brand line which is part of our new volume policy for this year. What Simon was talking about to find call it brand volumes owned and royalty and so forth in the narrative of the release and the prepared remarks for the call. ", "Operator,", "Our next question comes from Robert Bronstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Robert Bronstein", "A couple of questions thank you a couple questions on the U.S. business. First just in terms of Q4 and implications on Q1 can you talk a little about the fairly significant difference between the best years the STWs in the U.S. and Q4? As well as any impact from calendar issues and the weather on the market and are performance? ", "Gavin Hattersley", ",", "One change we made this year is we kept arbors up and all the way through the end of the year which is different from what we've done in the past we want to make sure that we cover dollar distributors orders we did that we did fulfill all the orders we received. We didn't push any inventory into our distribution network. We did have somewhat higher inventories as a result of the overall industry reduction in December. Our share was actually as good as it's been for a while but the overall industry as you know right across the alcohol and package goods was down in December so that drove our inventories up a little bit.", "The higher inventory level we had, Robert, certainly helped us with our service in the first month of the year. And we reduced our stocks and improved service quite meaningfully compared to previous years in the January. From a whether point of view the only real weather impacts we've had at the end of the year were some freezing conditions in both Milwaukee and Colorado which led to some challenges with Bluemoon and Bluemoon inventory but other than that no. As far as 2016 is concerned [indiscernible] inventory levels at the end of the year but our current plan is to ship to consumption in the year. ", "Robert Bronstein", "So if it wasn't weather related what happened in the industry in December than? ", "Mark Hunter", "Robert, I'll leave it up to you. Despite the fact that we were down in volume I was very pleased with our share performance particularly in the premium light segment and as I said we saw particularly good performance coming out of only parts of our economy strategy with dollar highlife and I'll be repeating myself if I go into all that again. ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Robert if you look more broadly across alcohol in CPG their just seem to be a general sluggishness in terms of demand I think we're wrestling to pinpoint why particularly at a time where there was so much frothing as an exuberance on the stock market so it remains a little bit of a mystery but it was I think a broad CPG kind of weakness through the month of December and is difficult to say it was due to X or Y. ", "Robert Bronstein", "And Gavin a bigger picture question on U.S. beer. One of the striking things that we saw in 2016 was a fairly significant slowdown in the craft sector and lots of reasons for that for some changes at least what we're hearing in terms of retailers in terms of their sets may be knocking out some long tail of some of the smaller crafts. So could you kind of give your assessment big picture in terms of what's going on in the beer market in the U.S. with the American consumer, what's happening with craft and retailers and how you're positioning yourself to take advantage of that? ", "Mark Hunter", "Robert, it's Mark here. Let me pick up because this could be a long conversation that may come back to I think some of the comments we made to last year. I think the prognosis is that craft has been great from a beer industry evolution perspective it's brought more drinkers any more conversations about sales and provenance and that's good for beer and its long term health and sustainability. It would appear to be the case that we're probably in a bit of an oversupply situation and many of the craft brands which are very across styles which are very occasions specific, mean that there is probably a limitation as to how brought that craft footprint can become. ", "Many retailers I think are now recognizing that they have got inefficiencies on their shelf sets and too many SKUs which are too specialized and certainly the more sophisticated retailers as would come through 2016 have been asking us for support and building with their approach to Gavin and team have in our category Partnership's actually help many we tellers shift sell shots and drive efficiency and velocity appoint a purchaser think you will see that continue to 2017 and beyond and the people that one that will be the big national craft brands of corporal clarity of positioning and distinctiveness of brands like our will place.", "Regional brands have got meaning across both the states and you'll continue to see a lot of local term and very small very local label profiles et cetera in many retailers will continue to give that visibility and presence but overall there should be a simple vacation of the offer from a sharper perspective. Gavin I don't know if I missed anything in that in a brief summary? ", "Robert Bronstein", "Coming into 2017 to believe you will have more equal or less shelf space and display space at your major retailers? ", "Mark Hunter", "Robert some of the big retailers have modified their assortment strategies just address out of stocks and to improve inventory turn. We believe that's the inevitable evolution as Mark said the number of SKUs that been added to the beer category over the past two years so overall we actually agree with that. And in some areas I would say that it has improved our positioning and in some areas it hasn't I think it's coming into 2017 we'll us is that. In its totality. But it's a strategy that we agree with because focus to core packages and provides a healthy balance between out of stocks and variety. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. ", "Bryan Spillane", "I've got a couple of small picture questions I guess. One is on the tax provision. I think you covered this in response to a previous question. The $50 million provision that you took in Europe, the Europe segment it's sort of a one-time cost. You're making an accrual, based on what your best estimate of the exposure would be so as were sort of modeling next year, we wouldn't come to me that you've got, that there would be the estimate correct, we wouldn't and that $50 million to next year. Is that right? ", "Tracey Joubert", "That is our current best estimate of what is called the exposure and it's an aggregated four year timeline. There's a little bit more detail in the 10-K, Brian but I think that's a fair assessment. Where we're at this point time. ", "Bryan Spillane", "So given that is not a period cost specific to the fourth quarter, it knocked about $0.18 or $0.20 of the quarter? ", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. That's factually correct. ", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. And then second question, just related to the write-down in Canada, is are going to be incremental amortization expense that we have to start plugging into Canada each year now based on the way you're going to amortize the brand there? ", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. So that's correct, Bryan. Having moved the brands amortizing them over 30 to 50 years will give us a full-year cost of about $40 million on the full-year. Obviously that's a non-cash cost so it doesn't affect our cash flow number, but it will flow through on our earnings line. So that's correct and pretty standard in these situations. ", "Dave Dunnewald", "And just so people know this is Dave Dunnewald, that started in the fourth quarter so you'll see three quarters of that impact kind of on an overlap basis in 2017. ", "Tracey Joubert", "So about $30,000,000.2017, $40 million on a full-year basis. ", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. And then the last one, I noticed on your website if got the pro forma updates through the fourth quarter. So I'm assuming is that what we should be using out to sort of adjuster models, the base for our models to model of 2017? ", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. That's correct. We tried -- a few people have talked about quarter we tried very hard to make this really clear and consistent. Using the pro forma I think it's everybody can have the best view of our business on a like for like basis. Think one thing just to mention is one of the made from the previous set of pro forma's related to really more detail planning on the PP are depreciation number is actually increased so that given us about $0.07 in the fourth quarter. So just as you look at the previous set of performance the new set of performance one of the numbers you may not have spotted is the depreciation number is bigger because the more exacting analysis of how we're allocating some of the asset values and life's and our business in the fourth quarter this out $0.07 difference to probably what you were expecting. ", "Bryan Spillane", "And it looks like it's also there some adjustments to the prior quarter also from what I saw on that line? ", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. That's correct so we flowed that all the way back see if got full-year 20, full-year 2016 but there was a chunk in the fourth quarter in 2016 so just look out for that as you do your analysis and then just one last one I guess is we're talking about the pro forma.", "Bryan Spillane", "Is there anything else that's different today versus that November 1 set of pro formas besides the depreciation? ", "Tracey Joubert ", "Yes so Bryan there was another driver and that related to a pension amortization. So once we sort of got down through the interpretation of our performer guidance we actually removed a pro forma adjustment that we had in that pro forma back in November. And it also related to purchase accounting impacts so the tailwind going into 2017 for that reference around $30 million. And just another item is that the Miller global brands are not in the pro forma. ", "Bryan Spillane", "All right. So as we're looking at bridging from pro forma to next year there's that $30 million that shouldn't repeat next year and then whatever we were thinking about in terms of the Miller global brands? ", "Tracey Joubert", "That's right. ", "Mark Hunter", "Plus the full-year amortization related to the Canada impairment, that's correct. ", "Bryan Spillane", "And obviously the $50 million pension is the other one that hopefully won't recur? ", "Mark Hunter", "Provision, yes. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic of SIG. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is actually [indiscernible] on for Pablo. Two quick questions. One I think you made of touched on already. The new $550 million worth of cost savings energy guidance how much cannot be attributed to MillerCoors itself, for a man dollars a century? And then secondly the pro forma EBIT ex-items was up for a $27 million trend for 2016 for disclosure. How much of that could be attributed to the deal? ", "Mark Hunter", "Sorry the line is a little bit tricky can you just repeat the second part? ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. The pro forma EBIT for MillerCoors was up $170 million term for 2016 can you just tell us how much of that can be attributed to the deal? ", "Mark Hunter", "All right let me take the two questions one at a time. Tracy you want to take the second question, on the first question that is three-year guidance and acronym in a split in about by business unit we're reporting on an enterprise-level and we'll update on an ongoing basis. We have set a target of $175 million as we go through 2017 and as I said earlier we try and meet or beat those numbers as we always anticipate that we're not breaking out cost savings by business unit. On the second question which relates to the 2016 performance I think Dave Dunnewald. ", "Dave Dunnewald", "Let me pick up that one. It sounds as are you looking essentially for an earnings accretion or what was the deal that affect. You will see that pro forma number we've done anything we can to make those as comparable as possible for the adjustments in 2015 and 2016 are substantially the same. You want to see the deal benefit either just looking at the more actual results to be posted for the fourth quarter and comparing that with the archers as we've had in our prior year quarter. That's going to do your best estimate at this point but we're going to actually do call it full math around the that will give you a general idea and you can see that on the EBITDA tables in the earnings release and the other let's call it pretax earnings tables look at the actual number. ", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the Q4 so this concludes our question-and-answer session and I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Mark Hunter for closing remarks. ", "Mark Hunter", "Angela, that sounded almost like we choreographed that there. So many thanks for joining our call this morning and for your continued interest in the Molson Coors Brewing Company.

Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results that the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Thank you, and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. And many thanks for taking the time to join us today. With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Gavin Hattersley, our CFO; Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, our CEO for European business; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, VP of Investor Relations; and we also have Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors, joining us today.", "Now as you know, a few months ago, we announced Tom's plan to retire at the end of June, and I'd like to take this opportunity to both recognize Tom's contribution since joining the U.S.A. business and in particular, his leadership since being appointed as MillerCoors CEO around 4 years ago. So many thanks for your leadership and we wish you well, albeit you still have a full agenda through to the end of June.", "Now while we are well into the search, we do not anticipate that we will have Tom's successor in place by the end of next month. As a result, the MillerCoors board has asked their own, Gavin Hattersley, to step in on an interim basis to lead the MillerCoors team while we complete the search for Tom's replacement. Gavin is an outstanding and trusted leader with ideal qualifications for the role. His extensive beer industry knowledge and experience in the U.S. and on the global stage, along with his unique experience of having held top leadership positions with both parent companies and MillerCoors, and this makes him the right choice to take the business forward with integrity and a strong sense of purpose. Equally important, Gavin is not leaving MillerCoors, as he will continue in his CFO role here as well.", "So with that, let's talk about our quarterly performance. Our results for the first quarter reflect continued volume pressure in our largest markets and, as expected, a significant impact from foreign currency movements, a higher tax rate and terminations of business contracts, all of which we discussed on our last earnings call. Now despite this backdrop, we remain absolutely resolute in our focus on building our brand strength, achieving positive pricing, transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, improving commercial execution and embedding Profit After Capital Charge throughout our organization.", "Our first quarter performance headwinds are as follows: our net sales per hectoliter increased 1.8% in constant currency, driven by strong global pricing and revenue management initiatives. Constant currency net sales decreased 3% due to lower volume in Europe and Canada, and by adding an additional effect of foreign currency, reported net sales declined 14.2%. We grew Coors Light volume 0.6% globally, driven by double-digit growth outside of the U.S. and Canada. Our global strategic trust portfolio grew volume mid-single-digit rate in the quarter.", "Worldwide volume declined 3.5%, driven by Europe, Canada and the U.S. Underlying pretax income on a constant currency basis increased 0.6%, driven by positive net pricing, along with results of cost-saving initiatives. The underlying performance of the business was stronger than this result indicates, as we cycled a particularly strong quarter last year when pretax income nearly doubled.", "Including the effect of unfavorable currency, underlying pretax earnings declined 4.2% on a reported basis. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $228.6 million, a 9% decrease from a year ago partially due to foreign currency movements. Underlying after-tax income decreased 15.8%, with nearly all of this driven by unfavorable foreign currency and a higher tax rate that was cycling a large discrete tax benefit a year ago. Our board approved a double-digit percentage increase in our quarterly dividend and a new stock repurchase program in the first quarter. And we began to implement this new buyback program with $50 million of cash used early in the second quarter for Class B common stock repurchases.", "We also completed the Mount Shivalik Breweries acquisition last month in India. This bolt-on acquisition gives us strong leadership positions in 3 states in India, 1 of the fastest-growing beer markets in the world. It also adds a strong regional fundable brands to our portfolio and gives us a platform to expand our international brands in these states.", "Now in terms of regional highlights, U.S. underlying earnings increased 5% due to higher pricing, positive sales mix and strong cost control. Volume was lower in the weak first quarter for the U.S. beer industry. We continue to grow our largest Above Premium brands while also making strides towards restoring growth to our Premium Light brands. Coors Light declined, but improved its trend versus last year. Miller Lite, again, its grew share of the Premium Light segment and Coors Banquet continue to grow volume and share. In Above Premium, Blue Moon grew at mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, while Leinenkugel increased at high single-digit rates, and both Redd's and Smith & Forge Cider achieved strong double-digit growth.", "In Canada, underlying earnings declined 12.5%, driven almost entirely by unfavorable foreign currency and the impact of terminating our Modelo joint venture a year ago. Canada sales-to-retail or STRs declined 3.7%, with nearly 1/3 of this decline due to the loss of the Modelo brands. In Coors brands, the Coors Light sales trend improved versus last year, benefiting from more retail programming and new advertising. The combined Coors brand family grew Canada market share, partially due to the addition of Coors Altitude. In Above Premium, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth in the first quarter, as did Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider, and we delivered mid single-digit growth from our Creemore and Granville Island Craft brands.", "Our Europe business faced weak consumer demand in some of our higher revenue and profit markets, and an industry mix, volume mix shift to the Economy segment, and we deliberately chose to pursue value ahead of volume. Our first quarter result reflect positive pricing in most of our Europe markets, also lower volume and negative sales mix. These factors, along with the loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K. in 2015 contributed to lower volume and market share in Europe in the first quarter. Nonetheless, we maintained our focus on building our core brands and Above Premium portfolio, including Crafts, as well as revenue management and price discipline across the region. The Craft and Above Premium brands performed well, with Coors Light, Doom Bar and Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic growing strongly.", "Our International business delivered double-digit growth in volume in the first quarter with continued momentum from Coors Light in Latin America and strong double digit volume growth in India. Due to unfavorable foreign currency movements and increased marketing investments, our loss for the quarter increased by $2.4 million.", "Now I'll turn over to Gavin to give additional first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the rest of 2015. Gavin?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Thanks, Mark, and hello, everybody. Underlying free cash flow for the first quarter of 2015 totaled a cash use of $162.2 million. This represented $97.6 million more cash used versus a year ago and was driven by lower net income and a decreased benefit from working capital timing, including higher cash paid for taxes. Our underlying free cash flow result in the first quarter excludes a $227.1 million discretionary contributions to our U.K. pension plan earlier this year. Net free cash used in the first quarter of the year is normal in this seasonal business, but this is the lowest and cash generating part of the year. Our first quarter free cash flow included the following factors: $202.6 million of negative operating cash flow and $221.6 million of net add-backs for the discretionary pension contribution minus the cash impact of special items. Invested cash outflows included $73.7 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $310.4 million of cash distributions and $417.9 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.", "The detailed reconciliation of our first quarter underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release distributed this morning.", "Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.251 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $317.6 million resulting in net debt of $2.934 billion, which is $521.4 million lower than a year ago. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results for the quarter.", "Looking forward to the balance of 2015, we are lowering our full year outlook for capital spending to approximately $300 million, down from $330 million provided on our last earnings call. This improvement is driven primarily by continued weakness of various currencies versus the U.S. dollar, coupled with value engineering of some planned capital projects after running them through our PACC model. All other full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter, such that our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $550 million, plus or minus 10%, at April 30th's foreign currency rates. We expect cash contributions to either fund benefit plans to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million in 2015, including our 42% of MillerCoors' contributions. We anticipate 2015 pension expense of approximately $27 million. We expect our 2015 MG&A expense and Corporate to be approximately $110 million. Our consolidated net interest expense to be approximately $120 million, which is based on FX rates and hedging positions at the end of the first quarter and our 2015 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%. After this year, we expect our underlying tax rate to be near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% for the next few years, assuming no further changes in tax loss, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "In 2015 cost outlook, we continue to expect MillerCoors's cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in the low single-digit rate for the full year and International business cost of goods sold to decrease in the low double-digit range per hectoliter. In local currency, we still expect Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in the mid-single-digit rate and Europe to decrease in the mid-single-digit rate. And finally, regarding the profit and cash headwind from foreign currency that we expect this year, we would apply foreign exchange rates at the end of April to our results for the last 3 quarters of 2014. It would reduce our underlying pretax earnings for that period by more than $50 million, and the impact on cash would be even larger. If we add the $5.1 million of FX impacting the first quarter this year as set out in our earnings release, our full year FX estimated impact will be more than $55 million or approximately 6-point -- 6% to 7% on consolidated results. We have taken steps in recent years to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposures by our debt structures and hedging.", "So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and Q&A. Mark?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Thanks, Gavin. As we discussed in our last earnings call, we continue to expect our 2015 results to be challenged by negative foreign currency, determination of 3 major business contracts and a higher effective tax rate. Additionally, our Canada results will be affected by new framework agreement that was announced by the Ontario government last month, although we expect much of the impact to be phased in over the next 4 years. We will continue to work with the government and our fellow beer store owners to implement the recommended changes.", "Despite these challenges, we will continue to drive our strategy of building a stronger brand portfolio, strengthening our core brand positions and increasing our share in Above Premium, Craft and Cider. We will have a relentless focus in delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the first choice brewer in the geographies and segments where we choose to play and we will selectively build our international brands and strengthen our world-class commercial capability. We'll do this while ensuring we have a fit-for-purpose cost base and a deeply embedded discipline and PACC-led capital allocation process.", "Besides including PACC performance measures in our long-term incentive plan this year, we have been rolling out interactive training with each of the country teams to embed our value-driving PACC model from top to bottom in the organization.", "Regionally, in the U.S., we intend to lead the beer industry with innovations like Redd's and Smith & Forge Cider, with the latest expansions being Redd's Green Apple and Wicked Mango, and we'll introduce drinkers to new styles and flavors in our Craft portfolio with offerings like Blue Moon White IPA and Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy. We'll continue to bolster Miller Lite with a new national advertising campaign and we'll complete the total refresh of Coors Light that will expand across all consumer touch points that has started with new packaging that emphasizes as born in the Rockies heritage. The brand also dedicates new and national television advertising in March, designed to emphasize Coors Light's unique refreshment and we'll launch additional new television advertising in June.", "Last month, we also reintroduced the Summer line extension, Coors Light Citrus Radler with a new name and packaging. And finally, we'll continue to build first choice customer partnerships. Working with our distributors to bring more resources to the on-premise with our building with beer retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and the broad appeal of our American light lagers.", "In Canada, we continue to invest in our core brands and Above Premium, including Craft, imports and flavored malt beverages. In early March, Molson Canadian introduced the next chapter of its Beer Fridge campaign, and in April, launched an NHL promotion nationally. We also introduced a new advertising campaign behind Coors Light in early March.", "In Above Premium, consumer demand remains strong for Coors Banquet, Molson Canadian Cider and Mad Jack Apple Lager, which will be rolled out nationally in the second quarter after a successful launch in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec in 2014. The national launch of Coors Altitude is proceeding well, as is our expanded partnership for the marketing and distribution at the Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol, and Strongbow brands. We're also launching Rickard's Radler as a new seasonal offering for summer.", "In Europe, although some of our largest markets continue to be weak this year, our segment-leading core brands will receive incremental investments in local currency in the remainder of 2015. We also intend to continue the strong momentum of our Above Premium Craft and Cider portfolio, including expanding Carling British Cider to more European markets, introducing new Sharp's brands into the U.K. and adding the Modelo brands to our International Premium brand portfolio in Central Europe this year.", "We're also taking important steps in the first half of this year to ensure that our U.K. supply chain is fit-for-purpose, including entering into an agreement in January to sell our Burton Malting operations in the third quarter. And in March, purchasing the brewing and kegging operation of Thomas Hardy's Burtonwood brewery in the north of England, which will give us greater capability and flexibility to grow our U.K. Craft business further.", "Meanwhile, following the termination of our U.K. contract brewing arrangement with Heineken at the end of April, we're closing our Alton brewery this month in order to ensure that our supply chain capacity is aligned with the needs of the business. Our International business will focus on growth and expansion in new and existing markets. We'll continue to drive strong momentum on Coors Light and Coors 1873 in Latin America, along with growth in our India business. Our recent India acquisition is in line with our strategy to grow our regional brand portfolio and adds 2 breweries in 2 large Indian states and more than doubles our brewing capacity there. This acquisition gives us a powerful combination of industry-leading brewing expertise, brand reach and operational efficiency that will allow us to grow our brands even further in India, one of the fastest-growing beer markets globally.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In the U.S., through April 25, STRs decreased to a low single-digit rates. In Canada, through April 30, STRs were down low double digits. Excluding the Miller brands last year, our Canada STRs were down high single digits in part due to year over shift in the timing of Easter. In Europe, through April 30, sales volume is down mid-single-digits, partially driven by the loss of the Modelo brands in the U.K. this year and the timing of Easter. Our international sales volume including royalty volume increased at double-digit rate in April. Now as always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "To summarize our discussion today, Molson Coors results for the first quarter reflect a number of headwinds, but we remain resolute in our focus on building brand strength, achieving positive pricing, transforming our portfolio to the Above Premium segment, improving our commercial execution and embedding profit after capital charge in our organization and delivering total returns to our shareholders.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. And also, at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. Additionally, in the next 2 months, we hope to see many of you at 3 events. Firstly, Gavin will present at the Goldman Sachs Global Staple Summit in New York on Tuesday May 12. Secondly, we'll hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday June 3, at our brewery in Montr\u00e9al. And thirdly, we'll host our annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon of Wednesday, June 17.", "So at this point, if we could open up the lines for questions, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I want to talk a little bit about the COGS guidance here and if we look at the impact of transactional FX, it seems like it should be a negative in both Europe as well as Canada. So can you talk a little bit about the differential there in COGS guidance, given the much tougher COGS environment you're seeing in Canada versus Europe?", "Mark R. Hunter", "John, thanks for the question. I'll let Gavin pick that up.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "John, thanks. Look, I mean, the guidance we gave is in local currency. So the one that's directly in U.S. dollars is MCR. So from a Canada point of view, we've obviously got a lot of moving parts in Canada. We've got the growth in the import brands, which would be Coors Banquet, Heineken and FEMSA, and we've also got a lot of really nice innovation going on there, plus there's the changes of the termination of the Corona contract. And in Europe, we've got brand mix going on there with no Corona, well, that's coming out and we've got the lowest contract brewing volume as well. And from an MCR point of view, it's mostly geographic and PACC mix changes between the vast number of territories in which we operate. All of that is offset to a degree by our cost savings programs, which we've got in place.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So it sounds like the way we should think about this is at least with Canada, it's actually positive mix from higher-priced products that's driving the piece of that as opposed to, let's say, underlying cost increases?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Well, there are underlying cost increases as well in there, John, yes, but growth in import brands...", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Not just that?", "Mark R. Hunter", "It's not just that, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. First, in Europe, you'd mentioned -- there's a mention of a decision not to chase profitable volume or unprofitable volume in the press release. Could you just touch on a little bit the promotional environment? From what I understood, it become much more promotional in the U.K. in the first quarter, so just some more color there, please?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Bryan, thanks for the question. I'll ask Simon to pick up some of the detail. I mean, just a couple of context points. Firstly, we've started seeing a couple of markets shift into the Economy segment as consumers make choices about where their constrained disposable income is going to be used. So that's just one dynamic that started to emerge and the team are cognizant of and are obviously reacting to. And to your second point, from a promotional perspective, there's no real new news there, I mean, the European market remains competitive. But Simon, do you want to give a little bit more color to specifically what's happening?", "Simon Cox", "Yes, Mark. I think, you've covered the headlines. Thanks for the question, Bryan. As Mark said, there is some move driven, I think, by the consumers being economically challenged, particularly in some of the markets post the flood. There is some move towards the economy and value segment in some of our markets. We've chosen not to play aggressively in those parts of the market. And to your question on the U.K, this is always fairly volatile in terms of promotion intensity, but Q1 has been, I would say, a little bit more intense on the promotional lines in the -- particularly in the multiple growth channel. And again, we've chosen not to participate in some of those more aggressive deals, so that's really what we're referencing when we made the headline results.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just one other question on the Alton brewery. Can you quantify at all how much that will contribute or how much savings you might be able to generate this year from that?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Brian, we haven't gone -- we haven't given a specific number on that yet now.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. But fair to think that it will be some sort of positive offset or positive contribution this year?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Bryan, yes, it will be a positive contribution, but I'd point you back to our guidance that we have of $40 million to $60 million worth of cost savings in this financial year. We obviously have a lot of moving parts, things that move around, so that guidance has remained unchanged.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So in the earlier MillerCoors call, we got a little bit color from Tom just in terms of the MillerCoors board's decision on Gavin's appointment as an interim CEO. So maybe, Mark, just kind of share your perspective on the process and the rationale for having Gavin as an interim CEO? And then, just in terms of his responsibility in managing sort of the both roles, how should we think about that and the potential for this becoming more of a permanent position over time? What are some of the things that you're focused on as you make that decision and really finding the permanent replacement?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Thanks, Judy. I think there was a multiple number of questions in your question there, I'll try and cover them all. I mean, to the most important thing, in terms of the decision around Gavin, it's because Gavin is absolutely the best person for the job and we're delighted that we're able to ask Gavin to step up and he's accepted to do that. I mean, that's some of the easiest part. In terms of the process, I mean, Tom indicated towards the end of last year his intention to retire and we publicly announced that earlier on this year ahead of our distributor convention. We've had a search process in place. And I think, from our Chairman, Pete, Alan Clark and myself, we are absolutely clear that we want to find the best possible leader for the MillerCoors organization, that's what the organization requires and deserves, and we will take our time and be thoughtful. As I'm sure you're aware, these type of searches sometimes take time. We're well into the process, but it's clear that by the end of June, it's unlikely we'll have a new full-time replacement or permanent replacement in place and we're in a privileged position with Gavin, someone who knows both of the shareholders well, has worked for both companies and has actually operated a very senior level within MillerCoors. So he'll hit the ground running. And whether Gavin is there for 1 month, 3 months or 6 months, he'll be leading that business to compete, play to win and win in the U.S. beer business. That's the agreement, and Alan and I are absolutely clear on that. So that's where we are and we'll keep everybody updated as the process develops over the coming weeks and months. Gavin is going to be busy in the meantime, so please try not to distract him.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And then, I guess, my second question is maybe just on the business and switching gears to Canada. Just the industry volume looks a little better in the first quarter. I think, it was up a little bit. Obviously, your share performance is still pretty soft there. The April trend, I know there's an Easter impact, seems like that the volume was pretty weak. So just some broad perspective on kind of what are you seeing in terms of the industry perspective and your effort to really put your market share position in a better footing, how much traction are you getting there? Do you think there's more spending that really needs to go to drive that? Just some color there would be helpful.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Yes. So Judy, I'll ask Stewart to talk in a little bit more detail shortly. Let me just give you kind of a couple of headlines. I mean, Stewart and the team are in the middle of a very significant transformation of our business in Canada in terms of total restructuring of our supply chain, a big cost down program and ensuring that our portfolio is fit for future. From a Canada perspective, in the first quarter, I was personally pleased with the progress Stewart and the team made on pricing. The Coors Light trends improved versus 2014 that we saw strong growth in Coors Banquet and with our Above Premium portfolio, and we've been encouraged by share growth position in both Alberta and Qu\u00e9bec, which are critical markets for us. Headline level, I would say, overall, we're disappointed with our total performance and we'll certainly ensure far more effective and ruthless execution of our plans in the balance of the year. Take it from me, we'll be running even harder and faster in Canada. We've got a great set of plans and it's very much about the quality of execution of those plans for the balance of the year to build on some of the strong points that are emerging in our Canadian business. But Stewart, do you want to just jump a little bit deeper into some of the detail in Canada, as per Judy's question?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, not a lot I can add to it. I mean, Judy, I think that the quarter was a bit better for the beer industry, no question about it. The shift, I think, from Easter from Q2 into Q1 was absolutely a help. If you look at the marketplace, the market trends were not dissimilar to what we saw last quarter in the sense that the West was much stronger than the East. And so part of our underperformance came from geographic mix. Part of it came from cycling the big promotion of Molson Canadian around the Winter Olympics last year and part of it came from just underperformance. On the underperformance side, we've got a very clear view on what's driving that and we're working very aggressively to change those things. Probably, there's also worth mentioning, just looking at the big picture of things, our goal is to grow share and our goal is to grow the profit. And we've been focusing against this strategy of overhauling the portfolio, driving our cost base down and improving our executional capabilities, and I think we've made good progress on all of those, as Mark commented. If you look back at last year, we saw improving share trends for the first 3 quarters of last year and the last 2 quarters have been more challenged. But as I say, I think, we've got a clear line on where the underperformance is coming from and we'll be working to address that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Financial.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple of questions. One is just a more technical one. In the U.S., when you gave us that April update, is it fair to think that the Easter shift hurt April, so to speak, the way it hurt in Canada?", "Mark R. Hunter", "I believe that's the case, yes, Mark.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, you've caught on India for a while now. You have a nice tuck-in there, but when you think about the longer-term opportunity and how you as a company are going to approach that, can you just think -- share with us a little more, Mark, about your thinking on the role of capital, size capital as opposed to these tuck-in and more organic approaches to unlocking that opportunity over a multiyear period?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Yes, I mean, I'll give you a little bit of context and I'll ask Kandy to talk specifically about the opportunity that we see in India. But I think, I've been pretty clear that as we look at building our international brands, really along the double act of the Coors trademark in Staropramen, we're looking to drive that business principally on a license and export model with exception of a couple of markets where we believe that we can invest really for the medium to long-term, and India fits really nicely there. I think, we did our apprenticeship in India through our initial foray into the country, and we see a very clear path to strong position across these states. And when you think about the population in these states, across the 3 of them, we're talking 150 million to 200 million people. So these are big markets with real long-term potential, so we'll be selective with our international cash investments, as I say, principally on a license and export model, with a small number of markets where we can see long-term growth potential. On India itself, Kandy, do you want to just give a little bit more color to where we are in the marketplace?", "Krishnan Anand", "Sure. Thanks, Mark. As building on what Mark said, we see India as an attractive, long-term market. It's currently at market size of 23 million to 24 million hectoliters. It's been growing double digits steadily. And yet, per capita consumption of beer is only 2 liters per person per year, which means, in the long-term, we expect this market to continue to grow. Our strategy in India has been taking positions and attractive steps and building our position, the leadership positions within those steps. With that in our first FDR [ph] which has worked out successfully with the recent acquisition, we have -- I believe, you do that in 2 other steps, so we start with leading positions. And our strategy would be to be successful in these states and roll at a steady pace that we can continue to drive that strategy versus the Pan-India strategy. Specifically, within that, we have local brands, so this acquisition gives us a brand called Thunderbolt, which is a very strong brand, and it also gives us a platform to build our global brands on top of these regional brands, and that's broadly speaking our strategy in India.", "Mark R. Hunter", "I mean, obviously, any investment in any of our international markets goes through our PACC model and we will be very judicial in our use of cash as per the framework that, I think, we've described on a very consistent basis. We're certainly very excited about the medium to long-term potential around the geographical platform we've now given ourselves in India.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "That's great. And on that, Mark, that's good to hear, and I've got confidence in that. We all know the history of Brazil and China, so that's kind of what's driving my questions about India, but PACC and the approach you're taking, I think, is different. One last one is it pertains to Gavin's appointment and just all of us trying to better understand what's going on here? And I proposed on the earlier call that you would have a bias for an internal candidate. By internal, I mean, someone within the larger SABMiller and Molson Coors system as opposed to someone within the broader beer industry. And of course, Gavin's appointment kind of is consistent with that, but is that a fair understanding of how you're approaching this? Is that a fair understanding of who's coming to you, so to speak? Are you seeing much interest from outside of those 2 companies? I'm just trying understand, trying to get a read on where this is ultimately going to go? And then, the second question is, SAB is the majority owner here, but you have some special rights because of the nature of the situation, I think, contractually. So can you just give us a flavor about how that dialogue works with SAB in terms of ultimately choosing the person to be the permanent CEO?", "Mark R. Hunter", "I mean, to take the second part of your question first, we have a 50-50 governance model within MillerCoors, so the board is constructed with equal directors from both SAB and from Molson Coors. And it's fair to say, I think, Alan Clark and myself are absolutely aligned on what we need to get done in the U.S. business. We both harbor the same ambition to build a winning beer business in the U.S., and we both hold the intent of ensuring that we have a great leader to lead the MillerCoors organization. We are looking broadly for a new leader. I don't want to get into the detail of the process, the process is well underway. And I think people are just going to have to be patient. I mean, asking an executive from one of the shareholders to step in and run one of the businesses is not unusual in any organization, so I don't think we're doing anything unusual in it. I would really encourage people not to read anything beyond the headlines into this. We have an interim requirement. We have an interim solution and the process for a permanent leader continues.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And next question is from Rob Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "Can you remind us what your target date was again in terms of having the International business go to breakeven and whether you think you're still on target with that given current results and the evolving strategy in India?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Let me pick that up. So what we said was as we moved towards the end of 2016, we expect our International business to be at least a breakeven if not in profit. We still believe that we will deliver that when you put to one side impact of FX that's clearly impacted the business since we made that statement back at the end of 2013. We expect the FX impact relative to our plan at that point in time to affect us by mid to high single-digit, millions of dollars. So when you include that, it will make it challenging to get to breakeven. When you exclude that impact of FX, we're still very confident that we'll get to breakeven, FX excluded.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "Terrific. And then, not to kind of go back to Canada again, and I don't want to overdo it, but can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment there, pricing and whether SAB's entrance in April looks disruptive?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Okay. Stewart, would you like to pick that up and...", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, happy to address that. So first of all, let me work backwards. I mean, SAB's entry into the market has been in the last 30 days, so nothing I can really comment on there. I think, we've got a terrific portfolio and we're able to -- we'll be able to address all comers. In terms of competition in the marketplace, I mean, it is a competitive beer market, certainly, more and more brewers as the market and the cross base grows, but I don't think that anything has changed in that over the last quarter. Relative to your question around pricing, pricing was, I would say, broadly in line with inflation across the country. The amounts in excess of that I would put down to mix as both the Above Premium import and the Above Premium domestic segments of the market grew. More specifically than that, I would say pricing was weakest in Qu\u00e9bec and strongest between -- strongest in Ontario and the West.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ian Shackleton from Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just going back onto Canada again, perhaps you can just talk a little bit on how the beer framework changes in Ontario, what that actually means? And my view is obviously building a solid morale is probably a good thing. Do you potentially lose some control of that, which may not be such a good thing. Is that a simple view?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, I'm not sure, really. That is true only in that beer stores will continue to operate and will continue to be run by our board as it is today and they will continue to exist in a format that provides opportunities for any brewers to get their beer to markets. So in that sense, I don't think anything changes. As you will have read, there are a lot of changes that are coming to Ontario, but there's not a lot I can add to what has already been announced publicly.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And I think, it was mentioned in the call about a 4-year period. I thought 2017 was the important year, but could you just explain why 4 years is important?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. So a couple of things, so maybe mixing 2 things there. On the pricing side, the province has instituted some restrictions on pricing for a period that ends in 2017, but the beer tax, which at the beginning of the process looked like it could all come in 1 year, will be phased in over 4 years.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Right. So that's the 4 years. Yes. Understood.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "They bring that in 25% a year.", "Mark R. Hunter", "And Ian, just to be clear, that 4-year period begins November of this year, so really think about '16, '17, '18 and '19 as the 4-year periods.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just as a follow-up. I mean, in that Canada price mix, the plus 3.8% is probably the best that we've seen for a very long time, I think, you have talked a little bit about some of the factors, but is that really sustainable? And I just wanted to -- to what extent, the Heineken brands, the extension of the Heineken brand is helping that?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, I don't think the Heineken brands have dramatically changed our NSR mix. I mean, we brought other Heineken brands on board, they tend to be much smaller, but just to give you a sense of the split. When you look at that 3.8%, about 2/3 was driven by net price and the remainder was from mix.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in queue. Mr. Hunter, do you have any closing remarks?", "Mark R. Hunter", "I do. Thank you. I'd just like to thank everybody for joining us today and for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. We look forward as a senior team to meet with many of you in New York on June 17. And just finally, best wishes again to Tom and also to Gavin as we work our way through this transition. Thanks for your interest this morning and see you soon.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Hello, and welcome everybody. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Fourth Quarter 2012 Follow-Up Earnings Conference Call.", "Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Peter Swinburn, Gavin Hattersley and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.", "So let's get started. With me on the call are Heather Pollard, Investor Relations Manager; Spencer Schurr, Finance Forecasting Manager; Eric Mickelson,  [ph] Manager of SEC Reporting; Mark Saks, Senior Director of Tax; and Zahir Ibrahim, Global Controller.", "Now as Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, lower fourth quarter underlying earnings were driven by a higher tax rate and cycling strong quarterly results the year before, including the 53rd week in our fiscal 2011 and some other onetime factors.", "Full year results included higher underlying earnings and $865 million of underlying free cash flow generation. Our Central Europe business is being integrated very effectively and in a difficult retail environment and isn't performing very well.", "In 2013, our focus will continue to be on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy and particularly, the first one, which is to grow profitably in our core businesses through brands and innovation. We also intend to pay down debt. In combination with disciplined high return cash use, our growth strategy is designed to drive long-term profit and cash flow and total return for our shareholders.", "So with that, we'd now like to open it up for your questions. Over to you, Candace.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.", "Operator", "We'll move to our next question. Your next question comes from Ian Shackleton from Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just a few questions. You gave us earlier some cost per hectoliter guidance, and I guess the one that was slightly higher was Canada. I was just sort of thinking that threw a little bit, is that really a comment on sort of pack mix really? And I know you have this move towards cans from returnable bottles? Is that the major factor there?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. So our cost of goods guidance in Canada was mid-single digits for the year. That does include a component of innovation and also -- and that does include the Aluminum Pint bottle, which we plan to roll out this year. We -- it also includes some high end or, call it, top of the category introductions as well.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Perhaps just a follow-up here. In terms of sort of talking about further or giving some guidance on further cost savings, I think it was Peter implied that you might be able to come back with Q1 in terms of the Central Europe-U.K. management merger. Is that realistic, we should expect something then? And I guess, we were thinking more about getting news on the Investor Day in June on such things?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, I think Peter mentioned something about our New York Investor Day that we would have more information on our cost savings programs. And that's really when we plan to, as you say, provide a bit more texture around that.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So not with Q1, it's going to be in June really when we get that?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, that's right. The meeting this year is in June. The reason we moved it out is so that we'd have more specifics we can provide you around peak season programming. For example, we had feedback that if we moved it from March to sometime around May or June, we could show more of the peak season advertising and retail promotions and those types of things. So that's why the timing change this year and along with that comes kind of the strategic view, including things like cost reductions.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And just final question for me. Obviously, you're indicating the low tax rate of 20% could last a few more years. And it's a difficult thing for us to analyze. Is there any way you could sort of help us as to what is really helping hold that down a bit longer than perhaps was expected?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, actually, we've been expecting it to take us a few years to get to our long-term tax rate. We've been -- that expectation is not new. It's been going -- we've been providing that kind of, call it, texture around the long-term rate for over a year, maybe 1.5 years. So that's not new. What is new is the level of the long-term tax rate, which did move down with the Central Europe acquisition. And then the individual annual tax rates have been lowered because of onetime benefits, certainly in 2012 and as I recall also in 2011, we had some onetime tax benefits that we did not expect to continue. And that's another reason that we were in those specific years below the long-term tax rate.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And I don't know if you're able to define a few years, but it sounds like this is certainly 3 or 4 years, but probably not 10, 15 years.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, in my vernacular, a few tends to be 3 to 5. And so yes, we're not talking 10 years here. We're just talking kind of a moderate progression over, as I say, 3 to 5 years. Oh and by the way, that progression -- sorry, just to be sure, to be clear, Ian, the progression to get to the long-term tax rate, we say -- we suggest that, that's gradual. That would be assuming that there are no additional changes in tax laws or other onetime types of events. As we did actually see in the fourth quarter with the change in the Serbian tax rate.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have another question from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Well, David, there's nobody else. I've got a few more actually as well. Obviously, the CapEx that you've raised for -- give us guidance for FY '13. Now on my calculation that is still running a reasonable amount ahead of depreciation. I guess, really trying to think a bit further forward, I mean, should we expect it to be moving more towards depreciation then again in a couple of years' time?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, the CapEx -- we're not going to provide forward guidance on that. But as you know, broadly speaking, CapEx and depreciation will tend to align over time just by their very nature. The amortization piece may or may not. But anyway, I guess, I won't provide specific guidance. But I guess, you probably understand the philosophical interaction between the two.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Sure. No, just really so it's going to track in the 3 30 really, I mean, obviously we've just bought Central Europe. There's clearly probably some things you're doing as a bit of a one-off. I just want to get a bit of a sense of should we really be using 3 30 as a base going forward, or is it a little bit of a one-off because of that first-time element?", "David Dunnewald", "Based on some of the capital activity that we had in 2012, specifically the, what we call, master plan in the U.K. where we have some ROI projects in, call it, the brewing footprint there. That's a bit higher than it might normally be. I can't really predict for you or forecast for you what we will need to do in the years ahead. But I would say that those are increasing, for example, the CapEx run rate in the last 12 months. And we're not done with that yet in the U.K. And then in Central Europe, yes, I would say that we do have a bit of extra capital that we need to put in from a systems standpoint in the Central Europe business as well in the near term.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just another one, on the international side. Peter obviously indicated that we should be expecting the loss to be coming down this year. Just remind me, do you have actually a target for getting to breakeven? Is there a date by which you are targeting that?", "David Dunnewald", "We're not providing a specific target date. What we are saying is that the business, currently, is in investment mode. And the fourth quarter profit notwithstanding, those businesses are still in investment mode. And at the same time, though, the strategy is to grow the top line faster than the rate of investment because we've been investing extra dollars behind the brands in those markets, relatively little in bricks and mortar. And as we grow the top line faster than the investment rate, then our intent is to bring those businesses to profitability over the medium term. But we'll see what that looks like.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just to be clear, medium term is different to near term that we were defining earlier on?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. What I don't want to -- when I say medium term, I just mainly don't want you to come away with the impression that it's short term, which generally is considered in a year. And so we're not talking about that sort of time frame.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to our presenters.", "David Dunnewald", "Okay. Great, thank you, Candace. In closing, I'd like to thank you, all, for your interest in Molson Coors and for joining us today. If you have additional questions that we did not cover during our time this afternoon, please call me on my direct line or at the main number here at Molson Coors, which is (303)927-BEER or 927-2337.

Later, we will conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time.  (Operator Instructions)  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Peter Swinburn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors Brewing. ", "Peter Swinburn ", "With me on the call are Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors\u2019 CFO, Leo Kiely, CEO of Miller Coors, Gavin Hattersley, CFO of Miller Coors, Kevin Boyce, CEO of Molson Canada, Mark Hunter, CEO of Coors Brewers Limited, Dave Perkins, President of Global Brand and Market Development, Sam Walker, Molson Coors\u2019 Chief Legal Officer, Bill Waters, Molson Coors\u2019 Controller and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors\u2019 Vice President of Investor Relations.", "On the call today Stewart and I will take you through some highlights of our fourth quarter 2008 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some initial perspective on 2009.  As usual, we will include a review of financial results for MillerCoors and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.  ", "So, our fourth quarter financial results reflect the combined challenges of a much stronger US dollar versus a year ago, substantial commodity inflation and volume softness in our major markets.  Foreign currency movements alone accounted for more than 55% of the year-over-year decline in fourth quarter pre-tax profit.  Input inflation across all of our businesses added another $41 million of headwinds in the quarter and beer volume declined from a year ago due to softening industry conditions in each of our major markets.", "While this was a difficult quarter, we continued to make operational progress across our company.  In Canada we grew net pricing based on the strength of our strategic brand portfolio despite continued competitive price discounting in Quebec.  In the UK we also grew net pricing for the eighth consecutive quarter and began to see significant benefits from the launch of Magners draught cider and our new contract brewing arrangement.", "MillerCoors in the US made great progress with its integration including reporting 22% growth in underlying earnings for the first two quarters of combined financial results versus the pro forma result a year ago.  MillerCoors has also announced that it is accelerating delivery of cost synergies during its first three years.  Finally, we reduced corporate overhead and interest costs in the fourth quarter.  ", "Before we go on to the fourth quarter in detail, I want to share with you some important accomplishments from 2008, a year full of challenges but also transformation and progress for our company.  We made great strides on brand building, front line pricing and cost reductions but, we gave back a lot to commodity inflation, weakened industry volume in key markets and unfavorable foreign currency towards the end of the year.", "On the bottom line, we reported underlying earnings of $512.6 million US dollars, up 1% from a year ago while earnings per share declined $0.04 to $2.76.  The completion of MillerCoors in the US led our transformational moves and integration is progressing well.  In Canada we increased net pricing based on the strength of our strategic brand portfolio and secured the opportunity to grow the Modelo brands across Canada for the long term.", "In the UK, we grew market share for the full year in both on and off premise with both Carling and Coors Light outperforming the market in their respective segments.  We also increased net pricing in all four quarters.  We launched Magners draught cider and setup a contract brewing arrangement that will be beneficial to us for years to come.  ", "Globally, we grew Coors Light volume 86% for the full year in 2008 and we exceeded all of our cost saving goals, significantly funded our pensions and reduced the future size and volatility of our pension liabilities.  We created a stronger global market development organization for future growth in the business and we reduced interest and corporate overhead expense.  All of these steps to put our company on a firmer footing as we move in to 2009.", "With that overview, I\u2019ll now turn it over to Stewart to review fourth quarter financial results and trends and then we\u2019ll cover the outlook for 2009.  ", "Stewart Glendinning ", "I\u2019ll start with the fourth quarter financial highlights.  Worldwide pro forma beer volume declined 4.2% from a year ago driven by industry weakness in each of our major markets.  Our underlying pre-tax income decreased 23.1% to $136.3 million.  As Peter mentioned, most of this decline was due to unfavorable foreign currency with the balance caused by a combination of weak industry volumes in key markets and continuing commodity inflation.  ", "Foreign currency movements decreased this pre-tax profit by approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter driven by a 19% year-over-year depreciation of the Canadian Dollar and a 23% depreciation of the British Pound versus the US dollar.  On the bottom line the underlying after tax income of $105.1 million or $0.57 per diluted share was 21% lower than the fourth quarter a year ago.", "It is important to note that our fourth quarter underlying earnings exclude some one-time expenses particularly related to MillerCoors and our Foster\u2019s cash settled total return swap as well as a net special credit of $2.1 million.  These adjustments to our US GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning.  Also, unless otherwise indicated all financial results we share with you today will be in US dollars.", "In segment performance highlights starting with Canada, our business faced strong headwinds from unfavorable foreign currency, continued cost inflation, slowing industry volume and competitive price discounting in Quebec.  These negative factors were partially offset by favorable net pricing as we implanted an additional price increase in most of Canada in the fourth quarter.  ", "To provide more comparable results, as I discuss Canada performance I will provide year-over-year changes that exclude the reporting effects of discontinuing our Foster\u2019s US contract earlier in the fourth quarter of 2007 and of setting up the Modelo Molson joint venture and the MillerCoors joint venture in 2008.  ", "So, let\u2019s review the highlights.  Canada underlying pre-tax income was $99.8 million in the fourth quarter, 23% lower than a year ago.  The weakening Canadian dollar reduced Canada segment underlying income by approximately $18 million in the quarter.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency movements, Canada underlying pre-tax income in local currency was 5% lower than a year ago.  ", "Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the fourth calendar quarter ended December 31st decreased .6% on a comparable basis versus a year ago as industry growth slowed in the fourth quarter.  This reduction also reflects our decision not to fully participate in off premise price discounting in Quebec in the fourth quarter.  Low single digit growth of Molson\u2019s strategic brands which represent more than 85% of our Canada STRs was offset by lower sales of our non-supported brands.", "Strategic brand growth was fueled by double digit growth of Coors Light and continued strong growth by Carling and Creemore.  Comparable partner import brand volumes increased at a low single digit rate.  Molson Canadian volume declined at a mid single digit rate compared to the prior year.  Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail grew and estimated .5% in the calendar fourth quarter.  This represented a deceleration versus earlier in 2008 and was driven by poorer weather, a softening economy and an acceleration of Quebec industry volume to the third quarter ahead of a fourth quarter price increase.", "On a comparable basis, our estimated Canada market share decreased less than one half share point in the fourth quarter versus a year ago.  Our Canada sales volume was 1.8 million barrels in the fourth quarter down 2.1% on a comparable basis versus prior year.  Comparable net sales per barrel increased 3.5% in local currency driven by 1.6% of favorable net pricing led by front line pricing in Quebec and Ontario, partially offset by extensive discounting in Quebec.", "The balance of the NSR growth in the quarter was due to sales mix shift including increased sales volume in our higher cost partner import brands.  Cost of goods sold per barrel in the fourth quarter increased 9.2% on a comparable basis in local currency.  ", "This underlying cost of goods increase was due to the net effect of three factors: first, higher commodity packaging material and other input cost drove a 6% increase combined with a 1.5% increase due to higher fuel and distribution costs; two, these inflationary increases were partially offset by 2% of savings from our resources for growth cost initiative; and three, finally an increase of about 3.5% was due to the ongoing shift in sales mix, Canada cost of goods sold per barrel reported in US dollars benefited from approximately $6 million in gains from currency forwards which offer a partial hedge of our Canadian dollar currency exposure.", "Comparable marketing general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 1.3% in local currency driven by higher pension and other overhead expenses.  Other income increased $4.5 million in the fourth quarter due to pre-tax gains from foreign currency hedges.  In the US underlying US segment pre-tax income decreased 21.2% to $56.2 million in the fourth quarter.  As a result of year-over-year timing differences in sales and marketing spending along with the impactive changes in accounting policies.", "Note that US segment results include our share of fourth quarter 2008 MillerCoors net income and various equity income adjustments which are then compared to the year earlier results reported by our legacy Coors business.  Looking specifically at the total MillerCoors P&L in US GAAP which is compared to the prior year pro forma MillerCoors results, underlying net income for the fourth quarter increased 16.5% to $135.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2008.", "This earnings growth was driven primarily by strong pricing and cost management which more than offset increases in commodity costs and a reduction in shipment volume.  MillerCoors increased net revenue and pricing drove strong underlying income for the fourth quarter.  MillerCoors domestic net sales per barrel which excludes contract brewing and company owned distributor sales, increased 8% versus the prior year driven by strong front line pricing, reductions in discounting and favorable mix.  ", "While our fourth quarter pricing actions fueled revenue growth, this in turn affected our overall volumes.  During the period, MillerCoors sales to retailer declined 2.3% reflecting an overall industry slowdown and lower sales of Miller Light as well as softness in premium and above premium brands.  Domestic sales to wholesalers dropped 4.3% driven largely by a reduction in distributor inventory levels and lower sales to retail.  ", "Cost of goods sold per barrel increased by 5.2% as savings from performance initiatives, [inaudible], and resources for growth and synergies were more than offset by increasing commodity costs.  Fourth quarter results were only minimally improved by significant recent commodity price reductions as materials were largely hedged through calendar year 2008 and 2009 prior to the reduction.  ", "Without going in to our hedging strategy, I can say savings from the commodity price drop will not be significant through 2009.  Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased by 6.1% to $514 million driven primarily by integration costs of $10 million and the higher spending on the launch of MGD 64, Coors Light Media and increased sales and tactical spending.", "Moving to our UK business in the fourth quarter, underlying income declined due to unfavorable foreign currency.  Underlying pre-tax income in local currency was essentially unchanged due to strong pricing growth.  The ramp up of our contract brewing arrangement and reduced marketing spending which offset the volume impact of a week industry, higher input cost inflation and higher pension and bad debt costs.", "Looking at fourth quarter highlights, underlying pre-tax income was $30.6 million was $23.6 million lower than a year ago.  This is a direct result of a 23% decline in the British Pound versus the US dollar which reduced underlying pre-tax income by approximately $9 million.  Our UK owned brand volume declined 9.4% year-on-year compared to a total industry decline of approximately 8.3% reflecting the impact of a weak economy in the UK.  ", "We grew share in the on premise channel in the quarter but we loss share in the off premise as we took a tougher pricing stance with customers which is the right strategy for our bottom line.  Comparable net sales per barrel of our owned products increased 10.4% in local currency, nearly two thirds driven by higher price in all channels as we implemented our second price rise of the year early in the fourth quarter.  The balance of the revenue per barrel increase was the result of a one-time reduction in volume related payments to customers and positive sales mix partially the result in growth in draft Magners cider.  ", "This represents the eight consecutive quarter of year-over-year pricing growth for our UK business.  In the fourth quarter pricing grew ahead of input inflation resulting in improved gross margins.  Comparable cost of goods sold per barrel sold of our owned products increased 6.8% in local currency in the fourth quarter primarily due to higher energy and materials cost inflation and higher pension expense partially offset by results of cost reduction initiatives.  ", "Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the UK increased 5.25 in local currency.  Marketing expense in the quarter decreased as we aligned spending with the trading environment.  General and administrative expense increased due to higher bad debt charges and higher pension expense.  ", "In the global markets in corporate segment, our corporate markets team continues to take a disciplined approach to building our brands in international markets such as China, Japan, Mexico and parts of Western Europe.  This operating strategy is built around taking Coors Light and other high potential brands on a very selective basis to markets around the global generally with a strong local distribution partner.  Our brands add value to the partners\u2019 portfolio and we leverage their capability and resources.  This helps to minimize our capital expenditure, allowing us to focus our investment on brand building rather than breweries and other infrastructure.  ", "Looking at the fourth quarter results, global markets grew volume nearly 20% driven by Coors Light in China and Western Europe.  MG&A totaled $33.5 million in the fourth including corporate general and administrative expense of $23.2 million which decreased $7.6 million from a year ago due to lower incentive compensation and project spending.  Global markets MG&A was $10.3 million, virtually unchanged from a year ago.  ", "Fourth quarter corporate net interest expense declined $7.6 million from a year ago with about $6.2 million of this reduction attributable to the depreciation of the Canadian Dollar versus the US dollar along with lower average debt balances in 2008.  Corporate other expense of $20 million was driven by a $17.9 million loss related to the cash settled total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster\u2019s common stock.  ", "Foster\u2019s stock price declined moderately during the fourth quarter so the value of the swap position had a negative cash settlement value of approximately $1.4 million at the end of 2008.  The underlying loss for global markets in corporate was $50.3 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter, a 21% decrease as a result of lower corporate G&A and interest expense in 2008.  ", "Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives.  In the fourth quarter we captured an incremental $22 million of cost savings as part of our three year $250 million resources for growth or RFG cost reduction initiative.  For the full year we achieved $87 million of savings which exceeded our 2008 goal by $10 million.  These cost reductions included our 42% share of RFG cost savings initiatives that were assumed by MillerCoors in the back half of 2008.  Our 42% share of these savings was $6 million in the second half.", "In addition to RFG savings, MillerCoors delivered $28 million of synergies in the back half of 2008 with nearly all of these achieved in the fourth quarter.  Moving beyond operating business unit performance, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 20% on a reported basis and 22% on an underlying basis.  Free cash flow for the full year 2008 reflected net cash generation of $220 million which was made up of positive operating cash of $412 million plus $39 million of proceeds from asset sales minus capital spending of $231 million.  ", "A number of one-time and discretionary cash usages reduced our 2008 free cash flow.  These fall in to four groups.  First, a portion of incremental cash needs related to MillerCoors totaled approximately $144 million during 2008.  These cash uses included retention, deal completion, integration and restructuring costs along with additional capital spending to capture synergies.  Second, MillerCoors also held incremental margin cash related to commodity hedges with our portion totaling $71 million which will come back in to our free cash flow during the next one to two years as the hedges roll off.", "Third, we made a $100 million voluntary contribution to our UK pension plan late in the year which I\u2019ll discuss in a minute.  Fourth, we paid approximately $22 million of one-time cash but debt extinguishment early in 2008.  All of these one-time cash uses will increase our cash flows in the months and years ahead.  If we exclude them, our 2008 underlying free cash flow was $557 million which is 1% above our original 2008 free cash flow goal of $550 million.  We achieved this despite $21 million of unfavorable foreign currency impact on cash during 2008.", "Total owned debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.75 billion excluding approximately $82 million of non-owned joint venture debt.  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $260 million at the end of the quarter resulting in owned net debt of $1.53 billion.  Looking forward, we expect full year 2009 marketing, general and administrative expense in the corporate and global market segment of approximately $150 million plus or minus 5%.", "Our initial 2009 view of corporate interest expense is approximately $90 million at today\u2019s foreign exchange rates.  Note that this view includes the net effect of new accounting rules for convertible debt and the deconsolidation of BRI.  Turning to our effective tax rate, we continue to anticipate that our underlying tax rates for full year 2009 will be in the range of 16% to 20% assuming no further changes in tax laws.  Because of the anticipated closing or settling of tax years, this is about six percentage points below our long term range of 22% to 26%.  Our capital spending outlook for 2009 is approximately $140 million.  As usual, this guidance excludes MillerCoors and self funded capital spending by our consolidated joint ventures primarily the Beer Stores in Ontario.", "Now, I\u2019ll give an important pension update which includes our preliminary view of expense and cash for 2009.  As some of you know, we have recently implemented steps to reduce future liabilities, increase funding levels and lesson the volatility of asset returns for the majority of our traditional defined benefit pension plans.  Since 2005 we\u2019ve closed many of our qualified plans to either future benefit accruals or new participants in the US, Canada and the UK.", "Most recently, we reached agreement to close our largest defined benefit plan which is in the UK to new benefit accruals in the first half of this year.  When we have closed plans we have migrated employees to defined contribution plans which reduces company risk and volatility.  In 2008 we made cash contributions totaling approximately $230 million to our defined benefit plans for Canada, the UK global teams.  ", "These included a voluntary contribution of $100 million late in the year to the UK plan.  Timing of this substantial one-time contribution was driven by attractive foreign currency rates and asset values late in 2008.  This contribution also gives us flexibility to determine our contributions to the UK plan during the next two to three years.  Due to the substantial voluntary contributions we made in recent years, our initial forecast indicates a significant decrease in cash contributions this year versus last year potentially to less than $50 million for 2009.", "Note that this view excludes pension plans with MillerCoors and other non-consolidated joint ventures.  We do expect MillerCoors to make cash contributions to its defined benefits pension plan in 2009 but the amount may not be determined until the second half of this year.  Besides making extra contributions, we reallocated the assets supporting our qualified pensions in the second half of 2007 and early 2008 to reduce our equity exposure to less than half of the assets.  ", "This strategic derisking substantially lessened the impact of the recent stock market crash on these plans. Because our pension liabilities and assets are primarily denominated in British Pounds and Canadian dollars, the recent weakening in those currencies has reduced the liabilities and had a favorable impact on the underfunded positions of our largest pension plans.", "As a result of these factors, our initial read on 2009 pension expense indicates no more than a minimal amount of defined benefit pension expense this year, likely to be less than $5 million for all of 2009.  As always this view excludes MillerCoors and any one-time curtailment gains or losses which are not included in our underlying results.  We will present more information regarding 2009 pension expense and contributions in our 2008 10K which will be filed later this month after our actuaries have completed their work as well as during our annual New York analyst meeting in early March.", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to 2009.", "Peter Swinburn ", "In 2009 we will continue to focus on building our strong brand as reducing costs in each of our businesses and generating cash.  In Canada, as with other markets, we will balance the priorities of price and volume with a bias to investing in growing our brands.  ", "Price discounting activity has continued, especially in the Quebec off premise channel.  Recent price increases across the major Canadian provinces have offset some of the impact of competitive discounting.  We will remain focused on balancing our strategic [inaudible] priorities and building the equity of our brands while ensuring that we continue to be price competitive on a market-by-market basis.", "Also, late in 2008 Blue Moon production was moved from a Montreal brewery to MillerCoors and we have taken action to reduce staffing levels and other costs to offset the negative financial impact of lower production levels.  In the US, the MillerCoors integration is proceeding well.  Talent selection was completed in the fourth quarter enabling the realization of significant organizational synergies.  In addition, non-organizational savings have been realized due to progress in brewery optimization and opportunities to consolidate national media buying, regional distributor meetings and insurance.  The US team is more confident than ever that they can deliver the $500 million annual synergies goal by the third year of combined operations.  ", "We\u2019re brand builders so we\u2019re committed to improving the performance of Miller Light in 2009.  Driving growth of both our premium light brands is critical to our success.  Accordingly, later this month we will launch a new marketing campaign for Miller Light which will relentlessly celebrate the brand\u2019s great taste.  ", "We will also focus on maintained momentum for Coors Light and capturing new growth through the success of MGD 64 and we will continue to build on the momentum of our craft and import brands Blue Moon and Peroni while leveraging and messaging an equity of our below premium brands Keystone Light and Miller High Life to take advantage of any consumer shifts towards value.  The power of the MillerCoors portfolio is starting to be realized.  ", "In the UK we anticipate the challenging trading environment to continue in 2009 due to the weak local economy.  Commodity inflation will also be a challenge in 2009.  Nonetheless, we believe that our UK business is now on a much firmer footing as it benefits from our new contract brewing arrangement, the Magners cider\u2019s agreement and recently supplier renegotiations.  Moreover, our brand strength has consistently supported positive pricing and we recently announced a 2009 price increase which will be effective in March.", "The following are our most recent volume results for each of our businesses early in the first quarter.  In Canada our comparable sales to retail in January declined at a mid single digit rate versus a year ago due to continued soft industry volume and tough comp comparisons compared to last year.  In the five weeks of 2009 our UK sales to retail have decreased at a low double digit rate from a year ago mostly driven by high yearend inventories in the off premise channel.", "In the area of cost outlook I\u2019ll start with our cost savings initiatives.  Looking to 2009, the final year of the RFG program, we continued to be confident that we can achieve our three year resources for growth goal of $215 million.  As we have emphasized previously, all RFG savings will be incremental to the $500 million of cost synergies to which MillerCoors is committed.", "Finally, for MillerCoors the timing to achieve the original goal of $50 million in synergies in the first 12 months of operations has accelerated and the US team now expects to realize $128 million of synergies by June 30, 2009.  By the end of calendar year 2009 we expect to achieve a total of $238 million in synergies, surpassing our original forecast of $225 million.  While the timing of synergy deliver has accelerated, our goal remains $500 million of annual cost synergies to be delivered by the third year of combined operations.  ", "Looking at the cost outlook by business, in Canada we expect our comparable 2009 cost of goods per barrel in local currency to increase at a low single digit rate versus 2008 due to continued inflationary pressures partially offset by anticipated reductions in certain commodity and fuel inflationary rates in 2009 along with continued delivery of our RFG savings initiatives.  ", "In the first quarter of 2009 we expect that we will discontinue our consolidation of Brewers Retail, Inc. or BRI which operates the Ontario Beer Stores.  We will begin accounting for BRI results this year using the equity method because our interest in BRI has been reduced following the Labatt\u2019s acquisition of Lakeport Brewing in Ontario.  This change will decrease Canada pre-tax income and decrease corporate interest expense a similar amount yielding no significant impact on consolidated net income.", "In 2008 for example, our BRI pre-tax income of about $10 million US was offset by BRI interest expense in corporate.  We also may record a one-time gain or loss related to deconsolidation of BRI due to new accounting rules this year requiring companies to apply fair value accounting to deconsolidations.  As we change this accounting presentation, on a go forward basis we will exclude these impacts to arrive at a comparable business impact. ", "Our UK team is targeting substantial savings as part of the resources for growth program driven by supplier negotiations and operations efficiencies.  In a challenging industry volume environment, our preliminary view for 2009 is that UK owned brand costs of goods will increase at a low double digit rate per barrel in local currency.  This is driven by mid single digit inflation and product mix changes which are related to relative growth in contract brewing, Magners cider and off premise sales.  Most of these mix changes will also increase net sales per barrel on a [inaudible] neutral to gross profit.  ", "Finally, with regard to foreign currency impacts, if the Canadian Dollar and British Pound stay where they are today relative to the US dollar, we would face substantial currency translation challenges in the first three quarters of 2009.  At current rates, Canadian Dollar devaluation would present a Canada pre-tax earnings headwind of approximately 15% to 20% of prior earnings in each of the first three quarters of 2009 with minimal impact in the fourth quarter.  ", "It is important to note that we expect our debt structure and currency hedging programs to offset about 50% to 60% of this currency translation impact in 2009.  British Pound devaluation would negatively impact our UK pre-tax earnings by about 25% to 30% in the second and third quarters of the year with a 10% impact in the fourth quarter.  Our UK business generally reports a small loss in the first quarter so currency effects are minimized then.  We have no significant currency hedges focused on the British Pound.", "To summarize our results and discussions today, 2008 posed many challenges for our company, particularly late in the year due to a stronger US dollar along with volume softness in our major markets and substantial commodity inflation across the business.  Nonetheless, in 2008 we continue to build our strategic brands, achieved revenue per barrel growth in all of our markets, exceeded all of our cost reduction targets, successfully launched MillerCoors pursued strategic initiatives in each of our businesses, strengthen our global organization and grew underlying earnings in a weakening global economy.  ", "During the year, we also reduced interest in overhead expenses, continue to improve our cash generating capabilities and strengthened our balance sheet.  Looking forward, we enter 2009 squarely focused on the fundamentals that drive results in this business in good times or in bad.  Our priorities are to build great beer brands and to grow revenue per barrel, deliver cost savings on or ahead of our commitments, generate substantial free cash and grow long term returns to Molson Coors shareholders.  ", "We look forward to giving you a strategic update around these priorities during our annual analyst and investor meeting in New York on Wednesday, March 4th and we hope to see you there.

I would say that the industry has been through these before and the length of time that the discounting takes place varies from time period to time period but we have particularly in the fourth quarter we did slightly pull back from our discounting and we were unsuccessful in changing the market conditions.  We will continue to do what is right for both our brand and the company.", "Kaumil Gajrawala \u2013 UBS", "As we think about the Montreal brewery moving Blue Moon out plus standing firm on pricing, the impact on volumes that might have, is there a need for maybe a broader cut in capacity in that region?  ", "Stewart Glendinning ", "What we did when we loss the Blue Moon volume was we made headcount changes there and actually we\u2019ve been able to totally offset the cost that we would have incurred with losing that volume so we don\u2019t foresee anything more at this point in time.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Kevin, I just wanted to follow up on Canada because it sounds like the industry volume has softened and the competitive environment is still pretty intense and I\u2019m just not sure what really gets better as you kind of think about the 2009 and whether you\u2019re looking at perhaps reinvesting a lot more of potential cost savings to reinvigorate volume in that market.", "Kevin T. Boyce ", "It\u2019s a bit of a tough call right now Judy.  If you stand back and look at the industry in 2008, the industry actually grew 1.1%.  So, over the last 10 years it\u2019s grown 1% so that\u2019s been very consistent.  There was some softness in the fourth quarter where it grew about a half a point.  That, we believe, was driven by a number of factors but there was a very difficult weather season right around the Christmas time period which would have hurt the industry at a very important time.  ", "So, it\u2019s a bit of a hard read there.  As we go in to January, what we\u2019re seeing is relative to a year ago as Peter mentioned, our shipments are down about mid single digits but if you look at last year as an industry and both our shipments as well, the anomaly is probably January, 2008.  If you could back to January 2007 and 2006 the numbers in January this year are pretty consistent with those.", "We are paying very close attention to it obviously with the economy and everything.  It would be very hard to say thought that the industry is soft as a result of the economy or any other factors right now, there are a lot of moving parts but it\u2019s something that clearly we\u2019re focused on.  In terms of go forward and what we would do from a pricing perspective or promotion perspective, we think we have pretty solid plans in place and we took pricing through many of the markets in the fourth quarter of last year so we enter this year from a pricing perspective in pretty good shape I think.", "Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then with the cost pressure easing in Canada in 2009 to low single digits, is there concern that actually the promotional environment gets even more competitive in that setting?", "Kevin T. Boyce ", "There is that risk.  What you\u2019re going to see is I think \u2013 I can\u2019t speak for competitors but for us you\u2019re going to see that benefit taking place over the course of the year as certainly commodity pricings are coming down but they\u2019re not going to come down all at once in say the first or second quarter type of thing.  But, there is the risk, I would say if you look at the rest of the country the promotions have been much more tactical than broad scale and I would see that continuing as well.

", "We\u2019re paying very close attention to that but I\u2019d say at a top level you are seeing some softness over the last months in the on premise channel and in total the industry looking a touch soft and I do say just a touch but it\u2019s a really hard read because of all the issues with weather and it is a softer time of the year.  If that were to happen and I was told anecdotally that back in the early 90s when it was a soft time that there was some trade down but we\u2019re not seeing it in our numbers yet.

The market was under 1% growth last year which it\u2019s very hard to judge year-to-year based on the market but we are getting pricing in the marketplace.  Pricing was taken in the October time period, minimum price has moved up as well so there is some encouraging news there.", "Promotion wise, you\u2019re not seeing an acceleration to be honest over the last three to four months, you\u2019re seeing a relatively constant heavy amount but not what I would consider what\u2019s happening in Quebec.  In the Western part of the country again, pricing has been taken particularly Alberta has been reliant on the energy industry and so it will be interesting to see with a softening in commodity prices and things like that how our industry holds up.  ", "Right now, because of the way we\u2019ve taken pricing year-over-year from one market to the next, we\u2019re having a bit of a hard read just in understanding how much of the changes in the industry are pricing, etc.  But, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on.  The Atlantic which is about 7% of the market continues actually to be a fairly good performer and we enjoy very good share growth there.  Again, from a discounting perspective nothing that\u2019s tremendously out of the ordinary there.  ", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "A question more specifically on Quebec, it seems like it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re saying it got worse in the fourth quarter, are you saying it got worse?  Then, what is to prevent it from getting worse from a pure share perspective if we except that you\u2019re going to be disciplined on price, your competitors choosing to be more promotional, what risk does that bring that your share performance gets worse?", "Kevin T. Boyce ", "I think we\u2019d like to be disciplined but honestly it\u2019s going to be to a point.  We\u2019re not prepared to not participate if all of our competitions are going to go that way.  We\u2019re the leader in Quebec and we think we\u2019re doing the right thing by not partaking in the early part of the quarter bus realistically if the whole market wants to participate we\u2019ll be there.  When you look at the fourth quarter, I think the change from earlier quarters was probably a greater participation of discounting in the independent channel.  The grocery channel was relatively consistent throughout the last nine months of the year as it went from just a grocery channel in to an independent channel and that we\u2019ll play close attention to as we enter this year.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "And it sounds like you\u2019re not seeing any evidence of your main competitor changing their tactical approach to the market with the various retailers.", "Kevin T.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. ", "I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Leo Kiely, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Sir, you may begin. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Matt. And hello and welcome everybody and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call are Tim Wolf, our Global CFO;, Kevin Boyce, CEO of Molson Canada; Frits van Paasschen, CEO of Coors Brewing Company; Peter Swinburn, CEO of Coors Brewers Limited; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal Officer; Mike Gannon, our Global Treasurer; Marty Miller, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "This morning, Tim and I will take you through some highlights of the second quarter for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with perspective on the back half of 2007. Then we will open it up for questions. ", "In the second quarter of 2007, we achieved double-digit earnings growth by delivering strong top line growth, substantial cost reductions, reduced interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. Let's look at some of the highlights. ", "We grew total company volume led by market share gains in the U.S. and Canada. This represents our first Canada share gain in nearly four years and the achievement of one of our most important goals leading into the merger. ", "Although overall global sales to retail declined 0.7%, due to a softness in the U.K. beer market, our sales to retail in North America grew 1.5% in the second quarter. In fact, the U.K. market on and off-premise channels each declined approximately 7% in the second quarter, driven by some of the wettest weather on record and cycling the 2006 World Cup tournament. ", "We continue our company-wide focus on brand building, and increased revenue per barrel and local currency in all three of our businesses. We captured additional merger synergies and next generation cost savings in the second quarter to bring our year-to-date savings from all cost programs to $78 million. Results from these initiatives allowed us to offset more than 80% of the cost of goods inflation impacting our company in the first half of this year. Both the synergies and next-generation cost reduction programs are on target for our 2007 goals. ", "We successfully brought our new Shenandoah brewery on line in the second quarter, with annualized cash savings of more than $30 million and P&L savings of approximately $14 per year. We increased total company income from continuing operations nearly 45% in the quarter, led by 39% pretax income growth for our U.S. business. Both of these results exclude special and other one-time items. ", "And we reduced our go-forward interest costs and effective tax rate by refinancing $625 million of our debt and refining as company structure. ", "Overall, we are pleased with our company's performance in the second quarter as our teams continue to progress on brand building and taking costs out of the business. So at this point, I will turn it over to Tim to review second quarter financial highlights and trends and then we'll provide some perspective on the balance of 2007 for the company. Timothy? ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Leo and hello everybody. Starting with the second quarter financial highlights for the total company, we reported consolidated sales volume of 11.5 million barrels, up seven-tenth of 1% from a year ago, while total company sales to retail declined seven-tenth of a percent in the second quarter. Volume growth was driven by brand strength in the U.S. and Canada, offset by weak market conditions in Europe. ", "Net sales were $1.68 billion, up 5.9% from the second quarter of last year, while cost of good sold increased 5.1%. Marketing, G&A expense grew 1.9% in the quarter. We achieved income from continuing operations of $176.1 million or $1.94 per diluted share, excluding special and other one-time items in the second quarter, which is up nearly 45% from $121.6 million or $1.40 per share a year ago. These results exclude a gain on the sale of our interest in House of Blues Canada this year and one-time tax benefits and net special charges in both years, which are described in the earnings release we distributed this morning. ", "Foreign exchange movements increased our total company pretax profit by approximately $7 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by a 9% appreciation of the British Pound and a 3% appreciation of the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. dollar. By the way, all the financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars, unless we indicate otherwise. ", "Please note that all our company earnings discussions today will be for continuing operations, that is, excluding the Kaiser Brazil business that we sold last year in January. ", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, we grew market share more than one-third of a share point versus the prior year. On the strength of this volume growth, along with cost savings initiatives and favorable foreign exchange rates, pretax income excluding special charges and one-time items increased 1.9% to $146.2 million in our second quarter. Favorable currency benefited Canadian pretax results about $5 million versus a year ago. ", "Positive factors in the quarter were partially offset by inflation, increased brand investments, and $5.8 million non-cash expense in the quarter related to mark-to-market adjustments on foreign currency hedge positions. These Canadian results exclude $24.1 million non-cash special charge related to the termination of our Foster's U.S. license agreement and $16.7 million one-time benefit from the sale of our ownership interest in House of Blues Concerts Canada, which is reflected in other income. ", "Our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the second calendar quarter ended June 30th increased 1.1% from the calendar quarter a year ago. Molson strategic brands continued their mid single-digit growth trend in the quarter fueled by Coors Light, Creemore, Carling and our partner import brands, which all grew at double-digit rates. Coors Light, our primary growth engine in Canada, has achieved double-digit STR growth in every quarter since the merger. In addition, Rickard's continued its high single-digit growth this quarter, while Molson Canadian experienced a mid single-digit volume decline. ", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail grew an estimated one-tenth of 1% in the calendar second quarter, so Molson achieved more than one-third share point gain. Molson Canada sales volume totaled 2.3 million barrels for the fiscal second quarter that ended July 1st, which is an increase of 4.0% from a year ago. Approximately 3 percentage points of this growth is due to the inclusion of the higher volume week leading into Canada, the Canada Day weekend in the second fiscal quarter this year, versus its inclusion in the third quarter last year. We expect this volume timing benefit resulting from the year-over-year alignment of weeks to reverse in our next third quarter. ", "Net sales per barrel increased approximately 1% in local currency, driven by positive sales mix toward higher revenue per barrel products, including Rickard's and our partner import brands. Approximately 3 percentage points of revenue per barrel from selective frontline price increases was almost entirely offset by higher price discounting focused in Ontario and Quebec. ", "Cost of goods sold per barrel increased approximately 6% in local currency, driven by the following factors: First, 2 percentage points of increase due to input cost inflation, which was more than offset by 3 percentage points of synergies and other cost savings within the quarter; a 3 percentage point increase from sales mix shift to higher cost, but also higher-revenue super-premium partner import brands; 2 percentage points of increase from a requirement to mark-to-market in the second quarter certain foreign currency hedge positions primarily related to future quarters; and finally, a 2 percentage point increase from other one-time impacts, including incremental costs to supply the market as a result of the Edmonton brewery strike. ", "Marketing, G&A expenses decreased 1% in local currency, driven by reductions in G&A expenses, which more than offset an increase in overall brand investment. ", "For our U.S. business, second quarter pretax income was $98.1 million, up 39.1% excluding special items a year ago. This increase was driven by sales volume growth, higher net pricing and continued savings from our operations initiatives. ", "Looking at U.S. highlights: Our 50-states sales to retail increased 2.0% and we grew market share again in the second quarter. This sales increase was driven by low single-digit growth for Coors Light, which achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of growth, along with strong double-digit growth of Blue Moon and mid single-digit growth of Keystone Light. Also, we're encouraged by the performance of Coors Banquet, which grew slightly in the quarter by refocusing the brand's positioning on its heritage, reinforcing the redesigned packaging and increased advertising investment. ", "Including our Caribbean business, total U.S. sales to retail increased 1.6% in our second quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. volume to wholesalers grew 3.1%, due to strong sales to retail growth and the timing of the 4th of July holiday in our fiscal calendar. U.S. net sales per barrel increased 2.2% in the second quarter, almost entirely due to higher frontline pricing. ", "Cost of goods per barrel decreased five-tenths of 1% in the quarter, driven by over $22 million of cost saving initiatives, and lower depreciation expense, which were offset by higher commodity, transportation and packaging material costs. ", "Our operations cost savings offset about two-thirds of the U.S. cost of goods inflation in the second quarter. U.S. marketing, G&A expense decreased nine-tenth of 1% in the second quarter, as higher brand-building and sales investments were more than offset by a decrease in G&A costs. ", "Our Europe business, second quarter pretax income of $38.9 million, excluding special items increased 5.1% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue per barrel, lower operations and administrative costs and higher pension income, along with favorable foreign exchange rates, which added approximately $4 million in pretax results in the quarter. ", "Pension income of $4.7 million in the second quarter, up $1.8 million from a year ago, reflects the improved funded status of our U.K. pension plans. These positive earnings factors were partially offset by cycling a $5.5 million gain on the sale of surplus land, which was reflected in Other Income for the second quarter of 2006. ", "In more detail: Our Europe owned brand volumes decreased 7.5%, due to cycling a benefit from increased sales during the World Cup soccer tournament last year, along with an extended period of very poor weather conditions this year. Recall that our volumes increased 5.1% in the second quarter last year, largely due to strong sales during the World Cup which is played every four years. Our U.K. market share this quarter was impacted only minimally as other brewers also faced difficult comparisons related to the World Cup last year and poor weather this year. ", "U.K. owned brand volume net revenue per barrel in local currency increased just over 4% in the second quarter, due largely to higher owned brand net pricing, with a portion of this benefit related to weak pricing a year ago during the World Cup. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of improving trends in owned brand pricing, which is an encouraging turnaround from the previous two years. ", "Cost of goods sold for our U.K. owned brands decreased about 1% per barrel in local currency, driven by cost savings from our supply chain restructuring program and higher pension income as our U.K. plans benefited from improved funded status and lower staffing levels this year. ", "Marketing, G&A expenses in the U.K. decreased approximately 1% in local currency. Marketing and sales spending increased at a low single-digit rate as we continued to roll out our new ad campaigns for Carling and C2. G&A costs declined faster than front-end spending due to continued savings from cost initiatives and higher pension income. ", "Moving beyond operating business unit performance, corporate G&A expense in the second quarter was $30.3 million, $2 million higher than a year ago from one-time fees related to restructuring some of our debt during the quarter. Corporate net interest expense, excluding U.K. trade loan interest income, was $27.8 million in the second quarter, which is $12 million lower than a year ago, driven by our repayment of debt during the past year and the benefit of cycling $4.6 million of expense last year related to adjusting Ontario Beer Store swaps to market value. ", "Our second quarter effective tax rate was 13% on a reported basis and 20% excluding special and one-time items. One-time tax items include: This year, the non-recurring benefit of a one-half percentage point reduction in the Canada corporate income tax as well as a one-time adjustment to our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits under the new FASB Interpretation No. 48 tax rules. These changes had the non-recurring effect of reducing our tax liabilities on the balance sheet and our quarterly tax provision by $11.5 million in the second quarter. ", "Second, last year's second quarter reported results benefited from a 2 percentage point reduction in the Canada corporate income tax rate, as well as minor changes in two provincial income tax rates as well. These tax rate changes had the one-time effect of reducing our deferred tax liability on the balance sheet and our quarterly tax provision by $52.3 million a year ago. ", "Free cash flow in the quarter totaled approximately $93 million, driven by operating cash flow of $221 million and asset sales of $33 million, minus $161 million of capital spending. Well over half of this CapEx was due to the repurchase of our U.K. keg float early in the quarter. ", "Net debt at the end of the second quarter was $2.0 billion, and that excludes approximately $100 million of non-owned joint venture debt. This figure is net of $680 million in cash at the end of the quarter, which is primarily the proceeds of the $575 million convertible debt offering that we completed in June. Early in the third quarter, these proceeds were then used to fund most of a tender offer for some of our higher-coupon notes issued about 7 years ago. ", "Special and other one-time items in the second quarter this year include two special charges; a gain on the sale of an equity interest in a company, and the discrete tax benefit that I mentioned a moment ago. Following are details on all, but the last of these items: Special charges, net totaled expense of $25.4 million pretax, are primarily due to the following: In Europe, we recognized $1.2 million of special restructuring expenses in the supply chain and other areas. In Canada, as we mentioned before, we impaired the value of our Foster's U.S. license agreement via a special charge of $24.1 million, which represents virtually all of our carrying value of this contract. Due to a recent adverse court ruling, this contract will expire in the fourth quarter of this year. ", "Also, Canada results benefited from $16.7 million gain on the sale of our 50% equity interest in the House of Blues Canada business during the quarter. This non-recurring gain is reflected in other -- is reported in other income net, but it is excluded from our underlying non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter. ", "Finally, in discontinued operations during the second quarter, we reported net income of $600,000, due to favorable FX rate movements, which more than offset a small increase in the indemnity estimates related to the Brazil Kaiser business. ", "Now, I'll preface the outlook session as usual by paraphrasing our Safe Harbor language. Some of what we talk about now and in the Q&A may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what we project today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and proxy filings for a more-complete description of factors that could affect our projections. We don't undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that we may discuss during the call, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. ", "Looking forward, we anticipate 2007 corporate net interest expense of approximately $115 million, plus or minus $2 million, and that excludes $24.5 million of one-time expenses related to tendering our $625 million of our 6-3/8% notes, a very successful transaction that we completed in July. In the past few months, we have completed significant corporate projects to improve our company tax structure and refinance a portion of our higher-coupon debt. We expect these projects to reduce interest costs substantially next year, and I will provide more details during the Lehman Back-to-School Conference in Boston in about 4 weeks. ", "We anticipate full year 2007 corporate G&A expense of approximately $100 million, plus or minus $3 million, which is a reduction of approximately $20 million versus 2006. ", "Turning to our effective tax rate, we anticipate that our full year 2007 rate will be in the range of 20% to 25%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. Note, the U.K. government early in the third quarter approved changes in depreciation treatments and a corporate tax rate reduction from 30% to 28%, both effective April 1st, 2008. We have not yet finalized our examination of the impact of this legislation. Also, the settlement of additional open tax years or passage of other tax legislation in the U.K. and Canada could alter our tax rate outlook. We now anticipate that our long-term effective tax rate on GAAP earnings will be in the range of 23% to 28%. ", "Our capital spending outlook for 2007 is approximately $425 million to $450 million, and that includes approximately $105 million for the acquisition of kegs in the U.K. this year and about $40 million of capital spending by our consolidated joint ventures. ", "Our current free cash flow outlook for 2007 is $170 million, and that's defined as cash from operations, minus capital expenditures and that include the one-time impact, as I said before, of buying back our U.K. kegs, plus non-strategic asset sales. This free cash outlook also includes $24.5 million of one-time costs related to tendering debt last month and an incremental $50 million voluntary cash contribution to our U.S. pension fund in the second quarter, and this increases our expected total pension contributions to approximately $220 million to $240 million for 2007. These contributions have allowed us to fully fund our pension obligations, given today's assumptions for plan asset returns and interest rates. ", "Our free cash flow plan excludes dividend payments and cash proceeds from stock option exercises, with option proceeds exceeding $165 million in the first half of this year. To be sure, our cash generation shows dramatic fluctuations from one day to the next, but we are optimistic that the business can achieve our free cash flow goal this year. Looking forward, we see much greater cash generating potential in this business than we are showing this year, and we will cover this in more detail in Boston next month. ", "Now, an update on our cost reduction initiatives, which provide resources to invest for brand growth and to drop to the bottom line. In the first half of this year, we captured an incremental $32 million of merger-related pretax cost synergies. We also achieved $46 million of next-generation cost savings during the first half of 2007 as part of the program to generate $250 million of additional savings by the end of 2009, which is our program that we've referred to in the past as Resources For Growth. Combining both programs, we are on track to achieve our goal of total cost savings of $121 million in 2007. ", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Leo for a look ahead to the balance of 2007. Leo? ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tim. Looking ahead, we will remain focused on building strong brands to grow the top line and reducing costs in each of our businesses to provide additional resources for growth. We'll also experience some cost of goods and other prior year comparison impacts that I want to highlight for those of you who model our business. ", "In Canada, we continue to focus on brand building and cost reductions. Our first priority remains investment for growth. We are focused on building the company's strategic brands and driving innovation behind those brands. In particular, we will leverage our innovation on Coors Light, driven by our Sub Zero cold draught dispense systems, new SKUs, and the introduction of the cold certified can. Further, we have extended innovation across our portfolio with the introduction of Creemore Traditional Pilsner and new programming on our partner import brand portfolio. ", "Our marketing team remains focused on continuing Rickard's momentum and stabilizing Molson Canadian. Strategies will include leveraging the introduction of Rickard's White, which is adding incremental volume to the trademark, as well as new programming and SKUs for the Molson Canadian brand. ", "For the month of July, our Canada sales to retail increased at a low single-digit rate, although it is important to note that July's results are not necessarily indicative of third quarter performance. ", "Due to year-over-year differences in our fiscal calendar, we expect third quarter sales volume to be lower than sales to retail. ", "On costs in Canada, we continue our focus on productivity across the business, including merger synergies and other cost saving initiatives in operations and G&A, to reinvest in our brands and offset inflation. Based on current commodity rates, we now expect underlying full year cost of goods per barrel to increase at a low to mid single-digit rate in local currency. That's excluding the mix impact of continued strong growth by our partner import brands, any incremental cost of the Edmonton strike, and the $11.3 million year-over-year impact of our requirement to mark-to-market certain foreign currency hedge positions. Without these exclusions, we anticipate that our reported cost of goods per barrel in Canada will increase at a high single-digit rate in local currency for full year 2007. ", "Last week, we announced the closure of our Edmonton, Alberta brewery to make our Canada business more cost competitive in an ever changing market. This action was based primarily on the loss of the Foster's U.S. production contract and the ongoing shift in the marketplace demand from bottles to cans, as the Edmonton brewery only has a bottle line packaging capacity. ", "Other key elements in the closure decision were the competitive need to reduce further operating costs and the labor impasse at the Edmonton brewery. This closure will result in the third quarter asset impairment of about $37 million and other, primarily non-cash charges of $10 million to $12 million over the balance of this year related to pension expense and other closure-related costs. We also plan to offer affected employees fair termination benefits, which will add some cash costs to the closure, but the impact of these benefits has not yet been determined. As part of the project, our Canada team is working to ensure a smooth transition of the Edmonton production to other breweries in our Canada network. ", "Turning to our U.S. business; our focus for the balance of 2007 is maintaining our current volume and share momentum and aggressively managing costs despite significant inflation. Our fundamentals remain strong, and the year-to-date pricing environment is positive. But, recall we face tougher volume comparables in the back half of the year, and in the third quarter we will begin to cycle more than $6 million of quarterly benefits related to the closing of the Memphis brewery a year ago. ", "Our priorities for the balance of the year are these four areas: First, we will continue to increase our investments this year behind Coors Light, Keystone Light and Blue Moon at a low single-digit rate versus last year and continue our initiatives to develop our regional brands, such as the refreshed Coors Banquet packaging and ad creative. For Coors Light, our priority is to constantly deliver refreshment as cold as the Rockies. Our Cold Activated Bottle and Frost Brew Lined Can deliver Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment in an innovative way. ", "Second, we will continue to go to market with discipline, strengthening our key retail accounts business and leveraging our NFL sponsorship as the football season begins. ", "Third, we will strengthen our export markets. While we maintain the leading share of the Puerto Rico beer market, the economic environment remains challenging in that market. ", "Fourth, we are focused on improving 3-tier profitability and service. To that end, our Shenandoah brewery is now fully operational, allowing us to diversify our brewing capability and reduce transportation time and costs to serve our East Coast customer base. We continue to expect U.S. cost of goods per barrel to increase approximately 2% for the full year of 2007, with the first half virtually flat and the second half growing at a mid single-digit rate. ", "With the current outlook for higher commodity inflation and cycling the Memphis plant closure, we expect our U.S. cost initiatives to offset only about one-third of the anticipated inflation in the second half of this year. In the first 4 weeks of the third quarter, our 50-state U.S. sales to retail were up about 4% from a year ago, partially driven by an unusually warm weather this year. ", "And finally, due to year-over-year differences in our fiscal 52-week versus 53-week calendar, we expect sales volume to be lower than sales to retail in the third quarter. ", "In our Europe business, we face challenges on four fronts. First, consumer spending in the U.K. economy continues to be soft across all categories, largely due to higher consumer interest rates and taxes. Second, the competitive environment in the U.K. beer industry continues to be challenging, both on-premise and in the take-home channel. As we have noted in previous quarters, the smoking bans in England and Wales have taken effect in the past few months, and they are expected to adversely affect our volume and profit trends for the next year or two. And then finally, poor weather experienced across the U.K. during the second quarter continued into July, and we expect that this will have a negative impact on results in the third quarter. Nonetheless, our U.K. team has done a great job staying focused on building brands for the long haul and cutting costs wherever possible. ", "On building strong brands, we will continue to manage our price promotions to optimize profitability. We plan to adjust the positioning of Coors Light in the U.K. to bring this brand closer to its global profile. This will include a name change from Coors Fine Light to simply Coors Light, along with new brand positioning and a new marketing program. We will increase the investment behind Coors Light and continue to actively support C2, our mid-strength lager entry from Carling. And we continue to roll out our new cold-dispense technology and distinctive above-bar fonts, which support our portfolio. We completed 20,000 installations during the first half of 2007 and currently expect a further 28,000 over the balance of the year. We continue to see sales uplift from these installations. ", "On managing costs; we will continue to attack costs to provide fuel for brand growth and to offset cost inflation. While the flow-through of cost initiatives implemented in the first half of 2006 will have less impact in the second half this year, additional cost reduction initiatives are underway. It is important to recognize that these cost reductions are being achieved while we are investing more to build our brands. ", "In the first five weeks of the third quarter, our Europe sales to retail have decreased at a mid single-digit rate from a year ago, largely due to continued poor weather across the U.K. ", "In summary, our second quarter results show the ability of our company to deliver on the promise of our merger. While the global challenges we face have not lessened, the teams across our company have built success one quarter at a time by staying focused on the key drivers of shareholder value in this business. We have consistently worked to build strong brands and attack costs to provide further resources for growth in both sales and earnings. Our most recent results show that we are investing to build our brands and grow share consistently, and we are exceeding our cost reduction goals, and we are growing profitability for our shareholders at a double-digit rate. ", "Looking ahead, we are confident that our teams can build on that momentum and win the all important summer selling season, while we make more progress building great brands, attacking costs, and becoming a top performing global brewer. ", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 3 PM Eastern Time today, our Investor Relations team led by Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast and recorded replay on our website. ", "So Matt, at this point, let's open it up for questions. ", "Question And Answer ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Judy Hong, Goldman Sachs. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. First, juts a couple of questions on Canada. If you could just update us on the competitive landscape, particularly in places where you've seen discounting activity pick up a little bit and then just in terms of your effort to stabilize Molson Canadian; in the quarter it was down again the mid single-digit pace. If you can just talk about whether you are seeing any sort of tangible progress on that effort? ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, so first if you look at the discounting, as you asked, it varies from province to province, region to region if you like. Historically, we've spent most of our time talking about Ontario and that is the biggest market, so I'd say that the second quarter has been pretty aggressive from all companies not just the majors, but also the local players as well and historically in our market, the first half of the year is a little bit heavier in discounting than the second half of the year. So, it's been competitive. We did get some pricing through earlier in the year, but by and large, the pricing has been dealt back. ", "In terms of Molson Canadian, we are seeing some stabilization in Ontario; we have a little bit of a weaker western part; we have some new areas that we are investigating to the back half; but clearly the segment that Molson Canadian participates in the premium segment is being attacked by outside and when you look at the growth, a really fantastic growth that we are getting on Coors Light, that to a degree is affecting our Molson Canadian brand in the most part of Canada. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then secondly, just in the U.S., can you just clarify where the distributor inventories level is at the end of the second quarter, because in the quarter I think the shipments were ahead of SCR and then you ended the first quarter with higher distributor inventory. So can you just help us understand where we are and then how we should think about that either being reverse for the balance of the year or any other factors to consider? ", "Frits van Paasschen - President and Chief Executive Officer, Coors Brewing Company", "Yes, sure this is Frits van Paasschen. The short answer to your question is our inventories are essentially flat compared to a year ago. The slightly more technical answer to the question is, if you look at our sales versus removal the first three quarters of the year, there is a lot of noise in that data. Now whether you not used that as comparison in order to determine or try to derive your own inventory levels. And I say that because we have the affect of the 53rd week, we have the fact that the 4th of July span two quarter, we have the Memphis build up and frankly, we had some pretty strong momentum in the marketplace. But as you look into the third quarter, you will see a shift where our sales will be below removals as opposed to what it had been in the first two quarters. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay and then just finally, on the free cash for generation, looking at next year 10 I guess is it now appropriate to think about the pension being fully funded that you really don't get the incremental pension income... pension contribution next year so you really get a much bigger swing into next year than we were previously expecting? ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, July this is Tim. I am presuming you are talking about cash flow specifically and as you can see from this year and the last few years... last two years since the merger we have put a lot of money into the pension plans, no question about it. I will share a little bit more detail on this in Boston. But we are at a point now where we feel really good about the funded status of all 3 of pension plans obviously we're responsible for all 3. With that said, I think that the amount of cash contribution we place under the pensions can moderate. Obviously this year 2007 is... will has been a very, very heavy CapEx year, the purchase of the CAG, the completion of the Mountain brewery, the completion of Shenandoah, a very, very appropriately aggressive roll out of cold dispense units in the U.K. that Leo mentioned and so we are looking forward to a very strong delivering on the promise so to speak cash flow for 2008 and again all go into that, and don't forget also in 2007 we have the additional pension contribution, we settled it last year when we closed Memphis, this is the year we have to pay the pipe that actually make the cash contributions. So all in, when you think about all the cash that we have this year I think the critical point of underlying free cash performance of Molson Coors is better than ever and we are rolling into 2008 with really good momentum. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great, thank you. ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, you are welcome. ", "Operator", "Thank you. O our next question comes from Robert Van Brugge from Sanford Bernstein. ", "Robert Van Brugge - Bernstein Research", "Good afternoon. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello Robert. ", "Robert Van Brugge - Bernstein Research", "Question about U.K. pricing, certainly it was lot better than what we had seen in previous quarters. Do you expect this trend to halt, in other words, are your competitors following on the price increases at this point? ", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer, Coors Brewers Limited", "Hi Robert, this is Peter Swinburn. We're actually showing sort of improving trends on pricing over last four quarters, so it is something of a continuum. Obviously, the comparisons with last year weren't as tough because of the pretty aggressive pricing around World Cup. As far as the competitor is concerned, really there's just lot of volatility in the marketplace. We've made it clear from the outset that it's... we will try as best as we can to play the part of the profit optimization roots as far as both volume and pricing is concerned and certainly this quarter we seem to record it more right than wrong but we'll continue to take the judgment calls and obviously move forward to the year, but so far so good I think. ", "Robert Van Brugge - Bernstein Research", "Okay, great, thanks. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Robert. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks operator, good morning everyone. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi Mark. ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Hi Mark. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "I guess Kevin, two questions on Canada on a local currency basis. Firstly, on Coors Light, was pricing net sales per barrel for the brand up in the quarter year-on-year? ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "Yes, it was. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Can you give us some idea of how much? ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "Net sales per barrel; I'd say very low single-digit. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. And then same thing with Molson Canadian. It sounds like it was down, was it down low single-digit, down mid single-digit, what level of decline in terms of current local currency was it down? ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "In terms of the net sales per barrel or absolute? ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes, net sales per barrel local currency. ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "It was probably up a touch. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Up at touch. ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "Yes. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And you feel like both those brands because of the first half being a little more competitive, you'll see a little bit of an improvement in the second half? ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "Well it's always hard to tell, but if you look historically at the industry, a lot of the push if you like has come in the earlier part of the year, but I guess it depends on the plans that everybody has and where they are relative to their targets. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. And those numbers were total region, right? ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "Total country, yes. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great, thank Kevin. ", "Kevin Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "Okay. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Mark. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Farkas with Merrill Lynch. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Actually, all my questions has been answered, thank you. ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Christine. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Christine. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Banc of America. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning guys. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey Bryan. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Couple of question; first Tim, if you could just touch on working capital and I may have missed this in your prepared remarks, but just working capital in the quarters seemed awful high? ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, absolutely and it was high obviously building inventories, gabbled off a bunch of it, but we had timing difference in payables and receivables in the U.K. Obviously, there is a big, big swing there, given the size of some of our customers there. We have higher bonus payments this year than last year. Last year, they were meager, this year they were stronger. So there is a higher payments there. So we have lot of working capital movement the wrong way in the second quarter, but again I had focused you and others on the underlying performance, virtually all of the working capital use if you will, in my mind it's timing and if anything if you look at how Shenandoah is operating, how our plants were operating, how are Canadian supply chain will work pre and post Edmonton closure, if anything are objective will be to cycle tighter faster useless working capital and I think we've got the plans and direction in place to do just that. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Okay. And then a follow up on Judy's question on pension. On the P&L next year given the amount that you put into your pension now, will pension expense become a point of positive leverage next year? ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Well if what you are asking is, we are seeking pension income? The answer is no. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Okay. ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "I mean this is... our objective is to have I mean, have our operating businesses generating more profit as a result of good investments growing our business. We are a beer company not a pension income company. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Right. ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Right? So our job on the pension side is to mitigate risk, moderate and lower the amount of cash we have to put in because our pensions are well funded and returning adequately at a very, very acceptable level of risk. So to me, the way I look at the business I think our CFOs look at the business is pension income is nice, but that's not what we seek to do. We seek to sell more beer, so the going in proposition for 2008 is we will have less, I mean, I'll go into some of this detail next month, but to have less pension income per se and more risk mitigation and less need to put more cash into our pension funds. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Okay great. And then just one last if I could, on the Shenandoah brewery, did you operate... this quarter did you operate it full capacity this summer and then looking ahead, did your cost savings assumptions assume any ramp down in production or in your investment in Golden. I guess meaning, as Shenandoah wraps up, ramps up the full capacity, it leaves open the possibility to start reducing the cost and shrinking your footprint a bit in Golden, is that part of what's in your cost savings estimates going forward? ", "Frits van Paasschen - President and Chief Executive Officer, Coors Brewing Company", "Yes Bryan, this is Frits. To be clear, Shenandoah is fully up to speed. In fact, it just had a few weeks operating and more than a 100% of what we anticipated its ability to perform, that's both in brewing and in packaging. So we are actually thrilled with the performance of that facility and invite everybody to come down and have a look when hey have a chance. So the first part of your question is, is Shenandoah up and running, absolutely in a great shape. The second part of your question relates to, are there further cost savings coming through Golden? I would answer that a little bit more broadly and that is first of all, as we grow the business, we will continue to have to put out quite a bit of volume through our Golden brewery operations. But having said that we continue to invest in fine ways to make the most of that facility to automate where we can and drive efficiencies and yes, those kinds of savings are absolutely built into our cost projections for the year. ", "Timothy V. Wolf - Global Chief Financial Officer", "Bryan, this is Tim. Just as a add on to Frits and Dennis Puffer's modesty, I mean, if you look at the way Shenandoah was operating, its about 50%, about 47% of last look, more productive than Golden on a per person per barrel basis. And what they are achieving is by having brewing and packaging capacities in an obviously close proximity. The packaging capacities which already were among the most efficient in the world, are operating at even a higher levels of efficiency. So the story is not completely told yet, in terms of how high is up but I think Frits' and Dennis' teams have done a spectacular job in beginning to squeeze even greater savings of over and apart from just the freight savings out of the Shenandoah decision. ", "Frits van Paasschen - President and Chief Executive Officer, Coors Brewing Company", "And just to build again on what Tim saying, I want to call you back towards what Leo read in the prepared remarks, which is as we get to the second half of the year, we won't be in the position of anniversarying the Memphis closure from a year ago. So the savings that we have achieved in the first half of the year are certainly better than they will be in the second half. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities LLC", "Okay great, thanks guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS. ", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS", "Hi. Can you talk a little bit about what's behind some of the growth in Keystone and what it... where it is as a percent our portfolio now that its being going double-digits I guess for about 6 months or so? ", "Frits van Paasschen - President and Chief Executive Officer, Coors Brewing Company", "Yes. There are really 2 drivers to Keystone, right. Now one is we think we have a... we found a real chord with the lower premium drinkers around our positioning smooth even when you are not and based on the substance that we think Keystone is... the Keystone White is the smoothest of the below premium beers and that's a great place to be with the product. But in addition to that, because of the velocities we've enjoyed through that positioning, our distribution growth has been ahead of even what we hoped for and that is one of our stretch objectives for the year. And given the relative share of Keystone Light compared to the other major below premium brands and the consequent lower distribution that we have today with Keystone that distribution growth is an opportunity we see paying off for the next several years. So I don't think its by any means, an accident its a relationship between great positioning and frankly a terrific product and then some very focused efforts around gaining distribution, which we see is a long term opportunity. ", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS", "It's useful. Could I just maybe drill a little bit deeper, if you could talk about channel a little bit as it relates to Keystone? ", "Frits van Paasschen - President and Chief Executive Officer, Coors Brewing Company", "We are seeing growth really across channels both in sea store and key accounts in groceries and the growth has been terrific actually for us. ", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS", "Okay great thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Mr. Kiely, I am showing no further questions. ", "W. Leo Kiely III - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Matt; thanks everybody for being with us. For those of you who will be Boston, we will see you soon and for those of you who won't, we will track to you at end of third quarter. Thanks for your continued interest in Molson Coors and have a great day. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Leo Kiely, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Sir, you may begin. ", "Leo Kiely III", "Thanks, Matt. Hello and welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. With me on the call today are Tim Wolf, our global CFO; Kevin Boyce, President of Molson Canada; Peter Swinburn, CEO of Coors Brewing Company; Mark Hunter, CEO of Coors Brewers Limited; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal Officer; Mike Gannon, global Treasurer; Marty Miller, Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "This morning Tim and I will take you through some highlights of the fourth quarter and full year 2007 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some initial perspective on 2008 and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "In 2007, despite significant competitive and cost inflation challenges in each of our markets, our company results showed the value of building brands, reducing costs, and staying keenly focused. Equally important, we continue to deliver on the promise of the Molson Coors merger three years ago. For the second consecutive year, we achieved solid top line momentum and substantial cost reductions that exceeded our goals and double-digit earnings growth. ", "So let\u2019s review some highlights for 2007. At the global level, we grew Coors Light comparable sales to retail nearly 4% globally for the full year 2007 and more than 5% on the second half. ", "We achieved net sales growth of nearly 6% in 2007, driven by brand strength, positive pricing, and the benefit of favorable foreign currency. ", "We grew net pricing in all three of our businesses on the strength of our brands and the discipline of our sales teams. ", "We kicked off our next generation resources for growth cost reduction program early in the year and wrapped up our original three-year merger synergies program at the end of 2007. ", "For both programs, we exceeded our 2007 financial goals. Across the company, we captured more than $146 million of cost reductions, including $55 million of merger synergies and $91 million of resources for growth cost savings in the year. ", "The success of these cost reduction programs allowed us to offset more than 80% of the $175 million of cost inflation that challenged our company in 2007, including more than $120 million of commodity and other inflation in the U.S. business alone. ", "We continue to invest at the high level in our brands and sales capability in each of our businesses. We generated $226 million of free cash flow in 2007 despite the need to fund more than $250 million of one-time cash uses. ", "We strengthened our financial foundation and reduced interest and other non-operating expenses more than $26 million annually by refinancing more than a fourth of our debt, making substantial voluntary pension contributions and streamlining our corporate legal structure. ", "Excluding special and other one-time items in both years, we grew 2007 consolidated income from continuing operations 40% to $507 million after tax. This increase was driven by our strategic brand growth, positive pricing and cost initiatives, as well as favorable currency movements and a lower tax rate. ", "In the U.S., we are seeing the results of more than two years of focused work to transform the front-end of the business and reduce costs. In 2007, our team stayed focused and achieved very strong sales to retail and market share growth on each of our four largest brands. ", "For our U.S. portfolio -- excuse me, our U.S. portfolio also showed broad-based strength by growing sales to retail in 45 out of 50 states and all major channels. As a result, we grew market share in the U.S. at an accelerating pace in 2007. We reduced transportation and other costs and improved service to our East Coast customers by opening up our new brewery in Virginia, and we developed plans to make our U.S. business even more competitive by announcing an agreement with SABMiller to merger our U.S. operations into a joint venture and capture $500 million of cost reductions over three years. This deal also offers substantial growth benefits and represents potentially the biggest value driving deal in global beer today. ", "In Canada, our team continued to make significant progress against our commitments from the merger three years ago, including accelerating volume growth and balance share and pricing priorities. In 2007, our team gained market share on a full-year basis for the first time in six years and only the second time in 17 years, driven by Coors Light and our other strategic brands. At the same time, we continued to strategically increase net pricing in a very competitive market, based on the growing strength of our brands. ", "An important achievement for future growth was the team\u2019s success in securing new relationships with each of our major partner brands in Canada for the long haul. These relationships give our Canadian business the three largest import brands, Corona, Heineken, and MGD, and the broadest portfolio in that market. ", "We reduced cost and improved access to the Canadian maritime markets by closing our brewery in Edmonton, Alberta and opening a new brewery in Moncton, New Brunswick. ", "In Europe, our team continued to make the best of a very challenging competitive environment by building strong brands and growing pricing and profit. In 2007, our Europe team grew net pricing for the first time in three years and increased operating profit for the second consecutive year by staying focused and disciplined at retail, by building our strategic brands, and by reducing costs aggressively. ", "These results represent a substantial achievement in the U.K. market that faced smoking bans, weak consumer spending, and record-breaking wet weather, which resulted in a volume decline of approximately 4% for the industry in 2007. ", "So in total, we are pleased with the progress of Molson Coors Brewing Company and what we achieved in the past year in both top line and bottom line growth, as well as in strengthening the company\u2019s financial foundation and competitive position. ", "So at this point I will turn it over to Tim to review fourth quarter financial highlights and trends and then we\u2019ll provide some perspective on 2008, so Timothy. ", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Thanks, Leo and hello, everybody. I will start with fourth quarter financial highlights. In the last quarter of 2007, each of our businesses faced difficult competitive conditions and cost inflation, as well as cycling the 53rd week in the fiscal 2006 calendar. Still, our company maintained momentum to grow net sales and gross profit and reduced cost, which allowed us to invest in our brands and grow total company operating income and after-tax earnings strongly in the fourth quarter, as we detailed in our earnings release earlier today. ", "On the bottom line, we achieved income from continuing operations of $133 million, or $0.73 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, and this is up 23.6% from a year ago excluding special and other one-time items. ", "Foreign exchange movements increased our total company pretax profit by approximately $12 million in the fourth quarter, excluding special and other one-time items, driven by the appreciation of the Canadian dollar and the British Pound versus the U.S. dollar. ", "On the other hand, cycling the additional week in our 2006 fiscal calendar reduced fourth quarter pretax profit this year by approximately $6 million and reported sales volume by about 600,000 barrels. ", "These results exclude one-time tax rate benefits in the fourth quarter this year, restructuring and brewery closure costs in Europe and Canada, as well as expenses related to our proposed U.S. joint venture. These adjustments are described in more detail in the earnings release, news release we had distributed this morning. Unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars. ", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, pretax income of $129.6 million excluding special charges in the fourth quarter was 2.9% lower than the year ago. The decline was driven by the impact of the additional week of sales in the prior year and higher cost of goods per barrel, which was largely offset by positive net pricing and $18 million benefit from favorable foreign currency. ", "Our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the fourth calendar quarter ended December 31st increased seven-tenths of 1% versus a year ago, driven by mid-single-digit growth of our strategic brands, which account for more than 85% of our total volume. ", "Coors Light continues to fuel this growth by posting a high-single-digit increase in the quarter while Rickard\u2019s, Creemore, Carling and our partner import brands all grew at double-digit rates. Molson Canadian experienced a mid-single-digit volume decline in the fourth quarter. ", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail grew an estimated eight-tenths of 1% in the calendar fourth quarter, resulting in a very slight market share decline for our Canada business compared to prior year, as we ran fewer price promotions on our strategic brands than some of our competitors. ", "For the full calendar year, we grew share slightly in the Canada market, driven by share growth over the key summer selling period on the strength of our strategic brands. Our Canada sales volume totaled 1.9 million barrels for the fiscal fourth quarter ended December 30th, which is a decrease of 3.8% from a year ago excluding 130,000 barrels of sales volume in the 53rd week in our fiscal 2006 calendar. ", "This decline was entirely due to the termination of our Foster\u2019s U.S. production contract earlier in the fourth quarter, partially offset by a slight increase in our Canada market sales volume. ", "Net sales per barrel increased 4.5% local currency, driven by positive net pricing and increased sales mix toward higher revenue-per-barrel products. Net pricing contributed half of this increase as we benefited from selective price increases over the past year and less price discounting in Ontario. The remainder of the increase was due to improved sales mix in the quarter, driven by the termination of our low revenue-per-barrel Foster\u2019s U.S. production contract. ", "The cost of goods sold per barrel increased approximately 11% in local currency in the fourth quarter. The majority of the increase was again due to the termination of the Foster\u2019s U.S.A. production contract, a shift in sales mix to partner import brands, and a favorable currency adjustment of $4 million in the prior year. The remaining cost of goods sold per barrel increase was limited to a 3% increase due to inflation and other costs, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives. ", "Marketing, general administrative expense in the quarter decreased approximately 7% in local currency, driven by cost reduction initiatives implemented in the year and lower overhead expenses, including lower non-cash amortization. ", "For our U.S. business, fourth quarter pretax income was up $71.5 million, up 39.7% excluding special items this year. This increase was driven by sales volume growth, higher net pricing and continued savings from our operations cost initiatives, offset by continued inflation and key commodities and transportation costs. ", "Recall that we\u2019re cycling the 53rd week in our fiscal 2006 calendar, which added about 330,000 barrels to U.S. sales volumes and was approximately break-even in profit. ", "So looking at U.S. highlights, sales to retail in the 50 states U.S. increased 6.2% on a comparable basis and we accelerated our market share growth in the fourth quarter. This increase was driven by mid-single-digit growth for Coors Light, which achieved its 11th consecutive quarter of growth, along with strong double-digit growth of Blue Moon and low-double-digit growth of Keystone Light. Coors Banquet accelerated its turnaround momentum in the fourth quarter by growing at a low-double-digit rate. ", "U.S. volume to wholesalers grew 2.0% due to strong sales-to-retail growth offset by cycling the 53rd week in 2006. Without the impact of the extra week in 2006, shipments increased 8.1% in the fourth quarter. ", "U.S. net sales per barrel increased 2.1% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher frontline pricing. Cost of goods per barrel increased 2.0% in the quarter, driven by higher commodity, transportation, and packaging material costs, which were partially offset by over $20 million of cost-saving initiatives and lower depreciation expense. Our operations cost savings in the fourth quarter offset about two-thirds of our U.S. cost-of-goods inflation. ", "On a full year basis, our cost of goods per barrel increased nine-tenths of 1%, driven by more than $120 million of cost inflation. Nearly two-thirds of this inflation was offset by our merger synergies and other operation cost reduction initiatives. ", "U.S. marketing and general administrative decreased 6.1% in the fourth quarter, driven by year-over-year timing differences in marketing expense. ", "Our Europe business fourth quarter pretax income was $38.1 million excluding special items, which is an increase of 17.9% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue per barrel, savings in general administrative expense, and $2 million of favorable foreign exchange. ", "These factors were partly offset by the negative impact of lower volumes as a result of recently enacted smoking bans along with weak consumer spending. Year-over-year results, the comparisons are also affected by the additional week in our fiscal 2006, which include volume of about 140,000 barrels and a pretax loss of $1 million in our 2006 fourth quarter results. ", "Our Europe owned brand volumes decreased 10.7% on a reported 13-week versus 14-week basis.

", "Our Europe net revenue per barrel in local currency increased by 6% in the fourth quarter, with approximately four percentage points of this change related to non-owned factory brands that we deliver to retail, driven by our acquisition of the Cameron\u2019s on-premise distribution business early in the third quarter. ", "The addition of this business will raise our Europe net sales per barrel and cost of goods per barrel several percentage points for the next year, due to a step up in our factory brand sales. ", "U.K. owned brand net revenue per barrel in local currency increased nearly 3% in the fourth quarter as a result of higher pricing, mainly in the on-premise channel. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in owned brand pricing. Total Europe cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency increased by 5% in the fourth quarter, with all this change related to factory brand sales, including Cameron\u2019s.

This $13 million reduction from last year -- this roughly $13 million reduction from last year is attributable to the debt repayments and restructurings we\u2019ve undertaken in the past year to strengthen our financial foundation, partially offset by the higher interest costs of a stronger Canadian dollar.

", "Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives -- first, we over-delivered against our three-year, $175 million merger synergies target and wrapped up this program with $180 million of savings delivered, including an incremental $5 million of merger-related synergies in 2007. ", "Second, we are already ahead of schedule on our three-year, $250 million resources for growth cost reduction initiatives. We\u2019ve achieved $91 million of savings during 2007, which is the first year of this program, which is $25 million more than the initial 2007 target we shared a year ago. We exceeded our first-year cost target by more than 37% by accelerating a number of our cost reduction programs, particularly in our North American supply chain. Combining both cost reduction programs, we have captured $146 million in total 2007 cost savings. ", "For 2008, we continue to target an incremental $77 million of cost reductions from the resources for growth programs. Regardless of when the U.S. JV might be completed, we intend to capture these cost savings and the JV will provide substantial additional savings beyond our existing resources for growth program.

In 2008 we remain focused on building strong brands and reducing costs in each of our businesses, and we\u2019ve ended the new year with encouraging momentum. Our strategic brands in Canada are building volume momentum and taking share. In the U.S., we have strong and broad volume and market share momentum on our four largest brands. ", "We are holding the line on pricing in Europe and helping our retail customers work through the smoking bans and in all three of our businesses, the strength of our brands is supporting positive pricing and cost reductions are providing resources to offset inflation and grow our business. ", "To keep this momentum rolling in 2008, in Canada we\u2019ll continue to build on the momentum of our strategic brands, where we\u2019ve experienced strong volume growth. We\u2019ll continue to bring innovation to the market in new packages, promotions, and advertising platforms, including the cold certified can for Coors Light and new advertising creative for all the Molson brands that will launch and evolve in 2008. ", "We\u2019ll continue to build on our super premium portfolio of owned and partner brands through new programming and unique SKUs, leveraging the double-digit growth of these brands in 2007. ", "The most recent example of our efforts in this critical segment is our new long-term joint venture with Grupo Modelo effective at the beginning of this year, to import and distribute and market the Modelo beer portfolio across Canada. The joint venture builds on the previous successful relationship we have with Modelo as we now pick up these super premium brands for our portfolio in the Western Provinces. ", "In the U.S., we are staying focused in 2008 on maintaining our strong volume and share momentum while continuing to aggressively reduce costs. Coors Light, Keystone, and Blue Moon will remain our primary focus in 2008, along with maintaining strong momentum behind the Coors Banquet brand. We also have designed initiatives to improve sales trends for Killian\u2019s and Molson Canadian. ", "In 2008, we\u2019ll continue to drive sales by increasing our marketing and sales spending at a mid-single-digit rate, growing our retail key account business to increase distribution, and becoming better aligned with our distributor network by pushing accountability for profitable brand growth to our local levels. ", "We will drive sustainable volume and profit growth by continuing to make a disciplined approach in both front-end pricing and discounting, while continuing to build our core brand equities which, as you know, for Coors Light is all about Rocky Mountain cold refreshment. ", "Turning to Europe, in addition to strong marketing investment behind Carling, we\u2019ll continue the relaunch of Coors Light. We\u2019ve recently secured distribution for Coors Light in J.D. Witherspoon, a major on-premise customer and a particularly attractive venue for building a brand loyalty among our core consumers. ", "We\u2019ll also continue to roll out our new cold dispense technology in distinctive above-bar fonts, which support our whole portfolio via cold positioning and modern brand representation. We completed 46,000 installations in 2007 and plan to install another 40,000 in 2008.

", "In 2008, there are a few additional considerations regarding volume. In Canada, our sales to retail in January have increased at a low-single-digit rate on a comparable basis, though as always it\u2019s hard to call a full quarter based on only a month of results. ", "With the termination of Foster\u2019s U.S. production contract in the fourth quarter of last year, we expect Canadian sales volume to be lower in the first three quarters of 2008 compared to 2007. The loss of this contract will result in lower reported sales volume but will have no impact on sales to retail. ", "The Foster\u2019s termination will also increase net sales per barrel as well as cost of goods per barrel over the next three quarters, due to lower fixed cost leverage on lower production volumes. ", "We continued our solid momentum in the U.S. to start the first quarter. Overall in the first five weeks of the first quarter, our 50-state U.S. sales to retail grew at a high-single-digit rate from a year ago. In Puerto Rico, we expect continued challenging economic conditions to impact our volume trends. ", "Based on the particularly strong volume momentum of our largest brands in the past several months, we expect our distributors to build their inventories approximately 180,000 barrels more in the first quarter this year than a year ago as they prepare for peak season. This will benefit our U.S. volume and financial results in the first quarter versus last year.

", "In the first six weeks of the first quarter, Europe sales to retail decreased at a mid-single-digit rate from a year ago. ", "Regarding cost reductions, our teams exceeded their goals in 2007 and are striving to repeat this accomplishment in 2008. Looking at the cost outlook by business, in Canada we anticipate that our reported cost of goods per barrel will increase at a mid-single-digit rate in local currency for the full year 2008. But if you exclude the mix impacts from increased partner import volume and lower contract brewing volume, we expect costs of goods sold per barrel to increase at a low-single-digit rate. ", "In the U.S., we currently expect our 2008 cost of goods per barrel to increase at a low-single-digit rate as well. We are confident that we will meet or exceed our cost reduction goals this year via the resources for growth program, which continues to be a top priority because we anticipate cost challenges again in two major areas. ", "First, based on the current outlook for commodities and other inputs, we expect transportation and fuel costs to increase significantly in the year, along with moderate increases in packaging costs. ", "Second, we\u2019ll have higher contract packaging fees and a full year of Shenandoah brewery depreciation expense in 2008. ", "This outlook excludes the proposed Miller/Coors joint venture which would accelerate our potential cost savings in the U.S. ", "In Europe, the team will continue to attack costs to offset input inflation and provide fuel for our brand investments. Additional cost reduction initiatives are being pursued with initiatives already under way in the supply chain and head office support services. ", "We announced late in 2007 that we\u2019ve entered into an agreement with Scottish & Newcastle to contract brewing kegs selected S&N lager brands. Brewing will begin around the middle of 2008 and reach full production in 2010. We\u2019ll be producing up to 3 million hectoliters of lager for S&N annually. This will generate additional income and fixed cost leverage in our U.K. brewing footprint. ", "Based on improved projected longevity for retirees in the U.K., we do not expect to benefit from U.K. pension income in 2008, a departure from the past two years. ", "And finally, looking at the quarterly flow of pretax earnings, cycling the England smoking ban at mid-year and picking up the benefit of the S&N production contract starting in the second half, yields a Europe financial plan weighted toward the second half of the year. ", "In summary, we are pleased with our progress in 2007 and we are excited about the future for Molson Coors Brewing Company. We took several bold steps last year towards our vision to become a top performing, global brewer. We\u2019re building an innovative brand-led organization that can compete and win in a dynamic global beer industry. ", "Our proposed U.S. joint venture with SABMiller represents an important step in this direction. The joint venture will create a stronger U.S. brewer with the scale, resources, and distribution platform to compete more effectively in the highly competitive U.S. beer market. ", "The opportunities provided by the joint venture include $500 million of annual cost synergies by the third full year of the JV, which will strengthen our business and enhance financial performance. And the U.S. JV will provide tremendous momentum and resources for Molson Coors to compete in the global marketplace, while offering substantial benefits for our U.S. distributors, retailers, and beer drinkers. ", "While working diligently to complete this transaction, we signed a definitive agreement in December and are cooperating fully with the regulatory clearance process. The closing of the transaction is subject to obtaining clearance from the U.S. Department of Justice, other regulatory clearances, and third-party consents. We look forward to closing the deal in mid-2008. ", "Pending completion of the JV, we will stay focused on delivering strong results. I continue to be impressed with the focus, energy, and commitment that our U.S. team has applied to maintaining record-breaking momentum in that business. ", "Globally, we are building a strong, deep team and are confident we can manage through this period of JV approval with solid momentum and emerge stronger than ever. All of our business unit CEOs have their teams tightly focused on driving profitable growth in each of their markets as we continue to focus on becoming a top-performing global brewer.

Also, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, our investor relations team, led by Dave Dunnewald, will host a follow-up conference call, which is essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast and recorded replay on our website. ", "So at this point, Matt, let\u2019s open it up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Tim, I was hoping, if you could just give us a little bit more color in terms of this lower tax rate forecast for 2008. I mean, it\u2019s clearly a much lower number than your ongoing rate. What\u2019s driving that? Is it not affecting your cash flow? And thirdly, whether there\u2019s sort of an opportunity to take down your long-term tax rate?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "We\u2019ll save a lot of the detail for Dave\u2019s call but this doesn\u2019t immediately reduce cash taxes. As I said, this phases in over the next few years. There\u2019s a reasonable possibility sure that this could over time lower that range that I gave you, the 22% to 28% and again, we\u2019ve got to just see what happens on the legislative front. Obviously this is good news when our biggest profit, biggest cash generating market, its government deems that lower taxes is a good thing. It\u2019s a good thing for Canada and it\u2019s a good thing for Molson Coors. ", "So yeah, I think this will play itself out to be a slightly lower over time tax rate and certainly in 2008. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then just a question on Canada, Kevin. It looked like in the fourth quarter you saw better net pricing per barrel growth and you\u2019ve talked about reducing discounting in Ontario. Can you just talk about the competitive dynamics there and as you look out 2008, is this sort of a trend that we could look forward to in terms of getting better pricing and still maintaining the improved share trend that you\u2019ve seen in that market?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Judy, if you look at the fourth quarter, our net pricing was probably about 2.5% on a national basis and clearly we did pull back on our activity compared to a year ago, so it\u2019s encouraging to see that our share performed pretty well in the face of that. ", "If you look at what\u2019s happening so far year-to-date, the activity is about the same, maybe a little bit less in Ontario than what\u2019s happened last year at this point in time. But this is early in the year and these are pretty small from a volume perspective, so we\u2019ll have to kind of play it by ear going forward, but certainly our performance in the fourth quarter was encouraging. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Banc of America. ", "Joe Herak - Guttermer Research", "Actually, this is Joe [Herak] with [Guttermer] Research. A couple things, Leo; congratulations on the solid numbers. You always seem to come through in very challenging times. Can you provide some more color as to what you are doing for your supply chain initiatives to reduce manufacturing cost per hectoliter as you originally promised $150 million in synergy or savings to decrease working capital?", "Leo Kiely III", "Tim, you want to speak on that?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Yeah, and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re referring now to our resources for growth effort for this past year and the next few years. We\u2019re continuing to look for ways to optimize our footprint. I think you saw in the fourth quarter the work that our Canadian team lead on optimizing how they would source volume for Canada by the careful shutdown of Edmonton is a great example. And as we found, the more we work this, whether it\u2019s optimizing the Canadian production footprint, doing the same thing in the U.S., obviously we\u2019re seeing the impact this year and we\u2019ll see a continued impact in the first part of \u201908 from the construction of the Shenandoah facility is the sort of work we are going after. ", "Clearly leveraging procurement deals, not just directs but indirects, are the sort of things we\u2019re taking a look at. We announced our North American supply chain optimization, which resulted in much more efficient use of our skills and talent. We don\u2019t need three engineering groups. We don\u2019t need three design groups and we\u2019re starting to push that as an opportunity. ", "So what\u2019s most exciting about the production, manufacturing, cost of goods work and resources for growth is it really spans all areas. It\u2019s not focused on one area. It\u2019s not focused on a couple of SKUs. It\u2019s really across the business, across all activities throughout the supply chain. ", "Joe Herak - Guttermer Research", "Okay. You had $50 million targeted for your packaging operations at Golden. How is that coming along?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Well. Again, we try to be really careful about what we say versus what we invest. I mean, the U.S. has done a great job in the last year and it has an exciting pipeline of ideas for \u201908 and \u201909 on packaging initiatives. So make no mistake -- as we save money on packaging, on line productivity, on line optimization, on plant scheduling, we also want to make sure that we are investing back in packages and liquids and ideas that our consumers and distributors and retailers can get behind and that\u2019s exactly what the U.S. business has and is doing. ", "Joe Herak - Guttermer Research", "What metrics are you guys using to measure success? Are you looking at RONA, ROE -- how are you guys making sure you stay number one in the industry with the right metrics in your manufacturing process?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Well, I\u2019ll defer to our supply chain folks and if you\u2019re talking about the U.S. to Peter Swinburn, but we look at COGS per barrel, we look at line rates, we look at efficiency rates, we look clearly at safety metrics because no amount of productivity is ever worth comprising the safety and health of our employees, so we look at all of that. Quality scores, we have a battery of important metrics that we look at not just in the U.S. but in the U.K. and Canada as well. ", "Joe Herak - Guttermer Research", "Okay, and final question; going forward for 2008 -- Leo, what would you like to tell all the shareholders on the call is your number one goal to reduce costs to make sure your stock price continues to go up, you stay number one in the industry, and you continue to provide the best brand for the value?", "Leo Kiely III", "You know, Joe, it\u2019s interesting -- it\u2019s really about engaging people. It\u2019s remarkable to me. I mean, we\u2019ve set some pretty high goals but once those goals are owned by our teams and rolled down to the people close to the action, we get ideas better than these stretched targets. So to me, it\u2019s really keeping our people focused, having them understand why we\u2019re so focused on costs to remain competitive, because it gives us the resources to invest in the top line and grow the bottom line at the same time. ", "And the more people get that, the more yield we see, plain and simple. So that\u2019s our game plan and we\u2019re staying with it. ", "Timothy V. Wolf", "And we will share the progress and resources for growth. Some of the ideas, the new ideas that have come to the fore and show you how that\u2019s working because we think, to Leo\u2019s point, by engaging people across the entire organization -- and it\u2019s G&A too. It\u2019s how we get more efficient in the back office as well as on the production floor. We think we\u2019ll have some more positive and encouraging things to share with you next month in New York. ", "Joe Herak - Guttermer Research", "Great. Thank you very much. Continued success down the road. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Thanks, everybody. Can you talk a little bit about the cost savings programs that have been planned, particularly in brewery optimization between the Coors and Molson merger and if anything has been put on hold between now and when the deal closes?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "I think you misspoke. I think you mean Miller and Coors?", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "No, actually I mean the old plants from Molson and Coors. ", "Timothy V. Wolf", "I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t understand your question. Absolutely, positively not. We, as you saw, we over-delivered by $25 million on our total resources for growth program separate from in addition to what we did with synergies in 2007 and as I shared in my remarks, we\u2019re going after $55 million more in 2008 on resources for growth. So absolutely, again on the production floor, procurement, back office, we are not slowing down our resources for growth for Molson Coors at all because of what may happen and the great opportunities that we see in the Molson Coors joint venture down the road. ", "Leo Kiely III", "We\u2019ve taken a point of view that no matter what our future is, these initiatives are right for our business. And in a sense, what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander. If this is right for our North American matrix, it\u2019s going to be right for the JV. And I am very impressed the way our teams have stayed focused because you\u2019re right -- there\u2019s a tendency to say why should we do this now and something else is coming. ", "The fact is we are out ahead of it, it sets the tone for the JV, gives us positive momentum for going into the JV and really tackling those synergy challenges with great momentum. So that\u2019s the posture we\u2019ve taken and the team is delivering. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Great, that\u2019s useful. And then quickly on Blue Moon, I noticed there\u2019s some print advertising out now. Is this a bit of a change in strategy or is Blue Moon so large now that it\u2019s going to require some media support going forward?", "Peter Swinburn", "No, no, we\u2019re not changing strategy on Blue Moon. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent with our approach. I mean, nothing remains exactly the same forever but the strategy is pretty consistent. That\u2019s exactly what we -- we plan to keep to that going forward because quite frankly, the sort of success we\u2019ve had with it, why on earth would you bother to change?", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Farkas from Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. Some follow-up questions on Canada, if I could, Kevin or maybe Tim; I\u2019m trying to reconcile your reported volume decline down 9.9% according to your press release and your reported sales up 9.2%. I think your price mix was up 4.5 points. Can you just talk a little bit about currency or other factors that would have driven that big swing in the top line?", "Leo Kiely III", "Kevin, you want to take shot at that?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Christine, I\u2019m having a hard time reconciling your numbers, to be honest. Can you go over your first nine and your second nine?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Well, the reported barrels on your press release show volumes down 9.9%. Is that actually incorrect? Because you talked about volumes down 3.8 excluding Foster\u2019s impact. ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Right. Okay, so -- okay. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "So was Foster\u2019s six points of volume, negative volume hit year over year?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "There\u2019s a -- you\u2019ve got to compared 14 weeks a year ago to 13 weeks this year, so 130,000 hectoliters I think there, and then the rest is Foster\u2019s. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "And your overall revenue per barrel growth was 4.5 points?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Right. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that included a couple points from mix?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Yes, it did. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and can you tell us maybe in dollars how much currency added to your Canadian top line?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "How much in -- in Canadian dollars?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, either points to growth or dollars, U.S. dollars would be fine. ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Okay, bear with me. We\u2019re going to grab that -- $17 million. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "On the top line? Okay. If I could just follow-up then with respect to a broader question on Canada, how is it progressing throughout the year, the overall mix impact from value brands growing faster than premium brands? Has that changed and how do you find your activities are working there?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "The value segment has actually stopped growing and is in a slight decline, so what you are seeing when you look, if you stand back and look at the whole market is you are seeing accelerated growth in the super premium and you are seeing the premium brands -- because remember it\u2019s done by what the regular retail price is, so as regular brands increase their discounting and you saw that throughout the course of all last year, they are still classified as premium brands, if you like. So that stunted the growth and actually turned the value segment into a decline. ", "So you are seeing some normalization there driven by the growth of the premium light segment but also the premium segment beginning to stabilize and the super premium continuing to outperform the whole market, clearly. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just moving lastly to the U.S., Peter, we\u2019ve head some comments from other beverage companies about slowing immediate consumption trends. Now your brands have performed very well and it may be less relevant to Molson Coors but can you talk about what you are seeing in perhaps some of the on-premise trends or other immediate consumption trends with respect to those channels in your brands?", "Peter Swinburn", "Yes, certainly. It really varies by market. Overall we are very comfortable with consumption trends, though we are seeing softer trends over in the Northeast. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg, Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Tim, on the free cash flow for \u201908, a couple of clarifications, if I could -- the 550 number is where you remain. If you think about that number in terms of what might be possible puts and takes against it besides the JV as you move through the year and besides, of course, an earnings view you might have that could obviously change but things like pension contribution, CapEx, some of the things historically we\u2019ve seen cause that number to be different than you thought at the beginning of the year. What are some of the items you\u2019re at least contemplating as notable -- as potential notable changes to that 550?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Good question. I mean, obviously our objective is to park it above the 550, right? I mean, that\u2019s -- but we want to make sure that we are flexible enough to be investing in ideas. You\u2019ll see that the guidance I gave on the CapEx, a plan of about $280 million, is a bit more than what we shared at the 250 level earlier last year, and so because when opportunities like a contract packing project with S&N in the U.K. arise and it\u2019s very, very high return, very attractive, we want to make sure we can fund that and go after it. ", "So discrete projects that have very attractive returns, that are cash positive, we\u2019re going to take a look at. So could the 280 be a little bit higher, a little bit lower? Certainly. That\u2019s one of them. Pensions -- perhaps, but as we\u2019ve been sharing, we\u2019ve made very significant pension contributions, we\u2019ve de-risked our pension asset allocations. We think we\u2019re pretty darn close -- again, you\u2019re never done but we are very, very far along in terms of being fully funded. ", "I think those are the two main areas where we\u2019ve had variability in the past, to your point, so I\u2019ve got to presume that\u2019s where we are going to see the most variability -- again, still within a pretty tight band in \u201908. ", "Restructuring opportunities -- I mean, you saw the great opportunity to close Edmonton. I can\u2019t think of anymore plants we\u2019re inclined to shutter but it\u2019s those sort of instances that when we have an opportunity, we\u2019re going to go after it. If it requires cash to restructure or improve or tighten, we\u2019re going to do it and of course we\u2019ll be forthcoming in details on how we do it and why we do it but it\u2019s business opportunities that we want to seize or momentum we want to chase that could cause us to alter that 550. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s great. Very helpful, Tim and if I could, same topic but if we bring the JV into the picture here and perhaps I missed this but if we think about the timing of the $450 million in CapEx that the total JV would invest to get the $500 million in savings, how are you thinking about the timing of that 450? I mean, is it particularly first year, second year? How does it weight among those three years?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Mark, just a couple of things -- first of all, the $430 million that we shared in New York in October and have been consistent since then is the total CapEx and restructuring costs, so restructuring and any write-offs, relocations, severance -- those sort of expenses costs, cash use, is also in there. ", "What we shared is we would be spending roughly $200 million plus or minus 10%, 15%. And again, the bulk of that CapEx is going to deliver logistics synergies and production synergies that we detailed by optimizing what will be an eight plant versus a two plant or a six plant supply chain footprint. ", "To your point, the best thing for the JV, the best thing for SABMiller value, the best thing for Molson Coors value, is to spend that money wisely but to spend it quickly because we would love to be in a situation, I think, and certainly wouldn\u2019t speak for our colleagues in Milwaukee, but think about the -- we\u2019d love to be in a position where most of if not all of the eight plants in the JV footprint are ready to rock and roll as one system as quickly as possible -- certainly, certainly in time for all of peak season \u201909 but maybe even a portion of \u201908. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. Thank you, Tim. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Banc of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Good morning, guys. Just a couple of follow-up questions; first, Tim, getting back to the free cash flow, any thoughts on the potential for share repurchases and also how you are thinking about your balance sheet now going forward, where repurchases, dividends, and acquisitions kind of stand?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Your second point first -- we like our balance sheet. You know, the tender that we just announced really in my mind kind of completes our three-year journey as we begin our fourth year of Molson Coors, of paying down all the debt that we can cost effectively pay down. We have said and will continue to repeat the soundness and solid funding of our pension plans in all three geographies. We have dispatched the Brazil investment just a year ago so overall we feel pretty darn good about our balance sheet and sure, you will see -- as you look at our K, you will see movements, much of which is triggered by FX. Obviously when you have an asset like the Canadian business and the Canadian currency does what it does, you are going to have some of the values really spiking up on you. But in terms of the overall health of the balance sheet, I think we all collectively feel really good about where we are, the financial strength that we have to go forward and do some great things over the next couple of years. That\u2019s point one. ", "Point two, in terms of disposition of free cash flow, don\u2019t forget -- I mean, again not to repeat myself but we\u2019ve been hard at work the last couple of years building plants, making pension contributions, paying down debt, and so now as we embark on \u201908, this will be a year where we don\u2019t have lots of earmarks, so to speak, for our $550 million. We\u2019ve begun, we\u2019ll continue a conversation with our board in terms of the right thing to do in terms of cash disposition but also acknowledge it\u2019s been -- you know, Leo\u2019s challenge to us, it\u2019s been our mantra that we want to invest money to become more competitive to make money and our first commitment is to the business to build it, and that free cash flow will help do that. ", "Certainly, certainly not ignorant or blind to the fact that our dividend hasn\u2019t moved in three years. I mean, we are clearly aware of that and that\u2019s part of the conversation that we would and will have with our board. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Would you think timing of that is -- is that conversation better had once you\u2019ve got the clarity on the JV closing? It\u2019s kind of hard to make that -- make those sorts of decisions until that happens. Is that fair to say?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "I think it\u2019s for our board to direct and counsel on timing. I think that would be premature and inappropriate of me to say it. I\u2019d be presumptuous in talking about timing. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, and then Leo, can you talk a little bit about the transition? Again, assuming that the JV is approved and you move into your new role, what the succession plan is now?", "Leo Kiely III", "You know, I think as we\u2019ve said before, we have a really robust succession dialog with our board you know, as evidenced by the way we are able to move behind the Frits van Paasschen departure this year, with Peter Swinburn moving to the U.S., Mark Hunter moving into the U.K., we really feel good about our leadership team. You know, this is obviously board work and the dialog will continue but I feel very confident we have the talent on board we need to move forward. ", "We won\u2019t announce any of the new team for the JV other than what\u2019s been announced. Until we have DOJ approval, it just wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. But in that sense too, we feel like we\u2019ve got tremendous depth as we head into this venture. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, and if I could, just one last question relative to the DOJ -- are you still providing information to the DOJ or have you pretty much provided everything they asked for?", "Leo Kiely III", "We\u2019re still in process. This is a -- you know, a process that just plain has a pace to it, you know? So we are still in document transfer. We are preparing white papers on key issues. We\u2019ll have executive interviews in the month of March, for example, so this is a process that\u2019s -- you know, we\u2019re just working our way through and frankly there aren\u2019t any tea leaves to read. ", "What we do feel positive about is we anticipate a decision early to mid-summer and we obviously think it\u2019s going to be a positive one. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. Thanks, guy. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Mr. Kiely, I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. ", "Leo Kiely III", "Thanks for being with us, everybody, and I appreciate your questions. I want to remind you that to win in the beer business, you have to grow, you have to make money, you have to have a great team, okay? And I think underlying our results this year, the investment in growth and the bang for the buck in our investments for growth is one of the things I\u2019m most excited about and building a team that\u2019s market-facing, brand led, and focused on bringing meaningful innovation to the market is the way we believe we\u2019ll win in the beer business. And obviously to do that, we\u2019ve got to grow the bottom line and have resources for those investments. That\u2019s our game plan. We\u2019re sticking with it. Really, thanks for being with us today. That\u2019s it, Matt. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Leo Kiely, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Sir, you may begin. ", "Leo Kiely III", "Thanks, Matt. Hello and welcome everybody and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call are: Tim Wolf, Kevin Boyce, Peter Swinburn, Mark Hunter, the CEO of our Coors Brewers Limited business; Dave Perkins, President of Global Brand and Market Development; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal Officer; Mike Gannon, our global Treasurer; Marty Miller, our global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "This morning Tim and I will take you through some highlights of our first quarter 2008 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on 2008, and then we will open it up for questions. ", "The first quarter of 2008 was a very strong quarter for our company, as we continued to achieve solid top-line and bottom-line performance. Let's start with some global highlights for the quarter: we grew Coors Light sales to retail more than 5% globally in the first quarter. ", "We achieved net sales growth of more than 10%, driven by brand strength, positive pricing, and the benefit of favorable foreign currency. We grew net pricing in all three of our major markets on the strength of our brands and the discipline of our sales teams. ", "We captured $29 million of cost reductions as part of our Resources for Growth program in the quarter. These cost reduction programs allowed us to offset more than 90% of our cost inflation in the quarter. We continued to invest with discipline and at a high level in our brands and our sales capabilities in each of our businesses. ", "We used cash on hand to pay down more than $180 million worth of high-rate senior notes during the quarter. And excluding special and other one-time items, we more than doubled our consolidated income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2008 to $59.1 million after tax. This substantial increase in underlying earnings was driven by strong sales growth by our brands, positive pricing, and cost savings that exceeded our goals, along with a lower tax rate.", "With our first quarter bottom-line results, we also achieved the profit target for our primary long-term incentive program. This performance-share program was designed to reward employees if the company met a stretch target for trailing four-quarter profit within a two-to-five-year period. ", "Due to the very strong performance of the company in the past year, we achieved this target in the first quarter of this year, which is the third year of the program. As a result, we recorded $25 million of accelerated expense for the program that was originally planned to flow over the balance of 2008. In fact, our earnings per share would have been $0.10 higher without the accelerated expense related to this program in the quarter. ", "It is a substantial accomplishment for this organization to grow underlying earnings 136% in a seasonably small profit quarter, even though nearly half of the total expense for this multi-year incentive program fell in the first quarter of this year. This speaks to the strength and the quality of our company's earnings performance in the quarter. ", "On the whole, we are pleased with our strong start to 2008. We are building a winning culture based on strong talent and a clear vision of becoming one of the best-performing beer companies in the world. We have more work to do but we are clearly moving in the right direction and we have made good progress to date. ", "At this point, I'll turn it over to Tim to review first quarter financial highlights and trends and then we'll provide some perspective on the balance of 2008, so Timothy.", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Thanks, Leo, and hello to everybody out there. I'll start with first quarter financial highlights. ", "In the quarter, we grew total-company volume 2.8% and net sales 10.4%. Gross profit increased $63.2 million, driving more than a full percentage point improvement in gross margin. Our operating margin of 6.3% excluding special items also increased more than a full percentage point from a year ago. On the bottom line, we achieved underlying after-tax earnings of $59.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the first quarter, which is up 136% from a year ago. ", "We will discuss our earnings performance today primarily in terms of underlying earnings, which is a common performance measure that excludes special and other one-time items from our U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all of the financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. Dollars. ", "Our first quarter underlying earnings exclude restructuring costs in the U.K., brewery closure costs in Canada, and expenses related to our proposed U.S. joint venture, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our company-owned distributorship in Boise, Idaho. We also exclude one-time debt extinguishment costs of $12.4 million, which we used to repurchase $180 million of our 6-3/8% senior notes that were due 2012. This debt tender made good sense because we had cash on hand from year end and saw good value in paying down high-cost debt, especially with short-term rates so low. ", "These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in more detail in the earnings news release we distributed this morning. ", "Net foreign exchange improvements increased our total-company pretax profit by approximately $4 million in the first quarter on an underlying basis, driven by the appreciation of the Canadian Dollar versus the U.S. Dollar. ", "Before I go through our business segment results, I want to share some changes in the way we are reporting our results this year.", "With the appointment of Dave Perkins to President of Global Brand and Market Development, results for our businesses in Asia, Latin America and Continental Europe are now included with our Corporate results in a new non-reportable segment called Global Markets and Corporate. Prior year results have been reclassified the same way for comparability.", "As a result, our U.S. segment now includes only U.S. and Puerto Rico results, and the Europe segment has been renamed and now includes only the U.K. and Republic of Ireland.", "In Canada, the new Modelo/Molson joint venture created at the beginning of this year and the loss of the Foster's U.S. production contract change our reported results in two ways: first, Modelo/Molson JV results are being reported under the equity method of accounting. When comparing current year results to prior year, this change will have the effect of reducing our reported sales volume, reported net sales per barrel, reported cost of goods per barrel and reported marketing expense. ", "Our 50% share of the joint venture earnings are included in Canada cost of goods sold. In addition, sales to retail and market share results will now include sales of Modelo products for all of Canada, where prior-year results did not include provinces west of Ontario. ", "Second, the loss of the Foster's U.S. production contract will drive lower reported sales volume and higher revenue and cost of goods per-barrel for the first three quarters of 2008. The loss of this contract has no effect on our STRs, since the Foster's U.S. production volume has never been included in our Canadian STRs. ", "These reporting adjustments reflect recent changes in the structure of our company. I'll provide more detail on the impact of these changes with the discussion of each business. ", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income of $64.1 million in the first quarter was nearly 42% higher than a year ago, driven by positive net pricing and a $9 million benefit from favorable foreign exchange. ", "Our Canadian sales to retail, or STRs, in the first calendar quarter ended March 31st increased 2.5% versus a year ago, driven by strong growth of our strategic brands and the addition of Modelo brands to our portfolio in Western Canada. ", "Coors Light continues to lead strategic brand growth with a double-digit increase in the quarter. Creemore, Carling and our partner import brands also maintained their double-digit growth rates, while Rickard's grew at a high-single-digit rate. Molson Canadian experienced only a slight volume decrease compared to the prior year. ", "On a comparable basis, excluding the addition of Modelo brands in Western Canada, our STRs grew 0.7% year over year.", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail grew an estimated 1.3% in the calendar first quarter. Our Canada market share increased approximately one-half share point compared to prior year due to the addition of the Modelo brands in the West. Excluding the addition of the Modelo volume in the West, our first quarter Canada market share declined approximately one-quarter of one share point.", "Our Canada sales volume totaled 1.5 million barrels for the fiscal first quarter ended March 30th, which was a decrease of 8.6% from a year ago. This decline was attributed entirely to two factors: first, the termination of the Foster's contract resulted in a 6% decline in current year volumes; second, the elimination of Canada sales volume for Modelo products, which drove a 3% decline compared to prior year, which also included sales volume for Eastern Canada. Excluding these two factors, comparable Canadian sales volume increased slightly over prior year. ", "Net sales per barrel increased 6.4% in local currency, with approximately 3% of the increase driven by positive pricing. The remaining increase is due to the positive effect of the Foster's contract termination on our sales mix.", "Cost of goods sold per barrel increased 2% in local currency in the first quarter due to 5 percentage points of commodity inflation, partially offset by a 3 percentage point  decrease from cost savings under our Resources for Growth initiatives, and we\u2019ll talk more about that in a moment. ", "Marketing general & administrative expense in the quarter decreased approximately 5% in local currency due to lower overheads from cost savings initiatives and amortization expense, along with the elimination of all Modelo brand costs, which are now managed by the joint venture. These savings were partially offset by the Canada portion of accelerated expense for long-term incentives.", "In the U.S., we continued to drive very strong growth  on both the top-line and bottom line. As a result, underlying pretax income grew 36% in the first quarter to $61.9 million. Our performance represents a significant improvement versus a year ago in our ability to convert sales momentum into earnings growth as pretax margin improved by nearly two full percentage points. ", "This substantial profit increase in the U.S. was the result of solid brand building and sales execution, positive pricing, volume leverage, cost reductions, and lower commodity inflation than we saw last year. The U.S. business delivered these strong results despite the accelerated expense for long-term incentives. Excluding incremental incentive costs, U.S. underlying pretax income would have increased more than 60%. ", "Looking at U.S. highlights, U.S. sales to retail, which includes Puerto Rico, increased 6.6% and we grew market share significantly in the first quarter. For the 50 states excluding Puerto Rico, for the 50 states sales to retail increased 7.1%. This increase was driven by mid-single-digit growth of Coors Light, and double-digit growth by Blue Moon, Keystone Light and Coors Banquet. ", "Each of our four largest brands achieved accelerated sales and market-share growth trends in the quarter. Equally important, the strength of our U.S. portfolio spanned the country, with sales-to-retail growth in 47 out of 50 states and in all major channels. In 15 states, our portfolio grew at double-digit rates. We also continued to expand distribution, with about 30,000 new placements of Coors, Coors Light and Keystone Light in the quarter. ", "U.S. volume, including Puerto Rico again, to wholesalers grew 7.4%. Net sales per barrel increased 3.4% in the first quarter, driven by 2.9 percentage points of positive net pricing, along with increased distributor fuel surcharges and new commercial sales from our U.S. can joint venture. ", "Cost of goods per barrel increased 1.6% in the quarter, driven by higher transportation and packaging material costs and tornado damage at our Memphis redistribution center. In addition, our Memphis redistribution center was damaged, as I say, by a tornado and that damage caused a one-time 0.7% increase to cost of goods sold per barrel. These increases were partially offset by cost savings. ", "U.S. marketing and G&A expense increased 9.6% in the first quarter, driven by accelerated expense from our long-term incentive plan. Our U.S. team continued to exceed its cost-reduction targets, as overall cost savings offset essentially all of the U.S. inflation in the first quarter. ", "Our U.K. business reported a $2.0 million pretax loss on an underlying basis. An increase in off-premise volume and supply chain savings, partially offset by higher pension costs and lower on-premise volume, drove a $700,000 improvement versus a year ago. ", "Our U.K. owned-brand volume increased 1% in the quarter, driven by a 17% increase in the off-premise channel. This strong volume growth was due to selective but more-visible promotional features, the Easter holiday falling in the first quarter, and customers buying in advance of a 9% increase in the beer excise tax. ", "On-premise volume declined approximately 8% as a result of the smoking bans enacted last year and challenging market conditions. The U.K. volume performance in the first quarter resulted in an increase in overall market share and in both the on- and off-premise channels.", "Net sales per barrel increased 4% in local currency, with about half due to higher pricing and half due to our acquisition of the Camerons on-premise distribution business in the middle of last year. In a challenging market, we achieved our fifth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth in owned-brand pricing. ", "Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency increased 4.6% in the first quarter, with approximately three percentage points of this change related to factored brand sales, including the Camerons acquisition. The balance of the increase was driven by higher pension costs and cost inflation, offset in part by cost savings initiatives. ", "Marketing, G&A expense in the U.K. increased 3.5% in local currency as a result of higher pension expense and overhead costs related to the Camerons business, again partially offset again by continued cost savings. Marketing costs were largely unchanged. ", "In Global Markets and Corporate, MG&A totaled $37.3 million in the first quarter, including Corporate G&A expense of $28.9 million. Corporate G&A increased about $8.3 million in the quarter, driven by higher long-term incentive plan expense this year. ", "Corporate net interest expense improved $2.5 million from a year ago, meaning lower, because of the debt restructurings we completed last year along with lower net debt balances this year. We achieved this reduction in net interest despite $5 million of additional interest expense due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates, primarily caused by a stronger Canadian Dollar. ", "The underlying loss for Global Markets and Corporate was $58.3 million pretax, which is  a 13.0% increase as a result of the additional incentive plan expense in the first quarter this year, we\u2019ve mentioned repeatedly. ", "Moving beyond operating performance and unit performance, our first quarter effective tax rate was negative 12% on a reported basis and positive 2% on an underlying basis. These rates are below our expected annual rate for 2008 because of the release of unrecognized tax benefits in the quarter as we closed or effectively settled some tax years. ", "The first quarter is generally a cash-use quarter because of the seasonality of the beer business. Free cash flow for the first quarter reflected a net cash use of $167 million, which was made up of $126 million of operating cash use, plus $28 million of proceeds from asset sales, less capital spending of $69 million. This free cash flow was $111 million improved versus the first quarter of 2007 due to higher net income and asset sales and lower capital spending this year versus last. ", "Total owned debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.96 billion, excluding approximately $110 million of non-owned joint venture debt. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $119 million at the end of the quarter, resulting in owned net debt of $1.84 billion. ", "Now I'll preface the outlook section as usual by paraphrasing our Safe Harbor language. Some of what we talk about now and in the Q&A may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what we project today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and proxy filings for a more-complete description of factors that could affect our projections. ", "We do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that we may discuss during the call, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. ", "Looking forward, we continue to anticipate 2008 corporate net interest expense of approximately $95 to $100 million on a foreign-exchange-neutral basis. This approximate $13 million reduction from last year is attributable to the debt repayments and restructurings we have undertaken in the past year to lower costs and strengthen our financial foundation.", "We still expect full-year 2008 corporate G&A expense of approximately $110 million, plus or minus 5%, which is in line with last year. ", "Turning to our effective tax rate, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2008 underlying tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 18%, and that excludes special and other one-time items, and that assumes no further changes in tax laws. With a rate of 2% in the first quarter, this implies an underlying tax rate in the range of 15% to 19% for the balance of this year. We expect our 2008 rate to be lower than our long-term range of 22% to 26% because of the release of unrecognized tax benefits in 2008. ", "Our capital spending outlook for 2008 remains approximately $280 million, and that excludes self-funded capital spending by our consolidated joint ventures. ", "We are on track to achieve our 2008 free cash flow goal of $550 million. Note also the completion of the Miller/Coors JV in the U.S. would likely change our outlook in some or all of these areas.", "Now, highlights of our cost-reduction initiatives, in our first quarter we captured an incremental $29 million of cost savings as part of our three-year, $250 million Resources for Growth cost reduction initiative. We are on target to achieve our 2008 goal of at least $77 million of additional cost savings and we have already delivered more than one-third of this annual goal in our first quarter. Equally important, we are confident that we will be able to achieve our goals for this 3-year program. ", "At this point, let me turn it back to you, Leo, for a look ahead at 2008 on our other businesses ", "Leo Kiely III", "Thanks, Tim. In 2008, we remain focused on building strong brands and reducing costs in each of our businesses. To keep our brand momentum going this year -- in Canada, we are building momentum in our strategic brands by rolling out innovative new packages, promotions and advertising creative in the year. Coors Light is receiving strong investment behind new ad creative and our Cold Certified campaign. ", "We expect the solid growth trends to continue on our super-premium owned brands -- that\u2019s Rickard's and Creemore -- including the continuation of our highly successful national rollout of Rickard's White. We will also focus on improving the performance of our Molson trademark brands throughout 2008 by introducing new advertising and innovation for Molson Canadian, Export and Dry. ", "Our super-premium partner-import brands continued their double-digit organic growth in the first quarter. Our new long-term joint venture to import, distribute and market the Modelo beer portfolio across Canada further strengthens that portfolio and provides enhanced share growth opportunities for us in Western Canada. ", "From a trade promotion standpoint, Quebec has started the year with considerable competitive activity. We remain committed to growing our strategic brands while ensuring that our portfolio remains competitive on a market-by-market basis.", "In the U.S., our strong volume and share growth continues, as does our delivery of substantial cost reductions. Coors Light, Keystone Light and Blue Moon will remain our national focus brands, and we intend to continue to leverage the momentum behind Coors Banquet to further expand distribution. We are also implementing programs to improve sales trends for Killian's and Molson Canadian. Our brands are strong and primarily play in healthy segments of the U.S. beer industry. ", "We will continue to drive sales and profit by bringing our Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment to more consumers and by extending our successful General Manager sales structure to the entire country by the end of this year. ", "Fully half of our U.S. growth last year on our largest brands was through successful increased distribution and we have plenty of headroom versus our competition to do the same again this year. We will also grow our Key Account business through increased category management for retailers, better alignment with our distributor network, and even more disciplined execution at retail. ", "Finally, we will continue to take a disciplined approach to pricing while building our core brand equities.", "In the U.K., we see 2008 as a year of two halves, with sales challenges related to the smoking bans and incremental pension expenses impacting the first half this year. In the second half, we anticipate that the smoking ban impacts will lessen as we cycle their implementation and several strategic wins will begin to improve our performance trends in the U.K. These strategic wins include the S&N contract brewing agreement, the Magners cider agreement, greater participation by our brands with major off-trade retailers, and positive pricing for our brands despite difficult industry conditions. ", "In addition, we continue to roll out our new cold-dispense technology for Carling with 12,000 installations in the first quarter, as well as \"Cold As You Can See\" thermo-chromatic packaging and our Compact Draught system. ", "Coors Light volume is also showing encouraging growth, driven by solid retail partnerships and an increasing consumer demand for lighter, more-refreshing beers.", "And finally, looking at the quarterly flow of pretax earnings, these factors yield a U.K. financial plan weighted to the back half of the year with a particularly difficult comparison expected in the second quarter. ", "Across the enterprise, there are a few additional considerations regarding volume for the balance of 2008. In the U.S., our sales to retail continue to be strong in the first four weeks of the second quarter, growing at a high-single-digit rate from a year ago. In 2008, our reported sales volume in Canada will be significantly affected by the termination of our Foster's U.S. production contract and the new Modelo/Molson joint venture that Tim mentioned earlier. ", "The termination of the Foster's contract will result in approximately four to six percentage points of lower reported sales volume in each quarter for the first three quarters of 2008. The effect in the fourth quarter of 2008 will be much smaller as we cycle the end of the contract in early October. ", "In addition, not reporting future sales volume of our new joint venture with Modelo will drive about three to five percentage points of lower sales volume in each quarter of 2008 versus the prior year.", "In Canada, our sales to retail in April, including Modelo brands for Canada, increased at a high-single-digit rate, driven by unseasonably warm weather. As always, it is difficult to call the full quarter based on only one month of results.", "In the U.K., we continue to face challenges from a weak economy, the impact of the credit crunch on consumer confidence, and smoking bans in England and Wales. The second quarter will also be adversely impacted by the timing of Easter and customers buying in advance of the beer excise duty increase, both of which benefited the first quarter.", "And In the first four weeks of the second quarter, our U.K. sales to retail have decreased at a double-digit rate from a year ago, due to difficult weather comparisons from last year and the year-over-year timing of Easter. ", "Regarding cost reductions, we are on track to meet or exceed our goals in 2008. Looking at the cost outlook by business, in Canada we now anticipate that our reported cost of goods per barrel will decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency for the full year 2008. Excluding the effect of the new Modelo/Molson joint venture, the loss of the Foster's contract, and the $8 million benefit of recycling prior-year foreign currency adjustments, we expect the cost of goods sold per barrel to increase at a low-single-digit rate.", "In the U.S., we continue to expect our 2008 cost of goods per barrel to increase at a low-single-digit rate. We are confident that we will meet or exceed our cost-reduction goals this year via Resources for Growth program even if the Miller/Coors joint venture is completed as expected around mid-year 2008. ", "We anticipate cost challenges in two main areas: first, based on the current outlook for commodities, we expect transportation and fuel costs to increase substantially in 2008, along with moderate increases in packaging material and agricultural commodity costs. ", "Second, we will have higher contract-packaging fees and a full year of Shenandoah brewery depreciation expense in 2008. This outlook excludes the proposed Miller/Coors joint venture.", "Our U.K. team will continue to attack costs and maximize the return on our production assets. We are targeting a substantial savings as part of the Resources for Growth program, driven by headcount reductions, supplier negotiations and improvements in supply chain efficiencies. ", "To summarize our results and our discussion today, our first quarter performance really highlights the profit and value-generation potential of this company, in effect delivering the promise of the Molson/Coors merger a little over three years ago. ", "We have been building competencies across the company to innovate, build brands, reduce costs to reinvest for growth, sharpen profit and cash generation disciplines, and strengthen our financial foundation. ", "These improvements have generated solid results in recent quarters and they show that our company is much stronger now than three years ago. Equally important, our results show that this is a business with great potential to build brands and flow profit and cash for our shareholders. ", "And we are not done yet -- our next step is to gain regulatory approval for our U.S. joint venture with SABMiller and then successfully integrate our respective U.S. operations. We continue to target mid-year 2008 for completion of the U.S. JV, and we will keep you informed as we make progress. ", "Following completion of the JV, Tim and I and the rest of the new Miller/Coors leadership team will focus on the U.S., and Molson Coors will forge ahead with a strong vision and a deep pool of talent to take the company to the next level. ", "We are more excited than ever about the future for the Molson Coors Brewing Company, as we strive to become a top-performing global brewer. ", "Now, before we start our Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment -- our prepared remarks will be on the website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, our Investor Relations team, led by Dave Dunnewald, will host a follow-up conference call, essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast and recorded replay on our website.", "So, Matt, at this point let\u2019s open it up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Leo or Peter, I didn\u2019t catch if Peter was there but obviously U.S. momentum is very good here, and you mentioned the opportunity for added distribution gains. Could you be a little -- give us a little more detail on the opportunity for added distribution? And as you think of some of the markets that are doing well but not as strong as that double-digit of the 15, are there some markets that you think that are of size that have some near-term opportunity to get to that even stronger rate of growth we are seeing for those 15?", "Peter Swinburn", "First of all on distribution, I think we quoted a figure of about 30,000 year-to-date, which is where we are, and I think at the analyst review back in March, we said that about 50% of last year\u2019s growth came from distribution. I\u2019m not going to give you a [inaudible] in terms of quoting a number but suffice to say that we know AB within the competitive set of Keystone Light and Coors Light have something like 600,000 to 800,000 more placements than we do, so we see continued opportunity in the distribution both this year and going forward for our key brands. ", "In terms of the markets that are not in double-digit growth, you\u2019ve really got to balance that out between percentage increase and volume momentum. And what we are really interested in is seeing good momentum in all of our markets and looking to gain share in all of our markets. And presently, we are doing really well on that front. So it really is a -- it\u2019s a market by market share gain that we are looking for and as I said, we are doing very well on all of those fronts and across all of the channels as well. So hopefully that gives you the answer you required. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yeah, very helpful. Thank you, Peter. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony [Bucalla] from Credit Suisse.", "Anthony Bucalla - Credit Suisse", "The question is for Peter, along a similar line as Mark\u2019s question -- you said you had 15 states where you had double-digit growth in the brand portfolio, correct?", "Peter Swinburn", "Correct. ", "Anthony Bucalla - Credit Suisse", "Are those states where you are traditionally strong or are they states where you are generally under-indexed relative to your national share?", "Peter Swinburn", "It\u2019s a complete mix. ", "Anthony Bucalla - Credit Suisse", "Any more detail than that?", "Peter Swinburn", "Well, really no, I mean, without giving you market by market exactly what we are doing. We are performing very well in some markets in the east coast, where you know we are traditionally strong. We are performing exceptionally well in some places in the central part of the Midwest and also in the west, so it is -- in the west, we\u2019re strong as well. In the Midwest, historically we\u2019ve not been as strong. So it is a complete mix. I\u2019m not trying to avoid the question. ", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Just to follow on, I mean, think about the math of what Peter is talking about. For 47 out of 50 states, on average to pull through 7.1% growth -- now again, this is just the 50 states excluding Puerto Rico, you\u2019ve got to have a very, very healthy and right skewed distribution, right? I mean so -- we can talk about angels on a pinhead in terms of which states do what but the overall distribution of those 47 states is very, very healthy around that 7%. Some were a little bit lower, but not a lot lower, and you have a full one-third of those 47 states operating above 10%. ", "So just a really, really strong portfolio, if you will, of states. ", "Anthony Bucalla - Credit Suisse", "So there is no one particular state that you would highlight as a strong market -- it\u2019s sort of a portfolio?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "I think that\u2019s what Peter is saying, yeah. ", "Anthony Bucalla - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and just a quick question for Tim -- it looks like there may be some rules changes as it pertains to convertible debt, some accounting changes. What do you expect to see in your P&L next year if you are in a position to do some gymnastics on that?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Our friends at FASB are always at work on our behalf. If indeed that happens, and it looks like it will, that amortization of the as if interest expense would impact the expense line. Understand that it is non-cash; understand it doesn\u2019t affect the fundamental economics and the wisdom retrospectively and prospectively of us having done that financing, and so yeah, from an accounting basis, it would be a hit to the P&L but nothing of any significance. ", "Anthony Bucalla - Credit Suisse", "Okay, so you are not expecting to give any sort of guidance on how to account for this in the P&L next year?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "No, I mean we\u2019ll -- as we finish up this year and we look at our plans for 2009, we\u2019ll be happy to do that and the reason why it makes no sense to do that now is I think we\u2019d want to see where our cash balances are, toward the end of this year we want to see what investment rates on invested cash look like. I think it would be premature to give you a number but again, I think the most important point, with great respect to the accounting, this won\u2019t affect the fundamental economics of that really good financing. ", "Anthony Bucalla - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thank you very much and congratulations on a good quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Banc of America. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions -- first, in the U.K. you talked a bit about the impact of the smoking bans and I guess Leo, can you just talk a little bit about -- has the U.K. reacted -- has the lag or the time it\u2019s taken for demand to normalize been a little bit longer for some reason in the U.K. than you\u2019ve seen in some other markets? ", "Leo Kiely III", "That\u2019s really hard to compare. I think we are right in the middle of it in the U.K. and we\u2019ve seen tremendous variability within state to state within the United States and we are seeing that in Canada. But Mark, I think you can give some perspective within the U.K. markets. ", "Mark Hunter", "Really just to build on Leo\u2019s point, there\u2019s a number of things which are impacting the U.K. market performance. The smoking ban is one. As we come out of the first quarter of this year, the timing of Easter and obviously the magnitude of the excise duty increase that the government imposed, so all of those things are in the mix, so it is very difficult to call. ", "Our assessment is that particularly within on-premise, the underlying rate of decline of the market, which had been running at around about 4% or 5% has increased by two to three percentage points, so the market has been running at around about 8%. But it is really going to be August/September of this year before we start to see probably the new base for in particular the on-premise and the beer industry. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "And Mark, on the excise tax increase, has most of that been passed through? Have retailers passed that through to consumers directly?", "Mark Hunter", "I can\u2019t talk for what everybody has done but certainly at the Coors business in the U.K., that excise increase has been passed through to all of our customers. Those customers will then decide how they want to deal with that within their premises but we are certainly seeing -- we certainly saw pricing appear to harden within the off-premise channel. It looks like it\u2019s got a little bit competitive again in the last couple of weeks. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, and then Leo and Tim, just as you hopefully will begin spending most of your time focused on the U.S., you know, it\u2019s been probably 30 years since you\u2019ve seen an environment that has been this inflationary, especially harsh on wholesalers, given where fuel costs are. Can you talk a little bit about how the -- just the longevity, the length of this inflationary environment, what toll you think it\u2019s taking on wholesalers right now, and do you suspect or do you think that it is going to drive maybe further consolidation of the wholesaler tier or cause some other changes to the way wholesalers approach the business, just given their costs have been rebased so much higher in the last two years. ", "Leo Kiely III", "There\u2019s no doubt this is a significant impact on our wholesalers but you know, the wholesalers are resilient characters as well, however. And I think this will inevitably bring pressure, continued pressure, I\u2019m not sure increase but continued pressure, on consolidation at the wholesale level. You know, something we believed for a long time is that well-resourced and obviously well-managed wholesalers are real assets to all brewers and in our sense, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been pro-consolidation for probably the past 10 or 12 years. ", "Some escalation of the pressure there but I don\u2019t -- frankly, I don\u2019t see anything way unusual about the wholesaler reaction in this environment right now. They are hunkering down and have an incentive to sell more beer. ", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Bryan, I guess the other thing I might add is obviously our JV is not being formed because of inflation, but it could not happen at a better time because by bringing two great companies together and in effect reducing distance traveled from brewery to market, it will decline by about a third, a little less than a third for all Miller products, all Coors products. We are going to do everything we can to reduce the costs that either of the companies separate would have incurred. That\u2019s call synergies, right? So we are going to be hard about that work and our objective will be to meet or exceed the committed $500 million of synergies and that couldn\u2019t happen at a better time. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Great. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, everyone. Leo, a couple of questions on the JV, I\u2019m just wondering if you have any update on the timing of when you would expect a decision from the DOJ? I think there is a lot of chatter out there that we could get a decision by the end of this month. So I\u2019m wondering if you have any clarity on the timing. ", "Leo Kiely III", "No, we are smack in the middle of the process, Judy. Very few tea leaves to read. As we\u2019ve reported before, we anticipate clearance in the middle of the year and I would say we are still there. Meanwhile, we are doing everything possible we can to get off to a fast start within the guidelines of what are appropriate and frankly staying very focused on selling beer.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then with both you and Tim moving over to the JV, I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything to read in terms of the future corporate structure in thinking about the Coors management really moving over to the new JV and you are left with Molson Coors management that has -- I\u2019m just wondering if there is anything to read in terms of both you and Tim moving over to the JV. ", "Leo Kiely III", "No, I don\u2019t think so at all, Judy. Look, we\u2019ve -- in many ways, this merger of Miller and Coors in the U.S. is delivering the strategy we set out three years ago for Molson Coors. And you know we said that our first priority was really to firm up the performance in our core markets so that we could take Molson Coors on to the destiny we believed at the time of the merger. ", "Frankly, I think we\u2019ve got a terrific management team here and our depth of management is very good. We have a robust succession process with our board, so I think the baton pass here is going to be very clean and just very excited about the future of Molson Coors. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then Tim, I have a question on where you are on your decision of using the step-up in the free cash flow this year. I know at the analyst meeting you wanted to get a little bit more clarity in terms of the CapEx requirement for the JV. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve finalized that number and at this point we\u2019re closer to getting some kind of an announcement on the use of cash .", "Timothy V. Wolf", "Judy, thanks for the question. I am astounded I got the question. I\u2019m just kidding. No, you were kind to raise it and I don\u2019t have an update for you today. Needless to say we have traveled further in time so we\u2019ve got more clarity than obviously we did at the beginning of March. We are still working it and we will continue to have the conversation with our management team and our board and certainly are very sensitive to and aware of the sort of issues that you and others have raised, and we\u2019ll continue to work it here and if and when we have a decision, we will certainly communicate it in a timely fashion. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "And then my last question for Kevin -- if you look at Canada, the FTR excluding Modelo was up 0.7%. You talked about losing a little bit of share in the first quarter, as well as a step-up in competitive activity in Quebec. Can you just talk about that and how that sort of translated into your share performance in the first quarter and how we should think about your share trends for the balance of the year?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "If you look at historically we\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about Ontario, so I\u2019ll just start there, where we had less activity in terms of discounting and absolute number of activations, if you like, or weeks on sale this year versus last year. Quite a substantial reduction, actually, so we are very encouraged in Ontario by our share performance and nationally, when you look at it, considering the amount of pricing that we got to hold relative to the discounting in the marketplace, we actually think it\u2019s a good tribute to the strength of our brands. ", "What you are seeing in Quebec is our major competitor has actually increased their discounting in the first quarter and that continues into the second quarter in the face of some share losses they\u2019ve experienced. We\u2019ll obviously continue to intelligently drive our strategic brand growth and react on a market-by-market basis. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and just clarification -- you said revenue per barrel was up 6.4% in Canada?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Correct. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "And how much of that was mix versus -- ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "About half of it is pricing and about half of it is really the change in the Fosters business, if you like, and the fact that we no longer have it, which was a negative impact on NSR. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Three points of pricing, that includes also the mix benefit from the growth of the import portfolio as well?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Most of it is pricing, so the vast, vast majority of that 3% is pricing. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks a lot, guys. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Christine Farkas from Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Keeping with Canada just for a second, Kevin, given the economy and given the discounting that you are seeing in Canada, can you add a little bit of color on whether or not there are now category -- or are there any category mix shifts going on? It sounded like it improved in \u201907. Are you seeing a reversal of that trend to value?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "No, actually the value segment -- and part of it is probably the way that we look at the value segment, it\u2019s brands at their normal price, so if you discount say a Canadian into a lower price, we still consider it a premium business, if you like. But the value segment continues to decline on a national basis and we have seen some resurgence of the premium segment as they\u2019ve been a little bit keener in pricing. ", "So I think what you\u2019ve seen in the first quarter was pretty predictable. It\u2019s a little bit of jockeying as the companies are trying to figure out what\u2019s going to happen the rest of the year. ", "I would say compared to previous year across the country, price increases have come a little bit earlier. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great, and then moving to the U.S., again with the economy, can you talk maybe a little bit, Peter, about the trends in the C stores or on-premise here -- has there been any acceleration in that traffic, or deceleration in that traffic?", "Peter Swinburn", "Sure, Christine. Two sort of answers -- first of all, as far at the overall industry is concerned, then yes, we have seen -- we\u2019ve seen a downturn in the on-premise, which has been probably the most significant change. No other real significant movements. As far as we are concerned, we\u2019ve not really experienced any change in our trends from last year. We continue to have quite a strong showing in all channels, specifically in drugstore and convenience and specifically in the restaurant channel in the on-tray, so our on-tray business continues to do well. ", "If you look at our individual brands, we are not seeing any significant changes within those brands either, so Keystone Light continues to grow at double-digit rates, which is very much in line with where it was last year. Coors light continues to be strong and certainly hasn\u2019t come off last year\u2019s momentum. And at the other end of the spectrum, Blue Moon again is still in high-double-digits, so we are not really seeing anything within our brands that would suggest either trading out or trading down. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "And then if you were to extrapolate or isolate the distribution gains in your brand, and you look at really just the core brands year-over-year or apples-to-apples basis, would you similarly that the growth is very much intact there across channel?", "Peter Swinburn", "Yeah, we are seeing velocity -- I mean a come-back to the on-premise and we are seeing significant distribution growth but in the quarter, we also saw velocity growth for all our brands, including Coors Light and for Coors Light, that was the first velocity growth that we\u2019ve seen for the last eight quarters. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then a couple of questions for Tim -- the accelerated long-term incentive expenses, could you split that for us? Was it just in the U.S. and global or did that hit all segments?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "No, it hit all segments. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "And would you have a dollar amount just roughly of the $25 million how much of that was in the U.S.?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "The U.S. was about half of it. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Half, and would you -- based on your comments, it sounds like there is more of this to come in the remaining quarters of \u201908, did I hear you correctly?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "No, we are done with this multi-year program and my anticipation, and Leo can probably handle this better than I, but is the Molson Coors comp committee would probably be inclined to begin another cycle but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got detail on what that\u2019s going to look like. But again, if you go back in time three years ago, we anticipated that this very tough target would take circa three, four plus years to achieve. And originally we thought this would be achieved maybe in mid late \u201909 and as our businesses have gotten stronger and stronger, we\u2019ve taken costs out, our momentum has accelerated, we realized that we would be hitting it in this quarter, which we did, and so that pushed basically three to four quarters worth of expense into this first quarter. ", "So for this program, no more this year. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that\u2019s done. And then finally in Canada, that JV equity income now, can you just remind us, the volumes come out of your top line but the JV equity income, that comes in through your operating income in Canada or other income -- where does that come in?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "It comes in operating income and the cost of goods. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "And the cost of goods? ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "In the cost of goods, yeah. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. ", "Leo Kiely III", "Essentially it\u2019s in the margin. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then just a clarification, Tim, in terms of the buy-back plans or potential buy-back plans for Molson Coors; are you essentially waiting for the Miller Coors venture to be approved and looking at your overall statements before making a decision, or could this be a separate decision for your board?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "No update right now. I mean, we\u2019ve gotten some of the markers that we said we wanted to collect in March in terms of CapEx spending and overall cash performance. I think we are on track with our analysis but we have some more bases to touch before we take a decision. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. The first question, I think I just missed it but Leo, did you give an update on April STRs for the U.S.?", "Leo Kiely III", "I did. Tim, what was that number?", "Timothy V. Wolf", "The U.S. number was a high-single-digit. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Okay, thanks. And then the next question on the distribution increases, was there a period of time last year, maybe a quarter, where distribution really started to accelerate? And mainly I\u2019m asking to see if we are going to come into a period where you start to lap that and it\u2019s difficult to get incremental distribution from that point forward. ", "Peter Swinburn", "The distribution gains for last year were probably -- yeah, they were weighted, sorry, not probably -- they were weighted into the second and third quarters, so in terms of lapping those, yes we are but I would still come back to the main point I made earlier, and that is that there\u2019s really significant headroom for us in terms of distribution compared to the competitive set certainly if you use Anheuser-Busch as the main driver of distribution in their brands. So we\u2019ve got plenty of headroom so lapping really isn\u2019t an issue for us. There\u2019s lots for us to go for. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Okay, and then maybe if you could help us a little bit on what\u2019s behind the distribution gains. Is it that the key account program is now three years -- you know, it\u2019s been about three years and it\u2019s got some momentum? Or is it that the brands are very strong in a few regions and then other regions are picking it up? Could you maybe help us with what\u2019s behind -- ", "Peter Swinburn", "Sure I can and the latter point is probably the correct one. It\u2019s not isolated to certain channels or certain geographies. This is happening right across the piece, so yes, our national account structure that we put in some years ago is really beginning to gain momentum now but equally, the brands -- and I think we quoted it in the release that we gave you -- over 90% of our portfolio is growing, so when you\u2019ve got momentum like that, gaining distribution with retailers becomes much easier, confidence in the distributors to put these brands into distribution, new SKUs into distribution is really high because they are not concerned about having to pick it up at a later date. ", "So we really are increasing distribution across geographies and channels and brands. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Okay, great. And then last thing for the U.S. and for Canada, if you could give us your views on the consumer and how you feel about the price increases that have gone through and whether the consumer can handle it, given what we are hearing related to the economy. ", "Peter Swinburn", "I\u2019ll take it first, if you like. I can only tell you where we are. I mean, you\u2019ve seen our net sales revenue figures and you\u2019ve seen what portion of that is pricing that\u2019s gone into the market and you\u2019ve seen our volume sales. So I think really that answers the question. ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "I think from our standpoint, we did take pricing, as I mentioned earlier, earlier in the year than perhaps previous years. There\u2019s been a lot of reports in newspapers about some of the brewers, particularly the small brewers, facing increased pressure. I think right now, the pricing that has gone into the marketplace has been relatively well-received.

Boyce - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Canada", "Analysts", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Analyst for Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Molson Coors Brewing Company 2008 second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Peter Swinburn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Sir, you may begin. ", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Thanks, Matt. Hello and welcome to everybody. Thanks for joining us today. With me on the call are: Kevin Boyce, CEO of Molson Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Coors Brewers Limited; Sam Walker, our global Chief Legal Officer; and Dave Dunnewald, Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "I also want to introduce two new leaders on our global finance team who are on the call with us today. First, Stewart Glendinning is our new Molson Coors' CFO. Stewart comes to the global team from his role as CFO of our U.K. business. Prior to that, Stewart held leadership roles in global audit and finance consulting firms. ", "Secondly, Bill Watters joined the global team as Controller in June, moving over from his role as CFO of our U.S. business. Bill has more than 15 years of finance and accounting experience with our company in the U.S. and overseas. ", "On the call today, Stewart and I will take you through some highlights of our second quarter 2008 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of the year. Then we will open it up for questions. ", "So let\u2019s get started -- with the creation of Molson Coors, we accomplished the most significant business combination in the history of U.S. beer. This new venture fundamentally changes the game in the U.S. beer industry by creating a stronger and more competitive company with the talent, brands, and scale to win in this critical market. ", "Molson Coors is bringing new energy to the beer industry and will drive additional profitable growth for Molson Coors Brewing Company. This in turn provides important new financial resources for us to continue building our brands in our core markets and around the world. ", "Turning to financial performance in the second quarter, we benefited from another exceptional quarter by our U.S. business, which achieved gains in sales volume and pricing and double-digit underlying earnings growth. Maintaining this strong momentum is particularly exciting as we launch Molson Coors. ", "On a company-wide basis, our top brands continued to outperform the industry in the second quarter and we achieved net pricing gains and substantial cost savings in each of our core markets. At the same time, however, energy costs and commodity inflation have become bigger challenges for our company and for the global beer industry. This cost inflation, combined with a higher tax rate, drove lower underlying earnings for our total company in the second quarter. ", "In the face of these challenging economic conditions, we continue to implement value-added strategies that will allow us to build our brands, achieve positive pricing, reduce costs, and grow profits and cash for our shareholders. ", "Let\u2019s review some total company performance highlights for the quarter. We grew Coors Light sales to retail nearly 4% globally. We achieved net sales growth of 4.8%, driven by brand strength, positive pricing, and the benefit of favorable foreign currency. We grew net pricing in all three of our major markets on the strength of our brand building efforts. We captured $18 million of cost redemptions as part of our resources for growth program in the quarter. ", "These cost reduction programs allowed us to offset nearly a third of our cost inflation in the quarter. Excluding special and one-time items, underlying income from continuing operations declined 2% to $172.6 million in the second quarter, due to a higher effective tax rate in the quarter, which Stewart will discuss in a few minutes. And I\u2019m now going to pass it over to Stewart to review the second quarter financial results and trends, and then we\u2019ll cover the outlook for the rest of 2008. Stewart, over to you. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter and hello, everyone. I\u2019ll start with the second quarter financial highlights. We grew total company volume 0.9% and net sales 4.8%. Meanwhile, our underlying pretax income grew 2.5% in a challenging cost environment. ", "On the bottom line, underlying after-tax earnings of $172.6 million, or $0.93 per diluted share in the second quarter were 2% lower than a year ago. ", "We will discuss our earnings performance today primarily in terms of underlying earnings, a common performance measure that excludes special and other one-time items from our U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars. ", "It is important to note that our second quarter underlying earnings exclude $103.9 million of special items. Nearly half of this total was a $50.6 million non-cash charge to reduce the carrying value of the Molson brands sold in the U.S. The remaining items are virtually all cash charges that offer attractive returns on investment, including expenses associated with the formation of Molson Coors, restructuring costs in the U.K., and transition costs related to an outsourcing contract. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in more detail in the earnings news release we distributed this morning. ", "Foreign exchange movements increased our total company pretax profit by approximately $6 million in the second quarter on an underlying basis, driven by an 8% year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. ", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income of $154.4 million in the second quarter was 5.6% higher than a year ago, driven by an $11 million benefit from favorable foreign currency. Positive net pricing was offset by fuel and commodity price inflation and lower comparable Canada market volume. ", "As we discussed last quarter, the new Modelo Molson import joint venture and the loss of Foster\u2019s U.S. production contract affect the way that we report our Canada results this year in the following ways. ", "First, the loss of Foster\u2019s contract has the effects through the end of the third quarter of reducing reported sales volume about four to six percentage points while increasing net sales per barrel about three to four percentage points and increasing cost of goods sold per barrel about two to three percentage points. The effects in the fourth quarter this year are not significant as we cycle the October 2007 contract termination. The negative impact on pretax profits in the first three quarters of 2008 is about $1 million per quarter. Finally, the loss of this contract has no impact on our STRs, since the Foster's U.S. production volume has never been included in our Canada STRs.", "Second, the new Modelo Molson arrangement has the effect of reducing our reported sales volume, net sales per barrel, cost of goods per barrel and marketing expense because of the change to equity accounting. Our 50% share of the joint venture earnings are included in Canada cost of goods sold. In addition, sales to retail and market share results will now include our half of Modelo product sales for all of Canada.", "As I discuss Canada results, I will provide year-over-year changes that exclude the reporting effects of Foster's and Modelo Molson in order to provide more-comparable results. So, let's review the highlights.", "Our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the second calendar quarter ended June 30th decreased 0.8% on a comparable basis versus a year ago, driven by unusually wet weather in key major markets during the quarter. Molson's strategic brands, which represent more than 85% of our Canada STRs, continued to grow, including mid-single-digit growth by Coors Light and double-digit growth by Rickard's, Creemore, Carling, and our partner import brands. Molson Canadian experienced a mid-single-digit volume decrease compared to the prior year.", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail declined an estimated 0.7% in the calendar second quarter. On a comparable basis, our second quarter estimated Canada market share was virtually even with a year ago.", "Our Canada sales volume on a comparable basis decreased 1.1% versus prior year.", "Comparable net sales per barrel increased approximately 3% in local currency, driven almost entirely by positive pricing, along with a small increase from partner-import brand growth.", "Cost of goods sold per barrel in the second quarter increased 9% on a comparable basis in local currency when we exclude the impact of the Foster's and Modelo changes, as well as the benefit of cycling a $5.8 million unfavorable foreign currency adjustment last year. This underlying cost of goods increase was due to the net effect of three factors: an 8% increase driven by higher commodity and packaging material costs, along with increased energy and transportation costs; second, a 2.5% decrease from our Resources for Growth cost savings initiatives; and third, a 3.5% increase due to higher fixed overhead costs and the ongoing shift in sales mix to partner import brands.", "Comparable marketing general & administrative expense in the quarter decreased 6.4% in local currency driven by results of our costs savings initiatives and lower amortization and administrative expenses.", "Other income decreased $17.5 million in the second quarter primarily due to the cycling the $16.7 million gain on the sale of our interest in the House of Blues Canada business during the second quarter of 2007. This non-recurring gain was excluded from our underlying non-GAAP earnings for the second quarter of 2007.", "In the U.S., second quarter underlying pretax income increased 14.8% to $112.7 million. This increase was driven by strong sales volume growth and positive net pricing, partially offset by higher transportation and packaging material costs. ", "Looking at highlights: U.S. sales to retail increased 5.1%, yielding solid market share growth in the quarter. Our U.S. STR growth would have been about two percentage points higher without the impact of a shift in the year-over-year timing of the July 4th holiday within our fiscal calendar. This strong sales performance was driven by mid-single-digit growth by Coors Light, high-single-digit growth by Coors Banquet, and double-digit growth by Blue Moon and Keystone Light. Each of our four largest brands achieved accelerated sales and market-share growth trends in the quarter. ", "For the second consecutive quarter, we grew sales-to-retail in all major channels and in 47 out of 50 states, a geographic base that represents over 96% of our total U.S. volume. We also continued to expand distribution, with more than 70,000 new SKU placements of Coors Light and Keystone Light in the quarter.", "U.S. volume to wholesalers growth of 7.0% was not significantly affected by the timing of the July 4th holiday.", "Net sales per barrel increased 3.8% in the second quarter, driven by three percentage points of higher net pricing, along with increased distributor fuel surcharges and new commercial sales from our U.S. can joint venture. Excluding the commercial can sales, net sales per barrel increased 3.3%.", "Cost of goods per barrel increased 4.9% in the quarter, driven by higher fuel, transportation and packaging material costs, as well as commercial can sales. Excluding the impact of commercial can sales, cost of goods per barrel increased 4.1%. ", "Price increases and cost savings more than covered the significant cost of goods inflation we saw in the quarter. Cost savings initiatives alone offset more than one-third of our U.S. cost of goods inflation in the quarter.", "U.S. marketing, general & administrative expense increased 6.6% in the second quarter, driven equally by increased sales and marketing spending and incentive compensation related to strong performance in the first half of the year. ", "All in, our U.S. business entered Miller Coors with strong volume and pricing momentum and with continued cost control, all of which allowed the business to again achieve double-digit profit growth, despite higher cost inflation.", "Moving to our U.K. business, second quarter underlying pretax income was $21.5 million, a decrease of $19.0 million from a year ago, primarily due to higher levels of input inflation, increased pension costs and lower sales volume.", "Our U.K. owned-brand volume outperformed the market in both the on- and the off-premise channels. However, volumes decreased 2.6% year-on-year due to the smoking bans, Easter falling in the first quarter, and customers buying in advance of the 9% increase in the beer excise tax in the first quarter. ", "Volumes in the off-premise channel grew by 6% as a result of selective but more-visible promotional features, but volumes in the on-premise declined 9%.", "Net sales per barrel increased 3.4% in local currency, predominantly due to our acquisition of the Camerons on-premise distribution business in July last year. Comparable net sales per barrel of our own products increased 0.6%, driven by higher on-premise pricing. This represents our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in owned-brand pricing.", "Cost of goods sold per barrel in local currency increased 11.9% in the second quarter, due primarily to higher Camerons factored brand sales, energy and materials cost inflation, and higher pension expense. More than half of this increase was driven by higher input cost inflation and pension expense.", "Marketing, general & administrative expense in the U.K. decreased 0.8% in local currency. General and administrative expense increased due to the addition of the Camerons business and higher pension costs. Excluding these year-over-year changes, our overhead costs declined in the quarter. Marketing expense in the quarter decreased as a result of reductions in spending to match the trading environment. ", "In global markets and corporate, excluding the reporting effect of changing our Mexico business to a license arrangement this year, global markets grew volume more than 13% and increased investments in our developing markets around the globe, including China and Europe. MG&A totaled $35.1 million in the second quarter, including corporate general and administrative expense of $25.9 million, which was $3.7 million lower than a year ago.", "Corporate net interest expense declined $1.8 million from a year ago because of the benefit of debt restructurings we completed last year, along with lower debt balances this year. These reductions were partially offset by nearly $3 million of incremental interest expense due to year-over-year foreign exchange movements.", "The underlying loss for global markets and corporate was $57.1 million pretax in the second quarter, a 3.4% decrease as a result of lower corporate G&A and interest expense this year. ", "Moving beyond operating business unit performance, our second quarter effective tax rate was 23% on a reported and underlying basis. This quarterly rate is higher than we expected earlier in the year, which I will discuss in a minute. Free cash flow for the second quarter reflected a net cash generation of $225 million, which was made up of positive operating cash of $287 million plus $5 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus capital spending of $67 million. This free cash flow result represents a $133 million improvement this year due to both lower capital spending and higher operating cash flow versus the second quarter of 2007.", "Total owned debt at the end of the second quarter was $1.96 billion, excluding approximately $118 million of non-owned joint venture debt. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $284 million at the end of the quarter, resulting in owned net debt of $1.68 billion. ", "Now, I'll preface the outlook portion of this call as usual by paraphrasing our Safe Harbor language. Some of what we talk about now and in the Q&A may constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what we project today, so please refer to our most recent 10-K, 10-Q and proxy filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect our projections. ", "We do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. ", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that we may discuss during the call, please visit our website, www.molsoncoors.com, for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.", "Looking forward, we continue to anticipate 2008 corporate net interest expense of approximately $100 million to $105 million on a reported basis. We expect full-year 2008 corporate general and administrative expense of approximately $110 million, plus or minus 5%, which is in line with last year and our previous guidance.", "Turning to our effective tax rate, we now anticipate that our underlying tax rates for full-year 2008 and for the second half of the year will be in the range of 20% to 24%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. This 2008 guidance is higher than we provided on our last earnings call because we now expect the closing or settling of certain tax years to be delayed until 2009. As a result, we also expect our 2009 effective tax rate to be below our long-term range of 22% to 26%.", "Note that we do not expect the completion of Miller Coors in the U.S. to significantly affect our outlook in the areas of interest expense, G&A and underlying effective tax rate.", "Our new capital spending outlook for 2008 is approximately $245 million, excluding the U.S. in the second half of this year. As usual, this guidance excludes self-funded capital spending by our consolidated joint ventures, primarily The Beer Stores in Ontario. ", "Our annual CapEx outlook for the Canada and U.K. businesses, which is incorporated into this guidance, has not changed since our last earnings call.", "At mid-year, we were on plan to achieve our 2008 free cash goal of $550 million, excluding any effects from Miller Coors. As we have shared previously, Miller Coors will have one-time cash outlays of approximately $450 million during the next couple of years to capture the $500 million of targeted cost synergies for this new company. This incremental cash will be divided about equally between one-time restructuring costs to reduce overhead expenses and net capital expenditures to reconfigure the Miller Coors supply chain. ", "Leo Kiely's team is in the process of finalizing these integration and capital investment programs and we plan to share more details next quarter. ", "Now, highlights of our cost-reduction initiatives: in the second quarter, we captured an incremental $18 million of cost savings as part of our three-year, $250 million resources for growth, or RFG, cost reduction initiative. We are on target to achieve our 2008 goal of $77 million of additional cost savings and we have already delivered more than 60% of this annual goal in the first half of the year.", "Looking beyond 2008, we are assessing how the formation of Miller Coors affects our RFG program. As with cash flow, we plan to provide more specifics on our next earnings call. ", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the balance of 2008. Peter.", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Thanks, Stewart. In 2008, we remain focused on building strong brands and reducing costs in each of our businesses. To keep our brand momentum going this year, in Canada, we continue to focus on building our strategic brands. In the second half of the year, we anticipate continued aggressive competitive pricing activity, primarily in Quebec and Ontario. In the face of this activity, we are committed to remaining competitive while growing our strategic brands over the long term, including the introduction of new innovative packaging, promotions and advertising creative.", "Building on our Coors Light Cold Activated Can launch last year, we recently introduced Coors Light Cold Certified bottles across Canada, strengthening our Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment with our consumers.", "We will continue to focus on capturing growth from our super-premium owned and partner-import brands, including the addition of Corona in Western Canada, which has strengthened our national portfolio. ", "In the U.K., we anticipate a challenging trading environment in the second half of the year, due to the weakening U.K. economy. Nonetheless, we expect our U.K. business to benefit in the second half from cycling the U.K. smoking bans, and we will begin to accrue the benefits of the Heineken contract brewing arrangement, the Magners cider agreement, and recent supplier renegotiations. We will also cycle a one-time $9.5 million increase in pension expense in the third quarter last year.", "In addition, we continue to roll out our new cold dispense technology for Carling, with 20,000 new installations year to date, as well as the \"Cold You Can See\" thermo-chromatic packaging and our compact draught system. Coors Light volume is also showing encouraging growth, driven by solid retail partnerships and increasing consumer demand for lighter, more-refreshing beers. ", "Based on the strength of our brands, and considering the challenging cost environment in each of our businesses, we are re-evaluating our pricing plans for the balance of this year. As always, we will make market-by-market pricing decisions that are consistent with our goals of building our brands and shareholder value.", "Following are the most recent volume results for each of our businesses early in the third quarter.", "In Canada, our comparable sales to retail in July, including 50% of Modelo brands for all of Canada in both years, increased at a low-double-digit rate.", "In the first five weeks of the third quarter, our U.K. sales to retail have decreased at a mid-single-digit rate from a year ago.", "In the U.S., with respect to the first few weeks of the third quarter for Miller Coors, we really like our execution over the Fourth of July weekend and our plans heading into Labor Day. Because it is very early days in the financial reporting of this shared venture between two parent companies, we are not in a position to discuss volume more specifically for this particular straddle quarter but we do look forward to having Leo Kiely and Tom Long on our next earnings call to discuss the performance of the U.S. business. ", "Regarding cost reductions, we are on track to meet or exceed our goals in 2008. Looking at the cost outlook by business, in Canada we now anticipate that our reported cost of goods per barrel in local currency will be virtually unchanged for full year 2008. We expect comparable cost of goods sold per barrel to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in local currency. This is up from the guidance of low-single-digits on our last earnings call. ", "Comparable 2008 cost of goods in Canada excludes the new Modelo Molson joint venture accounting, the loss of the Foster's contract, and an $8 million full-year benefit of cycling 2007 foreign currency adjustments. ", "This guidance implies improved Canada cost trends in the back half of this year, in particular in the fourth quarter, despite a challenging commodity cost environment. This outlook is primarily due to cycling higher materials costs and additional expenses related to closing our Edmonton brewery and starting up the Moncton brewery last year.", "Our U.K. team will continue to attack costs and maximize the return on our production assets. We are targeting substantial savings as part of our resources for growth program, driven by headcount reductions, supplier negotiations and improvements in supply chain efficiencies. We are also reviewing opportunities to further reduce overhead costs. We currently expect full year 2008 U.K. cost of goods per barrel to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in local currency. ", "Since the new Miller Coors business in the U.S. will be critical to our future financial performance and shareholder value, I want to provide an update on the progress to date. ", "Leo Kiely and his team have filled virtually all the top positions in this new company. I believe that they are truly taking the best talent from both the Coors and Miller organizations and building one of the strongest teams globally.", "Miller Coors has hit the ground running on integration and marketplace effectiveness, including their commitment to deliver $500 million of cost synergies. As an example, they are already making adjustments to their supply chain to improve service and lower costs. The extensive planning over the past 10 months is paying off, and as we move to peak season, these efforts will gain even more momentum.", "From a financial reporting standpoint, Miller Coors results will flow through our P&L in a new equity income line above operating income. This will be pretax income, and corporate income taxes on these results will be paid at the parent level.", "For greater visibility, we also plan to provide a full Miller Coors income statement each quarter in U.S. GAAP, along with selected balance sheet and cash flow information. These results will be released by the parent companies, Molson Coors and SABMiller, on the same day as the Molson Coors earnings release, starting with our third quarter release on Wednesday, November 5th.", "We will have Miller Coors results to discuss in future quarters and Leo and others of his top team plan to participate in our earnings calls to provide perspective on the U.S. business. We will provide more details on Miller Coors\u2019 strategies and plans on our next earnings call, along with the first quarter of results from this exciting new company. ", "To summarize our results and discussion today, in the second quarter we created the most significant business combination in the history of U.S. beer; a new company that will make us stronger and more competitive in the U.S. Miller Coors offers tremendous potential in resources and value for Molson Coors and our shareholders. ", "On a company-wide basis, our top brands continue to outperform the industry and we achieved net pricing gains and substantial cost savings in each of our core markets. At the same time, however, energy costs and commodity inflation have become bigger challenges. This cost inflation, combined with our higher tax rate, drove lower underlying earnings for our total company in the second quarter. ", "In the face of these challenging economic conditions, we continue to implement value-adding strategies that will allow us to build our brands, achieve positive pricing, reduce costs, and grow profits and cash for our shareholders. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and we are more excited than ever about the future for Molson Coors Brewing Company, as we strive to become a top-performing global brewer.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment: our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, our Investor Relations team, led by Dave Dunnewald, will host a follow-up conference call, essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast and recorded replay on our website.", "So at this point, Matt, we would like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Peter, a couple of questions on Canada -- just a clarification, did you say it was up, volumes were up mid-single -- or I guess STR is up mid-single-digit in the month of July? And if so, can you tell us what\u2019s happening local currency on net revenue per barrel?", "And then, also on Canada, Molson Canadian, down mid-single-digits in the quarter. Can you give us an idea of how that played out by region, or at least by Quebec and Ontario on that brand?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "I\u2019ll let Kevin jump in in a minute, as he can give you probably more detail on some of the questions but what I actually said on Canada for July is that the STRs were up low double-digit, and that basically represents a bounce-back in July from really what was unprecedented bad weather in the Canadian market in the quarter that we just experienced. ", "We won\u2019t give guidance on where we are in terms of margins but Kevin, do you want to pick up on the Canadian question, the Molson Canadian question?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Mark, the Molson Canadian is not sold actually in Quebec. It\u2019s sold in the rest of Canada and if you look at it, it had a good period in the Atlantic and broadly speaking, the rest of the country was pretty consistent, about mid-single-digit decline in the quarter.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "And Kevin, on that low double-digit increase in July for all of your brands, do you put all of that on weather on or are there also -- is it getting more promotional?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Well, to be honest, the weather wasn\u2019t super in July either. I think that we had a couple of good weekends early in the month. We\u2019ve got a couple of extra shipping days in Quebec but basically I think the country has decided, this is a little bit anecdotal, but the country has decided that it\u2019s time to have summer, that there was enough rain in June, and we can see shipments from an industry perspective are quite strong in July and broadly speaking, it had to happen -- there\u2019s no indications that the industry is in decline or anything like that. It was just some pretty bad weather for a prolonged period of time in May and June, which as I said has extended into July but a little bit of it would be promotional but most of it I think is simply returning to normal levels where the industry has historically grown year over year at about 1%. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "And when you say up low double-digits, are we talking the same number of selling days in each period or are you getting the benefit of the selling days in that number?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Well, in Quebec, for example, you would get -- there\u2019s a couple of extra shipping days and that\u2019s -- in Quebec, our STRs are measured by shipping days, so there\u2019s a little extra days in there but most of it would seem to be, or at least half plus would seem to be the industry strength and us participating or more than participating in that. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.", "Analyst for Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "This is actually Zack standing in for Kaumil. I have a quick question for you guys -- could you just comment on whether there were any cost-savings opportunities in the U.S. that you guys ended up delaying in the quarter, you know, waiting for the closing of the Miller Coors JV?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "I\u2019ll take that -- the short answer is no. We ran the business as we would. We got the cost savings that we wanted out and the Miller Coors people are working very hard at the moment putting together their plans to make sure that they get their cost savings and synergies out as well, so what you would expect, really. ", "Analyst for Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Banc of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Good morning. Peter, I guess one of the things that we\u2019re sort of struggling with on this side today is visibility, and seeing that the cost inflation expectations have changed sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter and now looking out into next year, and I think there\u2019s about a 35%, 40% difference in the range of consensus estimates for next year between the high and the low end, can you talk a little bit about, as much as you can on some broader themes? First, where you stand today relative to past statements that management has made on share buy-backs. Also, is the language on your expectations for the phasing of the cost savings from the Miller Coors JV the same? Meaning is it still $50 million in year one, the first fiscal year after the JV closed? ", "And then also, if you could talk a little bit about your expectations for the continuing of cost savings programs in -- resources for growth, I guess, savings in the U.K. and in Canada beyond this year. ", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Okay, Bryan, I\u2019ll try my best to answer all of those for you and I\u2019ll let Stewart jump in as well to help out as well. ", "First of all, can I just -- before I address the specifics, can I just say we appreciate that this particular quarter is slightly unique. Miller Coors as a business is less than five weeks old and so we simply are not in a position to provide you with the sort of information that we would like to provide you with and which we will provide you with on an ongoing basis. So our apologies for that but it\u2019s just -- and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand why that is the case. ", "In terms of your specifics, on share buy-backs, we really want the same visibility that you want on Miller Coors and what is likely to be our expenditure and their cash needs going forward. We\u2019ll have that by the end of the next quarter and that will give us -- that will put us in a position where we can discuss that particular issue with our board clearly, so that\u2019s where we are on that one. ", "In terms of the synergy savings then, yes, everything is still in line with the numbers that we\u2019ve given you previously, $50 million in the first year and so on. And again, Leo and his team will be able to update you on that at our next quarter announcements. ", "And in terms of the cost savings, our resources for growth program is bang in line Canada, bang in line in the U.K. I think we said in the announcement that we are bang in line with hitting the numbers that we\u2019ve already given you for this year and again, the Miller Coors people are working on their numbers and we\u2019ll have greater visibility on that at the end of the third quarter. But at the moment, certainly we are very confident that we are in line with our cost saving-program. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "The only thing I would add to that, Bryan, is that if you looked out for ROT this year, I mean, we\u2019ve delivered 60% of the numbers already. We feel confident about this year. We are taking a look at next year in concert with Miller Coors and on that subject, we feel quite confident that to the extent that there are any detrimental effects from the Miller Coors joint venture, that that will be offset by additional savings they had realized on their side. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from Credit Suisse.", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Good morning. Could you expand on the importance of the Corona brand in Canada? You mentioned it briefly, and for your growth, with Modello on the block, if Modello goes to InBev, how do you hang on to the brand? And if you lose it, how does it affect your Canada earnings?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "I\u2019ll let Kevin again jump in on the detail of it but you are well aware we\u2019re not going to speculate on anything that might happen in the future. We\u2019ve got no more insight into that than you have, to be honest with you, but Kevin, do you want to talk about the Modello brand specifically in Canada?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "The Modello brand, it\u2019s hard to give comparisons because we\u2019ve added Modello to Western Canada this year, so it obviously distorts the numbers. But it is a sizable brand that continues to enjoy good growth, both in the east and western part of Canada, and we\u2019ve had a long relationship with Corona and the creation of the joint venture for us and for them we think is a great opportunity to continue to grow in the country. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "How important is it to your portfolio and to your growth? It\u2019s a pretty important brand in the portfolio, no?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Yeah, it\u2019s within our -- it\u2019s one of our top 10 brands. It\u2019s not our biggest but it\u2019s certainly not our smallest. As I said, it\u2019s -- I\u2019m trying to give you a size without giving the actual share here but it is -- I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s one of our more meaningful brands. It\u2019s after obviously Coors Light and Molson Canadian but it\u2019s a very substantial brand and it plays a very important role in our super premium portfolio. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. ", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Carlos, just to clarify because maybe we didn\u2019t make it clear -- our agreement with Modello for the Corona brand in Canada is a long-term agreement, so there\u2019s not question of us losing it, if that\u2019s really what you are trying to get at. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s the concern.  ", "Peter Swinburn", "", "No, if that answers your concern, hopefully we\u2019ve done so. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. Kevin, a couple more questions on Canada, particularly focusing on the pricing environment there -- if I look at revenue per barrel in the second quarter, it looks like it was more moderate growth than the first quarter, while the fuel and commodity outlook has worsened. So I\u2019m hoping to get a little bit more color in terms of the competitive promotional activity, as well as your promotional activity. And with commodity outlook getting worse, your confidence level in taking more pricing to offset the commodity inflation there. ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "In the second quarter, we still got pretty good pricing in the marketplace. Our pricing grew, our MSR grew about 3% per barrel, which is pretty good growth. The first quarter was a little bit better because we had taken pricing a little bit earlier in the year than in previous years, so our comparables versus previous year were a little bit better. But if you look at it on an ongoing basis, obviously we are facing a challenging cost environment. There\u2019s still a province or two where we have yet to take pricing this year and obviously we\u2019ll be looking very seriously at those quite soon. But I think given all the cost pressures, we will be going back even to markets where we\u2019ve already taken some price this year and look at those markets and say should we be re-looking at our price for this year and ongoing to try to offset some of these cost increases. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "And what are you seeing from your competitors and their pricing?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Well, I think they are right in there with us in terms of -- it\u2019s a pretty aggressive marketplace right now. One of the things with the kind of weak industry in May and June, it\u2019s caused people to chase volume a little bit and worry about what the summer was going to be like. So I think what you are seeing out there now in a couple of markets is some pretty aggressive discounting, probably more aggressive than a year ago right now, as people are chasing a little bit of volume. ", "This market has historically gone in some of those cycles and we would expect that things will work their way through. Everybody is facing the same challenge and cost environment but right now, it is pretty aggressive out there. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then I think your MG&A in Canada was down 6% if you exclude some of the factors that affected the comparability. Is that more of a timing issue or cost savings help the MG&A line, or is your brand spending actually declined in the second quarter?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Well, our marketing and sales, if you like, rather than MG&A on a comparable basis year over year is about flat. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then a couple of questions in the U.K. market -- you talked about the second half potentially getting better as you cycle the smoking bans a year ago. Are you seeing any evidence that that is indeed happening? Sales to retailers were down mid-single-digits in July, so it doesn\u2019t really look like it got a whole lot better.", "And then secondly on pricing, it seems like you got a little bit more promotional in off-premise outlets and I\u2019m wondering if this is something that we should look forward to going forward, and are you pleased with the returns that you are getting as you ramped up promotional spending in that part of the channel?", "Mark Hunter", "With regard to the industry, I mean, what we\u2019ve seen is basically the industry volumes have accelerated from a decline perspective through the second quarter, so second quarter was down about 4.6%, the first quarter was down a couple of percent, so the total market at the half year is down just over 3, and we would expect the market for the full year to be down around about 3.5% in total volume terms. That still has a little bit of uncertainty associated with it because although we\u2019ll be cycling the smoking ban from last year, clearly the U.K. economy is not in great shape so consumer spending and disposable income is clearly under a lot of pressure. But we\u2019re currently forecasting total market volume to be down pretty much in line with where the market is at the half year, around about 3.5%. ", "With regard to pricing, we I think intimated at the start of this year that we wanted to be more selective in some of our promotional activity in the take-home market. We lost share as a business last year and as we\u2019ve come through the first two quarters of this year, we\u2019ve managed to achieve both pricing growth and market share growth, which is really the formula that we\u2019re looking to repeat on an ongoing basis. ", "Our pricing growth was a little bit lower in the second quarter, principally because the take-home market, the off-premise market took up a larger proportion of the overall volume in margins and the take-home market are generally lower than they are in the on-premise market. ", "But we will continue to push for selective promotional activity through the balance of this year. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then my last question, a clarification on the cash flow outlook from this year. That didn\u2019t change even though the tax rate guidance went up -- is that correct?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "That\u2019s correct, Judy. That tax change won\u2019t affect us from a cash flow perspective. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Farkas from Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. A couple of questions, if I could -- with respect to your Canadian market where your costs of goods or the raw material inflation was up eight points, and this was offset by 2.5 points of your cost savings, this ratio seems a little bit lower, of course, than what you reported in the past with your cost savings program offsetting a lot of the inflation. Can you talk a little bit about firstly, is that ratio correct going forward, given the inflation pressures that we are seeing?", "And then with respect to North American raw material, specifically on your packaging inflation and your AG inputs, we can all see what fuel is doing, what is your hedging position and outlook on those two particular components? Thank you. ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "I\u2019ll take those. Let\u2019s start with the inflation has been higher than in previous quarters, obviously. Peter mentioned or Stewart may have mentioned that for the rest of the year, we see more mid-single-digit increases. A lot of what you saw in this quarter has been driven by a combination of agriculture but obviously fuel is an important part of our business, as we have DSD delivery system in some provinces and we share a system through either BBL or TBS with some other brewers, so we\u2019ve seen some pretty dramatic increases through there, and some of that going forward will depend on what\u2019s happening. You know that right now, oil is moderating somewhat, which is good news for us, but we are forecasting that it\u2019s not going to get a whole lot better. It\u2019s certainly for the balance of the year, the agricultural products we\u2019ve kind of built in today\u2019s pricing, as well as oil. ", "So if there\u2019s any upside in that, it would be in the sense of if there\u2019s some substantive movements downward in oil.  ", " ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Do you hedge where you can on these inputs?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Just to cover that point, we don\u2019t as a rule sort of get into all of our specifics of hedges, but all of our hedging is taken into account in looking at our going forward COGS for the rest of the year, which we\u2019ve outlined at a sort of mid-single-digit rate. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then just a follow-up question on the U.K., with respect to the higher pricing, you\u2019ve talked about a buy-ahead ahead of the higher excise taxes. In the U.K., your pricing was up on core brands 0.6%. Can you talk about whether or not you can pass on more pricing there to offset potentially some of the volume decline?", "Mark Hunter", "We\u2019re currently reviewing pricing options for the balance of this year. It\u2019s going to be a combination of our SKU mix and driving more profitable packs and we are currently reviewing whether there is any room for a more blanket price increase, but that\u2019s still work in progress. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from  Patricia O\u2019Donnell from [Kingdom]. Ms. O\u2019Donnell, your line is open. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Banc of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to get a little perspective on the U.K. There\u2019s been a pretty -- I guess an accelerated level of pub closures in the last year or so. I think I read one story where there\u2019s maybe 1400 pubs closed last year and they are closing at a rate of two or three per day right now. ", "So two questions related to that -- one, are your volumes and sales being influenced or affected by sort of a reduction of inventory in the trade? If you\u2019ve got fewer customers, there\u2019s not only just less throughput but maybe less stock in the trade, so maybe like a de-stocking effect. ", "And then the second thing is does it still make sense to spend the capital on cold dispense equipment right now if the on trade is declining at the rate it is? And I think Carlsberg said this morning that 2Q on trade was down something in the neighborhood of 9% in the second quarter. So could you just talk a little bit about that and how that\u2019s affecting your numbers and maybe affect your thinking going forward?", "Mark Hunter", "With regard to the pub closures, I mean, clearly that\u2019s a concern for the long-term viability of the pub industry in the U.K. I think what we are seeing at this stage is that the pubs that are closing tend to be the smaller volume pubs, so pubs you would describe as kind of the tail end of the market, so their impact on our overall performance relative to the industry is pretty small at this stage. So I would rule that out as kind of a material issue in the short-term but clearly as we look longer term at pub closures generally and on-premise performance is a concern for us. ", "With regard to CapEx, we will continue to invest in those outlets that we think can generate a material return for us, so we are very selective with regard to where we are installing cold dispense. It\u2019s all being driven on the back of our core brands and brands that we see having a long-term future, so it\u2019s important that those brands represent themselves effectively. But this isn\u2019t a ubiquitous approach across all customers. It\u2019s a selective approach and we look to invest where we can maximize the returns. It tends to be with those customers who are investing in the retail proposition and where our brand positioning is reflected at the point of purchase. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. And if I could just follow-up on the -- again in the U.K. on the pricing, were the excise tax increases passed through by retailers or did they not pass that, the excise tax increases through to consumers?", "Mark Hunter", "It would certainly appear that within the off-trade market, the excise increases were not passed through so we\u2019ve seen very little movement in off-trade pricing. And the on-premise, most of the excise tax increases seemed to have been passed through. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "And does that potentially raise the question or a flag that there could be some more aggressive regulatory action taken? I mean, part of the -- my impression has been part of the reason why excise taxes were increased were to raise revenue but part of it is a public policy action to try to curb consumption, and it seems both in beer and wine that the off-trade has sort of ignored the suggestion that shelf price ought to move up. ", "First of all, am I on target with that and if so, is there a chance that maybe there\u2019s going to be potentially more aggressive regulation to try to ensure that you don\u2019t get the same level of discounting in the off-trade?", "Mark Hunter", "It\u2019s a good observation, Bryan. You have to connect that to two things; the first thing you need to connect is the commentary from the current U.K. government and other interested bodies about their concern relating to aggressive promotional pricing in take-home and the need for something to change. And then you have to connect that to the fact that there\u2019s going to be an election in the U.K. probably in the next 18 months, so the likelihood of the current government putting through a material change that affects retail pricing, I would suggest -- and this is a pure personal perspective -- would be pretty limited. ", "There is a lot of discussion around this topic and we will wait to see whether there will be any movement from the government, but I would just set it in the context of a forthcoming general election. ", "Bryan D. Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) I am showing no further questions. ", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Okay. Thanks very much, Matt. We\u2019ll call that a wrap. Thank you, everybody, for joining us and thanks very much for your interest in Molson Coors. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program.

(Operator Instructions)  I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Dave Dunnewald, Vice President of Investor Relations at Molson Coors Brewing Company.  ", "Dave Dunnewald ", "On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2008 follow up earnings conference call.  Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings related questions as possible following our regular earnings conference call with Peter Swinburn and Stewart Glendinning earlier in the day.  We will use a standard question and answer format and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour, so let\u2019s get started.  With me on the call are Leah Ramsey, Manager of Global Investor Relations, Mark Ingebritson, Senior Director of Global Accounting and Financial Reporting, Scott King, Director of Strategic Finance, Greg Snider, Group Manager of Global Forecasting and Analysis, Mario Sisneros, Senior Analyst Global Forecasting, Phil [McFarland], Director of Tax, [Kara Row], Group Manger of Tax and Bill Waters, Vice President and Global Controller.", "Now, as usual I\u2019ll preface our remarks by summarizing our Safe Harbor language.  Some of what we discuss this afternoon may constitute forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially from what we project today so please refer to our most recent 10K, 10Q and proxy filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect our projections.  We do not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  Regarding any non-US GAAP measures that we may discuss during this call, please visit our website www.MolsonCoors.com for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest US GAAP results.  ", "As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, in the second quarter we created one of the most significant business combinations in the history of US beer.  A new company that will make us stronger and more competitive in the US.  Miller Coors offers tremendous potential in resources and value for Molson Coors and our shareholders.  On a companywide basis, our top brands continue to outperform the industry and we achieved net pricing gains and substantial cost savings in each of our core markets.  At the same time however, energy costs and commodity inflation have become bigger challenges for our company.  This cost inflation combined with our higher tax rate drove lower underlying earnings for our total company in the second quarter.  In the face of these challenging economic conditions, we continue to implement value added strategies that will allow us to build our brands, achieve positive pricing, reduce costs and grow profits and cash for our shareholders.  ", "By way of follow up to our earnings call this morning, I\u2019d like to offer some additional perspective regarding the quarter and our performance going forward.  When we think about how our business is doing overall, we have a number of reasons to believe that we are headed in the right direction and have the right strategies to drive performance going forward.  There are a couple of things that I wanted to highlight for you.  First of all, looking at cost of goods trends in Canada and the United Kingdom, we expect these trends to improve in the second half of the year versus what we saw in the second quarter.  For example, if you look at what we talked about on this morning\u2019s call, Canada had a mark-to-market adjustment, a one-timer last year of $5.8 million in cost of goods.  In the UK, we had $3.5 million approximately of additional pension expense in the second quarter so there is $9 or $10 million that is not going forward.", "At the same time, as we move in to the third quarter in the United Kingdom you\u2019ll see a $9.5 million cost for pension in the prior year period, third quarter of 07.  If you add these factors together you get a swing factor if you will from second to third quarter of $19 to $20.  Now, this is obviously just related to comparables and doesn\u2019t take in to account other factors but we do actually have other factors to focus on, for example strategic improvements that we have coming.  You all know about Miller Coors and how important that will be to our company going forward.  You also know now about the United Kingdom where we have the Heineken deal, Magners supplier renegotiations, some of those types of things that we talked about on the call this morning.  ", "We also have a challenging inflationary environment but we also have sustainable solid pricing levels in the US and Canada which also bode well for driving our business forward and dealing with some of the challenging inflation that we face.  More broadly, we talked earlier in the year about the UK business and how that was the most challenging call it performance in the second quarter and earlier in the year, on the first quarter call we talked about how we expected our UK performance this year to be essentially a tale of two halves where the first half would be very challenging related to smoking bans, some additional costs, tougher comparisons, things like that.  That\u2019s in the half of the year where we generally make less than a third of our annual earnings.  So, essentially we\u2019ve seen that play out this year in 2008 and now with all of the strategic improvements and changes in comparables that we\u2019re looking at in the UK we\u2019re expecting the other half of that tale of two halves going forward.", "Those are some of the reasons why we feel good about the strategies that we have as a company and where we are headed in the quarters and years ahead.  With that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from the line of Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Just to get back to Canada and I appreciate your comment about what factors we should look for in the second half, I just want to understand that I\u2019m looking at the right line item when you talk about virtually flat cost of goods per barrel year-over-year.  You reported up 19% in the first quarter and up 10% in the second quarter, is this the right number I\u2019m looking at?  So, this whole year would suggest to be flat suggesting declines in the second half?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Almost.  When you saw 19% that was an all in number including FX.  If you strip out FX, which we did for the flat number, that was in local currency, if you strip that out I think you get to \u2013 let me verify that, if you strip out FX I get \u2013 ", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "You have about eight points it looks like from currency.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Actually 1.4% actually.  ", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "So the other factors as you discussed about quarter-to-quarter comparisons would improve that number in the second half?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, the factors we talked about on the earlier call, sure.", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "The second question, with respect to your MG&A, your guidance was still about the same $115 million plus or minus but the first half was substantially, implied, larger than the second half.  Why would this moderate so much in the second half, your corporate MG&A?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, that\u2019s right.  If you recall Greg reminded me that we had that long term incentive plan that paid out in the first quarter, that was a three to five year plan that paid out so obviously a lot of extra additional expense in the first quarter including in the corporate segment.  That is not an ongoing situation and you did not see that in the second quarter.  Although, you did see a little bit of additional call it incentive payments in the US business for a very strong first half performance and that level of performance, well we\u2019ll see whether \u2013 the business would have to very much outperform for that to be an ongoing level of expenses and you saw that primarily in the MG&A line.  ", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Then you have guidance about the 2009 tax rate being below the 22% to 26%.  Is that just due to timing of when you\u2019re going to close some of those issues this year?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "That\u2019s right.  Essentially, you remember our guidance on the last quarter\u2019s call, we showed the 08 effective rate at a lower level than our long term rate.  About 10% or 15% I think was the last guidance we gave.  The rate for 08 that we just gave on this call this quarter is somewhat higher because of the timing of closing out those tax years.  It essentially was just a shift from 08 in to 09 so it\u2019s a timing difference and not a change in either our long term rate, or I guess you do see a shift in rate between 08 and 09 but that\u2019s the only change.  ", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Last question, then with respect to Miller Coors coming in, how you report this going forward will the US business then be pulled out of your top line and we\u2019ll get an equity income line coming in about the pre-tax line or above the operating income line?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, you\u2019re honing in on it there.  Right, we will no longer show US call it Coors Brewing Company or Coors US throughout our P&L.  Instead we will have an equity income line in our consolidated P&L and that will flow in right above the operating income line.  So, it will be pre-tax income taxed at the parent level.  Then in addition, we plan to provide a full P&L for the Miller Coors joint venture in US GAAP with obviously explanations around that.  Then, we will provide a reconciliation to get you from call it the bottom line on that full Miller Coors P&L  over to the equity income line on our consolidated P&L, does that make sense?", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Any chance we will get pro formas on the prior quarter either prior to that date or on that date?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Our plan is to give you pro formas as we go, yes.", "Christine Farkas \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "So we\u2019ll get the prior third quarter but no more?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "That\u2019s the plan now.

Would we expect it to be kind of in the $80 million range next year?  Because, I would imagine that we would have some of the corporate costs taking out from the US operations so if we look at where we were at the beginning of the year versus kind of the second half run rate, would we be kind of in the $80 to $90 million range?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "No.  The impact on the corporate area, call it corporate expenses from the formation of Millers Coors is really relatively modest, in other words, there\u2019s some give or take. There are some things that will move in to our P&L and there are some things that will move in to theirs.  None of them are huge anyway so I probably wouldn\u2019t model it the way you\u2019re suggesting.  I think I\u2019d take a look at recent quarters and use that more as your basis.  Not the first quarter, as I talked to earlier with Christine because the first quarter had that long term incentive expense in it.", "Orin Baranowsky \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "We had about a little more than $70 million in the first half and then you\u2019re guiding to $110 to $115 the second half so which is closer to what the run rate is $40 to $45 million or $70 to $75 million?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "One thing you want to keep in mind is that we do have global markets now in the corporate segment as well which will tend to bump it up a little bit and that I guess will partially offset the long term incentives going away.  But, we do anticipate about $110 million of corporate general administrative expense plus a little bit of global market expense.  We will give you the break out of the corporate piece separate from the global markets piece going forward but let\u2019s focus on corporate here a minute because the global markets is quite small.  Corporate is around $110, I don\u2019t see a reason why \u2013 for example, global markets would be only in the range of 10% to 15% of the corporate amount.  But in any case, looking at the $110, I don\u2019t see a reason why you should model  that dramatically differently next year.  If we have some cost savings that we\u2019re planning or something like that then we\u2019ll update our guidance at the appropriate time later in the second half of this year.", "Orin Baranowsky \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Would we see a more seasonal smoothing of that $110 compared to what we\u2019re seeing in 2008 then?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair assumption.", "Orin Baranowsky \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Then 10% to 15% on top of that for the global markets?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Right.", "Orin Baranowsky \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Secondly, you said cap ex about $240 million for this year, correct?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, $245 was our outlook for this year and that would exclude second half capital spending by the US business which is obviously now part of Miller Coors.", "Orin Baranowsky \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Then what would we expect for next year?  Kind of in the $180 range?

Now, this entity is a direct pass through on a cash basis with the two parent companies so to the extent they need operating cash they\u2019ll get it from their parents and to the extent they generate it they\u2019ll pass it through to their parents in relatively frequent manner.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "A couple of questions here, with your free cash flow view for the year unchanged $550 million, I\u2019m with you on why a GAAP change in taxes as no bearing on free cash flow but you\u2019re saying the cost environment is getting more challenging which is of course real costs.  So, in your mind, what are the incremental positives whether they are top line or cost related that are causing your free cash flow view to be unchanged?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "There are obviously a lot of things that go in to our cash view.  Well, we did say by the way, our resources for growth program is on plan, right so that\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s real cash as well and that\u2019s even with the formation of Millers Coors.  That would be for 08, right.  In addition, I did mention a little bit earlier about the solid sustainable level of pricing that we\u2019re seeing in \u2013 well, the US doesn\u2019t give us benefit in the back half directly in the free cash plan but Canada does so I would say just overall business performance, we have some monetization of non-strategic assets we\u2019re thinking about.  We did for example a monetization of a distributorship in the first quarter.  We also did a small one in the second quarter.  And we also have a focus on working capital trying to maximize that or improve that.  We also have some other assets for example in Edmonton Brewery we closed that we no longer need and some other assets that I won\u2019t go into today.  But a little here, a little there, it all adds up.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Do you know off hand where you were on monetization of non-strategic assets and where you are today, how much delta is there?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I would say we\u2019re doing fine on that at this point.  Those types of events are sometimes hard to predict the exact timing of but so far so good.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "As relates to the UK, there are several things that were mentioned earlier and by you at the beginning of this call.  Can you give us an idea of how significant these benefits are in terms of dollar impact or rank order them or a little more detail on them?  I mean, a phrase like \u201csupplier renegotiation\u201d is a pretty attractive phrase but we really don\u2019t know how significant it is.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a good strategy and it\u2019s great that we\u2019re doing it, supplier renegotiations.  The UK team always as long as I can remember has put a great deal of energy around improving their business and that\u2019s one example.  Nonetheless I would put it at the bottom of the list of the things that we talked about.  More important than that would be the Heineken contract pack deal.  We said that would get 2 million or 3 million hectoliters by the time it\u2019s ramped up in 2010 and that means we essentially have to do that ramping between mid-year this year and through 09.  So call it a slow ramp up of a contract brewing arrangement.  But that\u2019s a lot of volume and so we do anticipate getting at least some benefit from that in the back half.  And if you work your graph paper from a standing start mid-year 08 and get to that level by the end of 2009 actually, then you might be able to get an assumption on how much we could benefit from that.  Looking at it in global benchmarks, it\u2019s a relatively attractive production contract for us and we think it\u2019s attractive for Heineken as well.  And then the Magners deal, cider is an attractive business; it\u2019s the fastest growing segment in the UK market; Magners is the largest selling cider in the UK; however, it\u2019s always been packaged up till this time.  So again it\u2019s a ramping up from essentially zero in the second quarter of this year, actually I think late in the second quarter is probably the best way to put it and the rollout is going well.  But we are starting from zero so it\u2019ll take us a while to see the full benefits, but I think it is useful to know that Magners and ciders generally are growing fast at a double-digit rate and they have relatively nice margins.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "And when we first heard about the contract brewing Scotch and New Castle that there wasn\u2019t a change in control as we\u2019ve since seen.  Did that whole process with Heineken, did that have any bearing on what you originally referred and we just heard you refer to today as favorable economics?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "No.  There was no impact that I\u2019m aware of from the S&N call it purchase.  No impact on our situation with the contract brewing arrangement in the UK.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "As far as tax rates for 09, I might have missed it, but when you\u2019re saying the tax rate comes back down, did you give us some range?  In the past you\u2019ve talked about a rate in the teens but can you give us an idea of where your head is?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Essentially our guidance went from 10% to 15% for 08 and then talking about long-term guidance from there to, we raised that guidance to 20% to 24% instead.  And that difference essentially shifts into 09.  That\u2019s all we\u2019re saying is that these audits happen on a rolling basis and we anticipate closing some of these in 09 instead of 08.  So it\u2019s purely a timing difference.  And based on the difference in our guidance for 08 on this call versus the last call, you can just shift that into 09 if you want.", "Mark Swartzberg \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "So think about it as a 10% to 15% number for 09?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Just take the percentage change in our guidance which, let\u2019s see, we went from it was if I recall correctly 10% to 15%, that\u2019s now 20% to 24% so that\u2019s about 10 percentage points.  And then look at our long-term rate and you can back that off and that\u2019ll give you a sense I think.  We haven\u2019t provided any guidance for 09 but that seems like the best methodology based on the publicly-available information.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Scott Paulson - Cornerstone.", "Scott Paulson - Cornerstone", "I understand that fuel and oil prices went up a lot during the quarter, but you kind of had a pretty good inflection from being in front of it in the first quarter to behind it in the second quarter.  Could you kind of walk through at least what the drivers there were and your ability to price or not price at a higher rate?  And secondly, if I heard you right, you said that the pension impact to the UK in the second quarter was $3.5 million and in Q3 of 07 it was a $9.4 million impact.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Good questions.  I\u2019ll take the last one first.  The pension call it higher expense in the second quarter of 08 versus 07 was about $3.5 million and we also even more important we had an extra expense because of a change in some benefits and that sort of thing plus some catch-up expense in the third quarter of 07 and that was I thought it was $9.5 million in that timeframe.  We talked about it on our call in the third quarter of 07.  $9.5 million incremental pension expense in that quarter.  So that gives you an idea of the flow of pension expense in the UK being very important when you\u2019re looking at second quarter results this year and then what do we look for looking ahead to the third quarter, what do the comparisons look like.  So I think that covers pension in the UK.", "If you look at fuel costs, just looking at the world price of oil and the relative inability to hedge based on the types of call it transportation services that we buy, it\u2019s difficult to do much hedging in that area.  So I would say that if you look at the world oil price you can see some of the challenges that really all of our businesses have faced from fuel and other energy costs increasing in this year.  Relative to the beginning of the year, it\u2019s noticeably more.  Now that\u2019s a smaller base than packaging materials but packaging materials are a commodity that does allow some hedging.  We don\u2019t say how much; neither do our competitors; but let\u2019s just say that on a percentage basis we\u2019ve seen a much bigger swing in fuel than we have in call it packaging materials on a year-to-date basis.  Now the fuel and energy is really across all of our businesses.  ", "If you move to commodities, that is more of an issue in the second quarter in Canada and the UK.  If you look at what\u2019s happened to agricultural commodities on a global basis, they\u2019ve increased in the range of 50% or more year-to-date.  And in the US as you may know it\u2019s pretty common knowledge that we contract grow directly with farmers in the western states.  That tends to give us a large amount of smoothing effect.  We are not able to do that in Canada and the UK, so agricultural commodities are closer to market prices at least in their changes so I think you saw a significant dose of that in the second quarter.", "As far as pricing, what can we do?  Well I think we\u2019ve shown again relatively healthy pricing in Canada.  3% pricing in the first and second quarters looking at an overall inflation rate, that looks relatively sustainable.  If you look at the pricing the Canada business was able to achieve going back a year or two, which it was noticeably less than that, actually 3% looks pretty attractive.  And we have been able to price there.  The UK we\u2019re a little bit more limited because of some of the industry dynamics going on there and some of the opportunities frankly that we\u2019ve seen in the off-trade to get our brands to consumers in a little bit more proactive way than perhaps we would have a year or two ago.  Does that help?", "Scott Paulson - Cornerstone", "Yes.  You had cost reductions of $18 million in the quarter.  Where did that all flow?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "The cost reductions actually were across all three of our businesses.  For example, if you look at the various businesses, we have tended to get the most cost savings historically out of that program in the US.  And in fact the US did get call it more than a third but not as much as we\u2019ve seen in some prior years as the resources for growth program has moved through the years, matured, whatever, moved through the process, the US business is no longer more than half the savings.  In fact Canada had nearly as much in savings as the US did and then the UK was a bit lower than that.  So in a nutshell we really got savings from all three businesses and not skewing toward the US as much as they have historically.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "", "First I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear on the free cash flow expectation and tell me if this isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.  But you set an expectation for $550 million when the year started and that assumed that the JV didn\u2019t occur.  So that number is fueled or is supported in part by the assumption that you\u2019d own Coors Brewing Company for all of 2008.  And then what\u2019s changed is whatever impact you\u2019ve had on your earning stream, you mentioned the net impact of monetization and now you\u2019ve got the JV has actually happened.  I guess the question is if there are up front cash uses by the JV like severance costs, you\u2019ve indicated some up front cap ex, it\u2019s possible that $550 million you could be something less than $550 million if some of that incremental or initial cash investment is pulled into the back half of 08.  Is that the right way to think about it?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I think it is Bryan.  I\u2019d call it the background or the thought process around that is with the Miller Coors business five weeks old or whatever and they are making great headway in finalizing plans and selecting the top team, they\u2019ve selected all the top folks and they\u2019re doing layer by layer getting throughout the business.  But as part of that or you could say because we\u2019re relatively early in the process there, we don\u2019t have perfect visibility at this point to the timing of the cash needs.  I think we know full well what the overall cash needs will be and we\u2019ve talked about it to capture those synergies.  What we don\u2019t have visibility to is the exact timing of those cash needs in the near term.  Until those plans are finalized and call it more the staffing selections made, we don\u2019t know precisely how many dollars the Miller Coors business will need in the back half of 08.  Now we do expect to have much better visibility on our next earnings call around that.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "But half of the $400 million of cash that\u2019s going to be needed is related to headcount reductions, is that correct?  Or severance I should say.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, about $230 million of it.  We\u2019ve got $450 million we talked about, call them one-time cash needs, and about $230 million is one-time costs, things like restructuring, severance, that sort of thing, and the other $220 million or so is incremental cap ex to reconfigure our supply chain in the Miller Coors business.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "If it were to be that especially with that portion of it, the severance portion of it, assuming that those are some of the early things that will get done, then there\u2019s a chance that that could be sort of a use of cash in the near term that could potentially impact the initial starting point of $550 million of free cash flow.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, that\u2019s right.  The only caveat I\u2019d put around that is you\u2019d want to weigh that against whatever appropriate assumptions you have around cash generation for the total Miller Coors business.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Second question, on the tax rate and maybe defer to your panel, in understanding the timing is what\u2019s moving the accruals around but the decision I guess earlier this year to begin accruing towards much lower tax rates and making a switch in that accrual now, what\u2019s the process towards some of the factors that went into making the accrual in the first place and I guess what I\u2019m driving at is trying to get a handle on if we\u2019re going to go ahead and model a 16% tax rate or somewhere in that neighborhood for next year, what type of reasonability should we put behind that number or probability should we put behind it?  Because it seems like it\u2019s a number that\u2019s certainly bounced around a bit and how much of it is just that the accrual was made a little aggressively?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "That\u2019s a fair question.  Maybe a little background will help you.  When we look at our tax rate, it\u2019s driven by a lot of different things.  One of the more significant things recently is FIN 48, which I\u2019m not going to go into what that is because that\u2019s technical stuff that we don\u2019t need for this call I don\u2019t think, but essentially the new rules for accounting have resulted in greater volatility in our tax rate.  And you\u2019ve seen that ever since it was enacted in early 07.  And by the way, to answer your last question up front, I don\u2019t think our assumptions for tax rate are ever aggressive and this year I would say fits the mold there as well.  Essentially what you\u2019re trying to do under FIN 48 and basically our tax positions generally is trying to figure out when will tax years close.  And you have all these different taxing authorities around the world and you have to make some estimates about when those taxing authorities will say, \u201cOkay, I guess we\u2019re done with this year.\u201d   And after they\u2019ve worked through their analysis and discussed it and all that.  And you have to make an estimate on that and we made an estimate that we thought we could get through certain tax years this year earlier on and that looked very promising right up until call it late in the second quarter.  This was something that I think we had a very good basis for being confident about.  And based on discussion with those taxing authorities, now we think 09 is more likely.  We don\u2019t expect a different outcome, but we expect different timing.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "And the settlement of past tax bills?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Essentially companies like ours are audited by virtually every taxing authority in every geography every year and then over time either the statute of limitations or whatever rules they have in place essentially have them go through those taxes and decide whether or not they\u2019re okay with them or if they\u2019re not, obviously we discuss it and then you resolve whatever differences you have and you move on.  And when it happens that means you\u2019ve closed the tax year.  And as I say, that happens in multiple geographies.  Every year we have new tax years rolling into this process and tax years rolling out.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "One last question Dave on the diluted share count.  Diluted share count picked up a little bit.  Is that the convertible?  Is that the impact of the convertible or was there something else?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Actually I guess my favorite way to handle that question is to build it from the bottom up and that\u2019s to start with the basic shares because when they increase that also increases the diluted shares on a share-per-share basis.  What I mean by that is basic shares increased about 3.5 million shares year-over-year essentially because of stock options  exercises mainly last year as our stock price went up and then there was a little bit, say 0.5 million shares in that basic count for that long-term incentive that vested in the first quarter.  So that gets you to 3.5 million basic shares and then all of those of course would increase diluted shares and then if you want to get from that to the incremental I think it was 1. something million shares increase in addition to that in the diluted count, I think it was 1.2 million or 1.7 million or something like that, you would layer on a few additional shares for that long-term incentive plan but mainly just simply the way the diluted shares calculation is done, 0.5 million shares drove that.  So we\u2019ve got 1.3 million shares diluted on top of the basic shares and of that 1.3 million, nearly half was just a higher stock price.  Only 200,000 shares was convertibles.  That was your question.  And then the rest would be a few additional shares the performance shares that vested in the first quarter.  Those have a basic component and a diluted component, so you get a couple hundred thousand there.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "So looking at the share count going forward, will it continue to creep up sequentially?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Subject to discussions with our Board that we talked about around stock buy-backs, we would expect, in other words [inaudible] get a stock buy-back program approved, then you\u2019re likely to see some additional stock option exercises.  Now at 3 million shares related to stock options on a year-over-year basis is a relatively high number for us so that might be less likely.  And by the way we have not provided stock options to our employees for, none this year and as I recall, Scott did we give any last year?  I know we had [inaudible] and other stuff, but I mean pure stock options?  Yes, none this year and none last year.  So the overhang has reduced in the last two years.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Harry Garcia - Palisades Investments.", "Harry Garcia - Palisades Investments", "You said on the call that you were re-evaluating the planned price changes for the remainder of the year.  Is it safe to assume that you mean lower price increases?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "No.  I\u2019m glad you asked the question.  When we think about re-evaluating our pricing plans for the year it\u2019s really within the context of a challenging cost environment.  What that means is we will be looking for additional opportunities to increase prices on a very selective market-by-market basis where it makes sense.  So it\u2019s the opposite of what you suggested.", "Harry Garcia - Palisades Investments", "Is there anything else that you could be doing but you\u2019re not to combat high commodity prices?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I think given the aggressive cost savings programs we\u2019ve done, given the latitude and pricing opportunities which are based on the strength of our brands and all the other levers that we can pull in our business or work, I would say the team has been very energetic about going after things.  But it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re done either so I think there are a lot of additional cost savings opportunities that we will be able to look at.  And certainly Miller Coors is a huge example of how we can cut costs going forward and make our business stronger and also obviously build shareholder value.  That $500 million of synergies is huge and that\u2019s one of the reasons along with some top line benefits that we anticipate capturing, that\u2019s one of the reasons that this is arguably the biggest business combination in US beer ever.", "Harry Garcia - Palisades Investments", "You said that you weren\u2019t done, but other than Miller Coors is there anything specific or that you\u2019re thinking about that you could give as an example?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I was speaking specifically about cost reductions.  As our teams, operations teams and other teams throughout the company work together we\u2019re always looking for ways to cut costs.  And we showed that when we did the Miller Coors merger, excuse me the Molson Coors merger three and a half years ago.  In that one we came in with a synergies target of $170 million over three years.  We delivered $180 million.  And at the same time in the second year of that merger we also were able to do enough analyses, what I call deep-dive analyses, throughout the operations footprint and other areas of the company to come up with another $250 million worth of savings.  That\u2019s not something you can do when you\u2019re looking at the business from a very high level, let\u2019s put this merger together or whatever, and that goes by the way for Miller Coors, let\u2019s do this US joint venture between two parent companies.  You have to take a relatively high level view and you can\u2019t do the kinds of analyses to capture all the savings or I guess identify all the savings.  So that means we\u2019re going to keep looking.  Miller Coors will keep looking and so will the other businesses related to Molson Coors for additional cost savings for our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management.", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "I\u2019m just getting a little confused over the pricing.  You\u2019ve talked about taking more and yet it appears that there\u2019s more discounting going on off of the list price in Canada and some of it\u2019s by package, some promotions are package promotions.  Can you give me a better handle on that?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Looking specifically at Canada pricing, if you look at the actual revenue per barrel benefit from pricing it was about 3% in the second quarter and about 3% in the first quarter.  And there were a few timing differences that Kevin Boyce mentioned that gave us the first quarter numbers slightly higher than the second quarter number but not a major difference.  The main point is 3% pricing we see relative to the overall inflation rate is relatively sustainable rate.  It\u2019s a good pricing rate and it seems as though it\u2019s one that\u2019s about right for our business.  Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t risks to that and we are seeing some additional discounting activity in various markets but I must say that on the whole potential discounting or even actual discounting flare-ups are relatively common in Canada as they are in the US.  So we\u2019re watching those very carefully.  We\u2019ll see how they pan out.  But at least in the second quarter the discounting was not a major issue and so we\u2019re watching the hot spots going into the third quarter.", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "Can you talk about the sequential changes in the Molson volume in Canada?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "We said the Molson Canadian in Canada down mid single digit rate.  Is that what you mean?", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "Yes.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "And you\u2019re wondering about July?", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "Sure.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Actually I don\u2019t have July specifically for those brands.  We don\u2019t normally provide that level of detail but based on the overall performance of the business being up at a low double digit rate, I think you could assume that it\u2019s noticeably better.", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "When you\u2019re looking at your competitor up there, or the mix, let\u2019s just address the mix.  Do you find that in the industry that it\u2019s leaning toward the lower-priced type of beers?  How\u2019s that mix looking for you?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "That\u2019s a good question.  Let me finish the thought on the previous one.  When I say the Molson Canadian brand should have been noticeably better in July, I meant relative to what we saw in the second quarter.  It was down mid single digits in the second quarter, you\u2019d expect it to be quite a bit better in the July timeframe just based on what was going on in the industry and in our overall business.", "Shifting to the mix question, actually thankfully in great contrast to what we saw in 2005 when we did the Molson Coors merger, our mix in Canada, let me shift to the industry mix because the story\u2019s essentially the same, the value brands are roughly flat and have been for a number of quarters now.  And that\u2019s good news.  There\u2019s much more segment stability in the Canadian market than we saw even a year and a half to two years ago and much more stability than we saw three, three and a half, four years ago.", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "And then pricing in the US, well actually pricing in volume, can you give us an idea first of all on the volume in the US as we go into this quarter and then how the pricing mix looks for the industry here?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "If you look at volume, really all I can give you is what we said on the earlier call which is we had a very strong 4th of July and our programming was very effective.  We really liked what we saw.  We also feel very good about the lead up to Labor Day.  Because we just put this business together and we\u2019re essentially working the financial reporting piece with two parent companies and so forth, we\u2019re not going to provide specific volume numbers.  But the industry numbers point toward a very strong 4th of July this year for the major players.  And certainly the Coors brands went into the joint venture with momentum that would indicate that they would benefit from that at least as much as any other brewer.", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "Some of the data we\u2019ve seen showed something like 9% growth in convenience stores.  Is that the kind of very strong we\u2019re looking at?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Well if the Coors business in the second quarter pre-Miller Coors was, if you take out the effect of July 4 timing, you really were around 7% growth.  It\u2019s not hard to imagine 9% growth or perhaps even more based on the kinds of trend changes we\u2019ve seen leading up to July 4 just based on the call it industry sources, what some of our competitors have said about their volume around the 4th of July timeframe.  So I guess the answer is yes.  Does that help for that?  And then I can talk about price.", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "Yes.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "On pricing, the pricing environment in the US industry for really the past two and a half to three years has been really consistently good in getting slightly better over time as commodity costs have increased, now not exactly in lock step.  Let\u2019s just say the pricing environment that we saw in the first and second quarters this year of 3% is solid pricing.  Depending on which CPI measure you pick for the US, it\u2019s still less than that so it feels sustainable.  But it\u2019s covering more than, that with cost savings are covering all the inflation that we saw in the US business and that\u2019s quite an accomplishment.", "Marian Montagne - Thrivent Asset Management", "Are you seeing much of the 30 packs out there?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, 30 packs are one of the largest packs that we have in the US.  It\u2019s a relatively stable package.  We\u2019re seeing some growth of course but the good news is, and that package by the way skews heavily towards grocery stores and mass merchandise channels, the good news is in our US business in the second quarter and actually in the second quarter and going back a few before that, we\u2019re seeing solid growth across all the channels.  So regardless of what 30 packs are doing, which is not very much, we\u2019re seeing great growth across as I say all channels in 47 out of 50 states, really attractive broad-based growth.  And the pricing environment has been sustainable and attractive for some time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Analyst Inaudible.", "Analyst Inaudible", "I apologize I got into the call a little bit late.  But I wasn\u2019t sure about you mentioned something about a mark-to-market in one of the reporting areas there.  Could you help me out with that?  What was that?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, we have some currency hedges in our business, specifically on a Canadian dollar, and prior to the second quarter of last year is when we essentially achieved hedge accounting on those and no longer had to mark them to market.  But up until that point, and actually I guess I mean including the second quarter of last year, after that we won\u2019t have to mark these things to market.  But prior to that when we saw a movement in the Canadian dollar, we\u2019d have to adjust those hedges to market and that would result in an expense or an income on our income statement.", "Analyst Inaudible", "And that was an expense to you guys, is that right?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, Paul.  A year ago it was an expense to us and we even said the $5.8 million last year in the -", "Mark Ingebritson", "Derivatives are always market but they\u2019re on the balance sheet of their value.  It\u2019s just a question of whether or not our way of hedge accounting and the realized gains are deferred.  And that\u2019s where we are.  It\u2019s just that in the second quarter last year there was a change in our hedging and there was a $5.8 million unfavorable foreign currency adjustment recognized that was somewhat unique.", "Analyst Inaudible", "And there\u2019s no mark-to-market in the quarter just past Q2?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Nothing of that magnitude or of that type.  We still have derivatives outstanding; we hedge those items; but we do have hedge accounting; we have hedge effectiveness; and so the gains and losses on derivatives simply flow through as the underlying items flow through the income statement and it flows through much more naturally.", "Analyst Inaudible", "So is that change between last year and this year, is that part of your underlying earnings that you talk about in the press release or how is that dealt with?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "No Paul, in this particular case we didn\u2019t think that this expense qualified as a one-time item for treatment to essentially put back in for our underlying earnings.  So it\u2019s not adjusted for that.  It\u2019s in the numbers so to speak.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Just some clarification on the timing of the synergies from Miller Coors JV.  The $50 million the first year, and that\u2019s starting as of now?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Good point.  And actually the best way to answer that is in two parts.  One, we have a commitment and two, we have the reality of where we are with Miller Coors.  Number one, the commitment that we laid out last October is that we will capture $500 million obviously and then $50 million of that will be in the first financial year.  That\u2019s the commitment.  However, at the time we rolled it out we didn\u2019t know when Miller Coors might be completed.  It could have been in December; it could have been in May; who knows.  We got it done mid-year so now the reality is it\u2019s done and the teams are not sitting around waiting for the first financial year to start.  They\u2019ve already started going after savings.  So rather than adjusting either the commitment or the timing at this point, since we\u2019re only five weeks in anyway, what I would do is look at it as an opportunity for the Miller Coors team to exceed their goals.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "So when you first laid out the commitment, in your view the first financial year was really starting the first year of the calendar year financially?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, for Molson Coors that\u2019d be correct.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "But now you\u2019re saying the reality is that they\u2019re already starting to implement some of the projects that could potentially lead to savings coming in faster than what you had laid out in the commitment?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "That\u2019s an opportunity for us, yes.  I think the key is just not to assume that because the commitment is starting in 09 for $50 million that the Miller Coors team is sitting around waiting for that.  They\u2019re definitely not.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Just so I understand, under the commitment the $50 million is starting in 2009 and then the $225 million or the next round of savings accrue in calendar 10 under the commitment?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Yes, at this point that\u2019s what the commitment is.  Year one is 2009, year two is 2010 that\u2019s $350 million additional, and then year three is 2011 with another $100 million of additional cost savings to get to the $500 million.  That\u2019s the commitment.  I just want to make sure that people know that the Miller Coors team has an opportunity to exceed that commitment based on completing the deal in mid-year 08.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Has Miller Coors started to change any of the brand strategies in terms of the positioning of the brands, etc. at this point?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I would say that there are no significant changes that I\u2019m aware of.  There may be some minor things with smaller brands that have been adjusted, but at this point there haven\u2019t been.  And I think it\u2019s important to know that with Miller Coors putting these two companies together really was not an opportunity to rationalize brands and that sort of thing.  It was actually to do more with the brands we have.  And they have distinct positioning and they\u2019re very competitive in the market place and we want to actually increase that competitiveness rather than focus on rationalizing brands.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "The continued delay in the decision on the use of cash, whether increase your buy-back or increase in dividends, etc., is that purely tied to just really trying to get a better handle on the cash outlays as relates to Miller Coors JV?  Because it seems like every quarter we get this response \u201cA few months out we\u2019ll have better clarity or better visibility,\u201d and we keep waiting and waiting and we just don\u2019t get a clear answer.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "We apologize for testing your patience on that.  No, you\u2019re right.  To answer your question, the short answer is yes it is specifically related to the relative lack of visibility that we have right now to the timing of the cash needs for Miller Coors.  Because that\u2019s a big nut as they say, $450 million over the next couple of years, and how that timing lays out will be very important.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC.", "Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC", "A couple of quick questions on Canada, first is just the low double digit growth in July.  Can you just clarify is that a selling day adjusted?  Is that a real STR number or is that somehow not adjusted for a difference in shipping days or something like that?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "That is not adjusted for shipping days.  As Kevin Boyce mentioned on the earlier call, the Canada market is so different province-to-province.  There are some differences we believe in shipping days year-over-year in certain provinces that would tend to reduce that number a bit but it would still be a really strong number anyway.  ", "Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC", "Any sense of what the industry is doing?  Would you expect that you\u2019re gaining share in that environment?  Or, is it just strength in the industry overall?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I think based on the strength of the number we ought to be at least even or gaining share.", "Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC", "Then just on the commodities inflation that you\u2019re expecting in Canada, it looks like there is a moderation embedded in the guidance for the back half of 08.  Kevin talked a little bit about just the timing of when the agricultural run up started late last year.  Is that primarily the reason or is there anything else going on?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "Well, we also mentioned we had some additional costs to close down our Edmonton brewery and also to start up our [Monkton] brewery and those aren\u2019t huge factors but if you roll it all together it\u2019s meaningful.  It does get you from essentially the trend we saw in the second quarter to the annual guidance of mid single digits on a comparable basis or flat on an all in basis in local currency.", "Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC", "So that basically tells you the all in number has to be down in the back half, right?  My math isn\u2019t wrong on that?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "It needs to be lower than what we saw in the second quarter.  I\u2019m not sure you could model in a down number.", "Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC", "Well, if I\u2019m up call it 1.5 to 2 in the first half and I\u2019m suppose to be flat for the year, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m down in the second half?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "It might be.  I\u2019ll let you do the math.  We gave you the numbers.", "Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC", "Then in the UK, you\u2019re starting to lap the smoking bans in the second half and I know the economy is not in great shape but is the expectation for kind of no improvement in the industry environment just because the economy is weak or is there anything else?  Or, is that just sort of conservatism on your part you think?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I would say there\u2019s conservatism but, it\u2019s warranted.  What I mean by that is we know the smoking ban will get better.  We do not and we still do not the effect of smoking bans to be zero.  Once you lap it you still see some lingering softness in volume but less, right.  Then, within a couple of years, normally a year and a half two years, normally you see relatively little effect.  Because we now have an economic issue and the UK in my experience in the beer space, the UK is one market where we have seen some macroeconomic issues that actually effect volume and the industry more than I\u2019ve seen any other mature beer market and as a result I think there are some question marks around how significant would that be.", "Lucas Klein \u2013 Riversource Investments, LLC", "", "Then the pricing environment for the back half of the year, I mean underlying price this quarter on owned brands is up about .5%.  Is that kind of reasonable to think about going forward or again you consider maybe a little bit more given commodities pressure?", "Dave Dunnewald ", "We didn\u2019t provide any forward guidance on UK pricing so I guess I\u2019ll leave it to you to model that.  What I would say is that the competitive dynamics if we move from \u2013 you know, take out the strategic things that we\u2019re doing related to cost, the Heineken co-packing arrangement, Magners and all that, set aside all that and just talk about the competitive set in the UK.  Essentially when you role from the first half to the second half you\u2019re going from smoking bans to some macroeconomic questions.  How does that affect pricing?  It\u2019s hard to say at this point but you\u2019re essentially giving up one and picking up another. But, beyond that, I\u2019ll let you model it.", "Operator", "", "I\u2019m showing no further questions.", "Dave Dunnewald ", "I did want to mention just one additional piece.  When I was talking earlier about Canada mark-to-markets, I did want to emphasize that that was a benefit this year in the second quarter and not a benefit to the prior year so that\u2019s not something that will help us going forward from second to third quarter.  Beyond that, I just wanted to thank everybody for your interest in Molson Coors and for joining us today.

At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode.  Later we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will follow at that time.  If anyone should require assistance during the conference, please press star, then zero on your touch-tone telephone.", "Before we get started I want to paraphrase the company\u2019s safe harbor language.  Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today.  Please refer to its most recent 10k, 10q and proxy filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.

Sir, you may begin.", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks very much.  Welcome to everybody and thanks very much for joining us today.  With me on the call are Stewart Lindening, the Molson Coors\u2019 CFO, Leo Kiley, CEO of Miller Coors, Gavin Hattersley, CFO of Miller Coors, Kevin Boyce, CEO of Molson Canada, Mark Hunter, CEO of Coors Brewers Limited, Sam Walker, Molson Coors\u2019 Chief Legal Officer, Bill Waters, Molson Coors\u2019 Comptroller, and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors\u2019 Vice President of Investor Relations.", "On the call today Stewart and I will take you through some highlights of our third quarter 2008 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspective on the balance of the year.  As part of this review we will share our first financial results for Miller Coors.  Then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Before we discuss our specific financial performance, I want to share a few highlights related to our third quarter performance.  First, with the current state of the global economy and financial markets Molson Coors is in an enviable position.  We have a brand-led company with a solid track record of building great beer brands in all of our major markets.  We are a solid cash-generating business with no significant debt maturing before 2010.  Our balance sheet is strong after paying down substantial debt during the past several years.  We have a track record of delivering cost savings on or ahead of our commitments.  We are more than half way through our $250 million resource [unclear] growth initiative, and Miller Coors is off to a great start on its $500 million synergies program.", "Second, the Miller Coors integration is progressing well with the first-quarter of combined financial results coming in ahead of expectations and more than 28% growth in underlying earnings versus the pro forma results a year ago.", "Miller Coors announced today that it is accelerating its three-year synergy savings targets by six months versus the original commitment when the venture was announced more than a year ago.", "The third point I\u2019d like to make is that our Canada business is performing well.  Competitive price discounting in Quebec, along with continued steep commodity inflation, however, held back our Canada profit performance in the quarter.  As always, we remain focused on long-term brand building, but in the short term we have had to take actions to protect our share.", "Fourth, the UK businesses grew market share and net sales [unclear] on the strength of our brands despite facing a daunting array of industry challenges.  This team also successfully implemented an interim price increase at the end of September.", "Finally, during the third quarter we accumulated an approximate 5% economic exposure to Foster\u2019s via a cash-settled totally tuned swap undertaken with Deutsche Bank as our swap counter-party.  We recorded this swap in our financial statements for the third quarter, including a market-to-market gain of $13.6 million in our corporate other income.", "This is an interesting market that we\u2019ve been studying for some time, and we view this as an attractive opportunity.  Foster\u2019s operates in a profitable market.  The exposure was available to us at an attractive price, and it represents a prudent and appropriate level of exposure with low carrying costs and plenty of flexibility.", "At this point I\u2019ll turn it over to Stewart to review the third quarter financial results and trends, and then we\u2019ll cover the outlook for the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Peter, and hello everyone.  I\u2019ll start with the third quarter financial highlights.  Our underlying pre-tax income increased 4.4% driven by the strength of our brands and cost reductions.  On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $175.8 million, or 95 cents per diluted share, was 1.5% higher than the third quarter a year ago.", "We will discuss our earnings performance today primarily in terms of underlying income, a common performance measure that excludes special and other one-time items from our US GAAP results.  Also unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in US dollars.", "It\u2019s important to note that our third quarter underlying earnings excludes some one-time gains and expenses, particularly related to the formation of Miller Coors and the Foster\u2019s swap position, as well as $24.8 million of net special charges.  These adjustments to our US GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning.", "Foreign exchange movements decreased our total company pre-tax profit by approximately $3 million in the third quarter on an underlying basis driven by a 7% year-over-year depreciation of the British pound versus the US dollar.", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pre-tax income of $151 million in the third quarter was 8.1% lower than a year ago.  This profit decline was driven by three factors:  first, increased cost inflation and price discounting this year, second, cycling the final House of Blues Canada equity allocation and Foster\u2019s US contract earnings last year, and third, lower income from the Modello brands resulting from the new joint venture this year.", "To provide more comparable results as I discuss the Canada results, I\u2019ll provide year-over-year changes that exclude the reporting effects of discontinuing our Foster\u2019s US contract last year and of setting up the Modello Molson joint venture, and the impact of the Miller Coors joint venture this year.", "Let\u2019s review the highlights.  Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the third calendar quarter ended September 30th increased 3.7% on a comparable basis versus a year ago, driven by strong industry performance and high single-digit growth of Molson\u2019s strategic brands which represent more than 85% of our Canada STRs.  Strategic brand growth was fueled by double-digit growth of Coors Light, and Carling, in comparable partner import brand growth at a high single-digit rate.  Molson Canadian experienced a mid-single-digit volume decrease compared to the prior year.", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail grew an estimated 3.1% in the calendar third quarter.  On a comparable basis our third quarter Canada estimated market share increased approximately \u00bc of a share point versus a year ago.  Our Canada sales volume was 2.1 million barrels in the third quarter, an increase of 2.6% on a comparable basis versus the prior year.", "Comparable net sales per barrel increased slightly in local currency, as a result of favorable sales mix of our products, including sales increases of our higher revenue per barrel partner import brands.", "Pricing per barrel declined approximately 1% in the third quarter, as we faced significant pricing pressure in Quebec and, to a lesser degree, in Ontario.  Cost of goods sold per barrel in the third quarter increased nearly 7% on a comparable basis in local currency.", "This underlying cost-of-goods increase was due to the net effect of three factors: one,   higher commodity packaging material and other input costs drove a 5% increase combined with a 2% increase due to higher fuel costs in incremental freight to supply Western markets while we upgrade our Vancouver brewery.  Second, these inflationary increases were partially offset by 2.5% of savings from our Resources for Growth cost initiative, and Third, finally, an increase of slightly more than 2% due to the ongoing shift in sales mix, including increased sales by a higher cost partner import brands.", "Comparable marketing general and administrative expenses in the quarter have decreased approximately 1% in local currency, driven by lower amortization and administrative expenses.  Other income decreased 2.6 million in the third quarter, driven by cycling the prior year, final income, from the House of Blues, Canada business, which was sold in 2007.  In the US, underlying US segment pre-taxing income increased 13.7% to 92.1 million in the third quarter, driven by strong underlying growth by Miliquiz vs. a year ago.  Note that this US segment result includes our share of the Miliquiz net-income and various adjustments for the equity income calculation.", "Looking specifically at the Miliquiz PNL in US GAAP, underlying that income for the quarter, increased 28.2% to 190.8 million from the prior year performa results.  This earning\u2019s growth was mainly due to strong pricing and reductions in marketing and overhead expenses, which more than offset the impact of commodity inflammation and lower shipment volume.  During a quarter, Miliquiz rose by .7% after adjusting for the extra trading day in the period, plus 2.3% on an unadjusted basis.  Due to continued growth from 7 of its 12 largest friends, including, Quizlife, Bluemoon, KeySunlight, Milihighlight and Quizbanquet.  Miliquiz\u2019s shipments to wholesales declined by .5% due to reductions and distributed inventory levels in the third quarter.  FDR\u2019s for the company\u2019s flag-ship premium light brands, were up 1.4% vs. the prior year.  Quizlife\u2019s  STO\u2019s increased vs. the prior year.", "Quizlife\u2019s STO\u2019s increased an impressive 6.8% due to gains in both distribution and velocity while Mililight\u2019s STO\u2019s decreased 3.6%.  Miliquiz\u2019s total net sales increased by 2.1 to 1.95 billion vs. the prior period.  Excluding contract growing, net sales were up to 2.3% to 1.82 billion.  Pricing remains strong as total company net sales per barrel increased 3%.  Miliquiz\u2019s revenue growth outlook for the balance of the year is expected to remain strong as the company implemented selective price increases on the majority of its beer volume in September and October this year. Net sales was virtually unchanged due to strong growth by the company\u2019s premium life craft and import brands, largely upset by cycling significant Milichill launch ramp-up volumes in the prior year.  Costs for barrel increased by 5.6% as reductions related to legacy Coors and Milisavings initiatives called resources for growth in the project unicorn, were more than upset by increase commodity and fuel costs.", "Marketing general and administrative expense decreased 9.1% reflecting favorability, due to the non-recurrence of prior-year Millichill launch costs, which were partially upset by MGD-64 launch costs this year, as well as a reduction in share-based compensation expenses.  Finally, depreciation and amortization expense for MilliCoors in the third quarter was approximately 70 million. In addition to properties and intangible assets totaled 67 million.", "Moving to our UK business, third quarter underlined pretax income of 30.7 million with 4.9 million on 19% higher than a year ago.  This increase is driven by the benefit of supply of contract negotiations this year, and a 4.8 million reduction in pension expense as we cycle the one time 9.5 million increase in pension expense last year.  Third quarter operating results also benefited from the company\u2019s 7th consecutive quarter of year over year pricing growth, the introduction of draft magnum cider continuing cost reductions and profits from our new contract brewing arrangement.  Challenges in the quarter includes, lower sales volume and high commodity and energy costs.   Finally, a 7% decline in the value of the British pound vs. the US dollar reduced underlying pretaxing combined approximately $3 million.", "We gained market share in the quarter, as our UK own brand volume decreased 3.1% year on year vs. a total industry decline of more than 7% due to poor summer weather, continuing effects from smoking bounds and a weakening economy in the UK.  Calling the largest UK beer brand, declined a low single-digit rate and gained share in the third quarter.  Comparable net sales per barrel of our own products increased 2.5% in local currency, about 2/3 due to higher pricing in both the on-premise and off-premise channels and 1/3 driven by positive brand mixing, including growth and drop draught magnum.  Comparable costs of good salt per barrel of our own products increased 7.7% in local currency in the third quarter, due primarily to higher energy and materials costs-inflation.  Compatible costs exclude costs exclude, a $6 million benefit from changes to supplier contracts related to the first half of 2008, as well as the benefit of cycling one-time pension expense in 2007.  Marketing general and administrative expense in the UK, decreased 5.1% in local currency, general and administrative expense decreased due to a combination of actions to drive down the cost base and cycling the one-time pension expense due to a combination of actions to drive down the cost base, and cycling the one-time pension expense last year.", "Marketing expense in the quarter decreased as management took action to reduce spending line with the trading environment.

Corporate net interest expense declined to 2.7 million from a year ago, because of the benefit of debt-restruction completed last year, along with lower debt balances this year.  The underlying loss for global markets incorporate was 49.7 million pretaxed in the third quarter, and 11.9% decrease as a result of lower corporate GNA and interest expense this year.", "Moving beyond the operating business unit performance our third quarter effective tax rate was 25% on a reported basis and 21% on an underlying basis.  Free cash flow year today through the third quarter reflected a net cash generation of 255 million which was made up of positive operating cash of 396 million plus 36 million of proceeds from asset sales minus capital spending of 177 million.  This free cash flow result represents a $220 million improvement this year due to both lower capital spending and higher operating cash flow vs. the third quarter of 2007.  Total loan debt at the end of the third quarter was 1.9 billion, excluding approximately 95 million of non-owned joined venture debt.  Cash in cash equipments totaled 335 million. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $335 million at the end of the quarter, resulting in earned net debt of $1.57 billion.

We also expect our 2009 effective rate to be below our long-term range of 22-26% by about 6 percentage points because of the anticipated closing or settling of tax years.", "Our capital spending outlook for 2008 is approximately $220 million, excluding the US in the second half of this year. As usual, this guidance excludes cell phone expenditure consolidated by our consolidated joint ventures, primarily the beer stores in Ontario.", "Turning to our free cash flow outlook, we anticipate that incremental cash needs in 2008, related to Miller Coors will total approximately $150 million. These cash uses include retention, deal completion, integration, and restructuring costs along with additional capital spending to capture synergies. In addition, Mulson Coors paid approximately $22 million dollars of one-time cash use for debt extinguishment early in the year.", "Including these factors, we now anticipate that our 2008 free cash flow will be approximately $375 million, plus or minus 5%. If we exclude the one-time cash uses that I describe, we are on-track for our original estimate.", "Including these factors, we now anticipate that our 2008 free cash flow will be approximately $375 million, plus or minus 5%. If we exclude the one-time cash uses that I describe, we are on-track for our original 2008 goal of $550 million of free cash flow for the year.", "Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. In the third quarter we captured an incremental $19 million of costs savings as part of our three-year, $250 million dollar resource for growth or RFG growth reduction initiative. We are on target to achieve our 2008 goal of $77 million of additional costs savings. Looking to 2009, Miller Coors will absorb some of the RFG cost savings initiatives, along with some pre-existing Miller cost-savings initiatives. And I\u2019m pleased to report that our 42% share of these savings, which are on top of the $500 million committed to Miller\u2019s costs synergies, will allow us to deliver on the costs commitments which we have made.", "As Peter highlighted for you earlier, Miller Coors also plans to deliver its costs synergies six months earlier than anticipated, with a three-year delivery period commencing July 1st, 2008.

In 2008, we remain focused on building strong brands, reducing costs to meet our businesses, and generating cash. In Canada, as with our other global markets, we have a consistent track record and advise in and grow our brands. Recent price increases across the Canadian provinces were expected to offset some of the price discounting activity we have been experiencing. Across all of our markets, we will remain competitive, while growing our strategic brands over the long term, and we are well-positioned across all brand segments, with at least one strategic brand achieving double digit growth in each category.", "In the US, Miller Coors began its brewing optimization project to shift volume and brew both Miller and Coors products round its expanded network of eight major breweries.

We do however; expect our UK business to continue to benefit from the Magnus-Cider agreement, recent supplier renegotiations and our contract brewing arrangement.", "Moreover, we are committed to the pricing growth to at least cover the substantial cost of inflation we are seeing. Consequently, we implemented an additional price increase earlier this fall. Our following are the most recent volume results for each of our businesses early in the third quarter.", "In Canada, our comparable sales to retails in October were virtually unchanged versus a year ago. In the first five weeks of the fourth quarter, our UK sales to retail have decreased at a low double digit rate, driven by the retail load in ahead of our late September price increase. Excluding the effect of this inventory load, our FTRs in the first five weeks decreased at a mid-single digit rate from a year ago.", "Regarding cost reductions, we are on track to meet or exceed our goals in 2008. Looking at the cost outlook by business, in Canada, we anticipate that our reported cost of goods per barrel in local currency will increase at a mid-single digit rate on both a reported and a comparable basis for full year 2008.", "Comparable 2008 costs of goods in Canada, excludes the impact of the new Modelar Molson joint venture accounting, the loss of the Foster\u2019s US contract, an $8 million full year benefit of cycling between 2007 foreign currency adjustments and the impact of export sales to Miller Coors.", "Our  UK team is targeting substantial sales savings as part of the resources for growth program driven by head-count reductions, supplier negotiations, and improvements in supply chain efficiencies.

Our preparatory remarks will be on our Web site for your reference in a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 3 p.m. Eastern Time today, our Investor Relation Team, lead by Dave Dunnewald, will host a follow up conference call, essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That will also be available for you to hear by webcast and recorded replay on our Web site. So at this point, Matt, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you\u2019d like to ask a question at this time, please press the one key on your touchtone telephone. If your question has been answered or you wish to remove yourself from the queue, please press the pound key. Our first question comes from Camille Gaduaralla from UBS.", "Camille Gaduaralla - UBS:", "Hi, thank you. Could you give us a little more detail on the Vancouver Brewery, how your progress is, and when you expect it to be 100% up and running. Then, what type of savings can we see coming out of that?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It\u2019s up and running now. We\u2019re running the line in and the line is fully installed, and the savings are primarily going to be in the area - in the short term, at least - of reduced transportation from our Toronto Brewery. So you should begin seeing that very soon.", "Camille Gaduaralla - UBS:", "So you\u2019ve got about a 2% minimal cost in the third quarter, but that\u2019s something that we probably shouldn\u2019t worry about right?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Two percent. You may see a little bit of it in the fourth quarter, and not all of that is directly attributable to Vancouver, because obviously fuel has gone up, but you will see some reduction, yes.", "Camille Gaduaralla - UBS:", "OK, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Kevin, I\u2019m hoping to get a bit more color in terms of your cost profit performance in Canada in the quarter. If you can quantify how much of the decline was really won off the items versus the heightened level of discounting that you\u2019ve mentioned?", "And can you just talk about what\u2019s really driving the higher discounting activity in the third quarter and it sounds like you talked about the fourth quarter trends being a bit of a moderation from a discounting activity perspective. So if you could just go through that in more details I\u2019d appreciate it.", "Kevin Boyce, CEO of Molson Canada", "OK, Judy, let\u2019s start with one-time versus ongoing. The numbers that we\u2019ve quoted are all our ongoing business. We\u2019ve eliminated the one-time. So then if you focus in on the various markets, I\u2019d say in the short term there have been price increases in both Quebec, Ontario and Alberta as well, earlier in September. That will begin - we\u2019re seeing in Ontario not just the price increase of the premium brands, but we have seen over the last six weeks movement up on the products that are the value brands, which is encouraging. And that continues today. So we\u2019re very encouraged by that. I\u2019d say Quebec - although pricing has been taken certainly to date in this quarter - it remains pretty competitive in that market, and if you go back in time this is really - it happens from time to time in our market place where certain markets get overheated and it usually works its way through in a period of time, but this summer was, starting in the second quarter but really into the summer was a particularly aggressive time amongst all competitors in the marketplace.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Just to clarify, Kevin, you sensed that none of the items were one-time, but some of the items that impacted last year were like the House of Blues equity earnings and the Foster\u2019s earnings being included in the last year\u2019s. How much of that really rules the 8% decline in the Canadian profit in the quarter?", "Kevin Boyce, CEO of Molson Canada", "Sorry, I was really referring to the cost inflation and the discounting. There were a couple of items but they were - without giving you the specifics - they were fairly minor in the overall scheme of things. The major items were the price discounting and the inflation.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "OK, and then Peter,", "The 5% equity exposure that you have on Foster\u2019s: how should we think about that from your cash use perspective going forward? I think a lot of people have been waiting for your free cash flow to be returned to share holders in the form of either buy-back or higher dividends, then whether this move signals your intent to be a bit more inquisitive and taking an equity stake in some of the breweries around the world. How should we think about that going forward?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Judy. The two issues aren\u2019t really related. We\u2019ve used a pretty efficient vehicle in terms of actually going to our 5%. We\u2019re not using cash in regards to our prudent sort of exposure, which is pretty limited. We just think the 5% represents a sensible position given our covenant to our banner sheet. In regards to how we use our cash in terms of buying back shares: the reality is, as you well know at the moment, getting cash in the market place is extremely difficult anyway. So we don\u2019t think at the moment it would be prudent to use our cash to actually buy back shares. But the two issues I wouldn\u2019t relate.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "OK, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. A couple of follow ups if I could. Kevin, first on Canada, you talked about early fourth quarter STRs being unchanged, so that\u2019s a deceleration. Do you think that\u2019s on the back of stronger pricing in Ontario and perhaps Quebec, or are you seeing maybe some trade down impact, either away from or towards other categories? What are you seeing there in the early part of the quarter?", "Kevin Boyce - CEO of Molson Canada", "I\u2019d say from an industry perspective, the 3.1 was a pretty heated industry and reflected a couple things. It reflected in Quebec a bit of an inventory build, to be honest, and it also reflected early in the quarter. You may recall last quarter I spoke about the timing of the Canada Day holiday, so adjusting for that I think it\u2019s really the third quarter that\u2019s a little bit inflated  rather than the fourth quarter.  I characterize October as okay, not bad, not great, but in an industry where historically we\u2019ve been at about 1% growth, flat for us is probably a pretty good performance given all the circumstances in the marketplace right now.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Did you give us an indication of how much currency impacted the Canadian results this quarter?", "Kevin Boyce - CEO of Molson Canada", "No, we didn\u2019t, but it was virtually negligible.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great.  Looking at the segment of the US or other, there was about 98,000 barrels sold under US title.  Is that a timing issue?  Is that Puerto Rico?  What is that number, and are we going to see something like that going forward?", "Kevin Boyce - CEO of Molson Canada", "Is that question directed at me, Christine?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "No, Kevin, just in general on your statements or on the Molson Coors statement.  I realize that the US numbers are pulled through the equity income, but there is now a small segment of other - what is that number?", "Kevin Boyce - CEO of Molson Canada", "Well, we had one day of earnings prior to the commencement of the JV.  The JV essentially commenced one day into this quarter, so that $4 million represents the profit for that particular day.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.  You didn\u2019t talk about early fourth quarter STRs for the US business.  Is that something you can cover on this call?", "Leo Kiley - CEO of Miller Coors", "This is Leo.  There\u2019s a lot of noise in our October numbers.  We do have October numbers there that were up marginally on sales to retail, but it really has more to do with pricing and buy-ins ahead of pricing market-to-market.  I think the trend changed and, as you know, one month doesn\u2019t make a quarter.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "No, it doesn\u2019t.  Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks.  Kevin, I have a couple of questions relating to Canada.  I\u2019m trying to put the picture together, looking out beyond the next quarter.  You\u2019re seeing cross margins start to decline.  You\u2019re saying that pricing is picking up but the volume leverage is slowing down a bit, so is there any reason not to think gross margin will continue to be down year-on-year over the next few quarters given the relationship between price and the cost pressures?  That\u2019s a local currency question.  Then I have another question when we bring that back into US dollars.", "Kevin Boyce - CEO of Molson Canada", "There are a number of things you\u2019ve referred to.  First, I think when you reflect on the third quarter it\u2019s been a really strong volume quarter with some cost inflation issues.  As you look at commodity prices there was a lag as commodity prices went up, and there will be a lag as commodity prices are coming down.  There are a number of other factors in there.  We\u2019re very hopeful that this trend will continue and that we\u2019ll benefit from that.  That\u2019s the first comment.", "I think in the very short term the question about volume and things is reflected in the first month of this quarter.  As I said to Christine, there is some loading in Quebec on the price increase that I mentioned.  That will work its way through, so I wouldn\u2019t assume it\u2019s necessarily going to be a flat quarter.  We\u2019re hopeful that it will be what it\u2019s historically been at about 1%.", "Going forward, cogs in local currency will be our challenge in order to get to flat, but there\u2019s some work ahead of us in order to be able to deliver on that.  It\u2019s a challenge we are taking on.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Is that something you think you can achieve?  You say it\u2019s a challenge, but is that something you\u2019re targeting in 2009 or is it going to take longer than that?", "Kevin Boyce - CEO of Molson Canada", "Some of it will depend on what\u2019s going to happen in commodities, to be honest, because in the past, if you just look in this quarter 7% would be very hard to offset.  It depends on how much that moderates.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, There is obviously an issue with the way the Canadian dollar has performed over the last month or so.  I have two questions in that regard.  If we assume, for illustration purposes, that your currency neutral profits are flat next year, operating income flat, what is structurally there?  Let\u2019s say for illustration the Canadian dollar is down 15% year-on-year versus the US dollar next year on average, what is structurally in place to cause that scenario to not produce a 15% US dollar profit decline?  Have you done anything hedgewise that might add to any structural protections you have?", "That\u2019s a translation to US dollar profit question.  I\u2019m going to turn that over to Stewart, if that\u2019s okay with you.", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, let me address this.  As we\u2019ve covered in previous quarters, we really don\u2019t get into the details or the specifics of our hedging.  I can point, however, to the fact that there is an important moderating factor which is the fact that we have a substantial amount of our long-term debt denominated in Canadian dollars.  That presents a natural hedge for us.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s nice, but is there anything on top of that?  Relative to the size of the operating income the interest expense is relatively small.", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "I can\u2019t really give you guys any more details than that.  I\u2019m sorry.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Banc of America.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Good morning.  Peter, I just wanted to get back on Judy\u2019s question relative to the Foster\u2019s swap.  If I understand the logic behind buying the instrument, it\u2019s basically making an assumption that the Foster\u2019s stock price is going to go up, so the question is why would Molson Coors be making that assumption?  What other step is there that might be involved strategically beyond just taking a flier on the Foster\u2019s shares?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There are two points that are really important.  Why have we got this?  I think that\u2019s pretty straightforward as far as we\u2019re concerned.  The Australian market has been interesting to us.  We\u2019ve studied it for quite awhile.  Foster\u2019s is interesting.  We had the opportunity to get into an economic exposure at an entry price that, to us, was very attractive.  We didn\u2019t want to put the business in a position where we had an over-exposure.  We haven\u2019t done that.  What we\u2019ve done, I think, is pretty prudent and sensible within that context.  That\u2019s the background.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "So it\u2019s fair to think that there is a strategic reason to do this.", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I don\u2019t want to misrepresent the Foster\u2019s management, but I think they said that they were in a very fluid situation.  We\u2019ll continue to review our position, and whatever we do we\u2019ll do in the best interest of our shareholders.  I would caution that we could take the view that we could stay where we are, we could move forward, or we might move backward and out.  Whatever we do will be in the best interest of our shareholders.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay.  Just to be clear, right now there\u2019s been no cash outlay for this swap?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I\u2019ll pass it over to Stewart.", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "The economic exposures via the swap don\u2019t require any up-front cash.  Obviously, the gain and loss moves up in direct relation to the stock.  One of the benefits of that, apart from not having a lot of cash out the door, is the fact that we don\u2019t have a big Australian denominated investment that would be subjected to movements in the Australian currency rates.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Stewart, just to follow up on Mark\u2019s question on foreign exchange.  In the seat that we\u2019re in the best we can do without knowing whether you\u2019ve done anything to hedge the translation is to just simply do the arithmetic on currency translation against whatever we\u2019re forecasting for currency-neutral profits in the UK and Canada, offsetting it with the natural hedge you have on the interest.  If you were doing the arithmetic sitting in our seats, is there something else you would do differently?", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "I can\u2019t say that I would direct you to do things differently.  I can tell you that we\u2019re not really in a position to discuss the specific hedging strategy that we\u2019ve undertaken.  You will have to do the calculations as you would normally.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question comes from Carlos Levoy from Credit Suisse", "Carlos Levoy - Credit Suisse", "Good morning, everyone.  I want to very quickly follow up on those questions on Foster\u2019s.  Do you foresee having any role, either in the Board of Directors at Foster\u2019s or any operational link-ups beyond what you already have with the brand?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we don\u2019t see that presently, Carlos.  We have the economic exposure that we\u2019ve announced today, and we\u2019ll just continue to review what happens with Foster\u2019s strategically.", "And we continue to review what happens with the Foster\u2019s strategic review and what their management does.", "Carlos Levoy - Credit Suisse", "Thank you.", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Again, if you have a question please press the one key at this time. Our next question comes from Todd Duvak from Bank of America.", "Todd Duvak - Bank of America", "Yes, good afternoon. Had a question for you on I guess your category exposure. Obviously you\u2019re focused on the beer category. Are you interested in getting into other spirits categories or alcoholic beverages categories, like wine, like Foster\u2019s also has?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That\u2019s not in our strategic game plan, Todd, no.", "Todd Duvak - Bank of America", "And then, just kind of following up on that: stepping back in terms of acquisition policy in general, if you were to make an acquisition of another company, how would you look to finance that and how would your credit rating play into how you would plan to finance it, in terms of: would you look to maintain an investment grade rating? How does that factor into your thinking?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That obviously depends on what sort of business we were talking about. But we\u2019re in a very comfortable position at the moment. We\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet, we\u2019re throwing off cash, and anything that we do anywhere will have to be short term agreed to. It will be prudent and it will be in the best interest of our share holders.", "Todd Duvak - Bank of America", "And I guess just to follow up on that. Your leverage and your balance sheet, as you mentioned, are in a very strong position right now. Could you envision a situation in which you would do something similar to what Conor Riccard did, and forego your investment credit rating for a strategic acquisition?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Again, that\u2019s just pure speculation. I can\u2019t get into that at all, Todd, I\u2019m afraid.", "Todd Duvak - Bank of America", "OK, not a problem.", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "OK, cheers, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Again if you have a question please press the one key at this time. We have a follow up from Christine Farkas.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks so much. I just want to clarify based on your earlier statements about not pursuing a share buy-back at this time. Is that strictly based on the challenges of the current market and accessing capital, or is it because you might think you\u2019d rather keep these dollars earmarked for other strategic initiatives? I mean it was always part of your plan to really study that return in the form of a buy-back, so I\u2019m curious what\u2019s changed.", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Not at all, Christine. As you know, we\u2019re building cash. We don\u2019t have a huge amount of cash yet, but we\u2019re in the process of continuing to build cash. And we\u2019ll have a number of options in terms of how we use that cash. So it continues to be one of the options that on the table. It\u2019s not the only one, but it\u2019s on the table. We haven\u2019t taken it off the table. Does that answer the question?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s a little more clear, thanks a lot.", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "OK, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Mark Swartzberg.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:", "Thanks again. Question about the JV Mechanics. If I\u2019m reading the numbers from the press release correctly, the amount of cash that was funneled back up to you at TAP was about $59 million versus equity income of $106.5 million. Is there anything unusual about this particular period, any reason we shouldn\u2019t be thinking that from quarter to quarter at least typically you\u2019re going to be getting all the cash flow back to you? I guess part of the answer has to do with CapEx that occurs there at the JV. But how are you thinking about the relationship between what you get back and what the JV actually generates?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks for that question, Mark. It\u2019s a complicated question only because obviously the JV is going through a period of trying to drive those synergies. We\u2019re been pretty clear that to achieve the $500 million in synergies they\u2019re going to have to spend about $450 million. That doesn\u2019t come in any sort of erasable way. I can tell you from a shareholder, as a shareholder of the JV, we are in a place where we are looking to get the cash from our joint venture as rapidly as possible. We do have a process that we go through each month, which looks to minimize any cash that\u2019s actually held at the JV.  So to the extent that we don\u2019t get cash it\u2019s because we\u2019re putting the cash to good use in the joint venture itself to drive those synergies.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:", "Is there anything contractual there that obliges them or is it all based on mutual concern?", "Peter Swinburn - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I do think we have a fairly clearly laid out set of contracts that explain what the mechanics will be around the cash transfer.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.:", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Bryan Spillane.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks. Stuart, just a follow-up on pensions. So this balance sheet for the quarter shows that the pension liability down to $400 million versus 677. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s the transfer of the US pension plan to the Miller Coors JV?", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, that\u2019s correct. You\u2019ll see a lot of obviously big movements in the balance sheet that all relate to stripping that out of our balance sheet and putting it essentially in one line as an investment in the JV.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "And then as we\u2019re looking at pension expenses and pension funding going forward: given the return in the markets, can you just give us some thinking of how we should start thinking about funding status for pensions going forward? And also how pension expense may be affected by that?", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Let me give you a couple pieces. I mean, it\u2019s hard to give a very precise answer here, because obviously with the current equity performance levels expense and expense will likely be higher next year. It\u2019s very difficult to say precisely what number that will be, and I just can tell you from previous years this stuff moves around a lot, obviously while equity may be down, discount rate is up, and it\u2019s very difficult for me to give you any guidance around that. And my best advice is to wait until year end. As it relates specifically to cash requirements of the pension plans, those are driven mostly by various regulatory bodies.", "In the case certainly of Canada and UK that\u2019s a bit of a triennial valuation. And depending on where that falls, that may or may not drive increased contributions. And I\u2019d say the last thing, which is a moderating factor for us is that the last couple of years we have been gong through a process of trying to de-risk those pension plans by shifting assets from equity-based instruments into fixed income instruments. So mix all that together and you\u2019ll have to wait really until the end of the year to get a better picture of what that will look like.", "Bryan, the thing I would add is the de-risking that we did was before the recent sharp declines in the equity markets.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "So higher proportionate fixed income before the equity markets went down?", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "That\u2019s right. If you look at our year-end 10K you\u2019ll see that all of our major plans - call them defined benefit plans - were in the range of half-equities, which was a substantial reduction from before we did the de-risking.", "Bryan Spillane - Banc of America Securities", "OK, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Again, if you have a question please press the one key at this time. Gentlemen, I\u2019m showing no further questions.", "Stewart Lindening - Chief Financial Officer", "OK, thanks, Matt. Thank you, everybody for joining us, and thank you for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s call.

", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Thank you, Matthew. Hello and welcome everybody and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call are: Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors CFO; Leo Kiely, CEO of MillerCoors; Gavin Hattersley, CFO of MillerCoors; Kevin Boyce, CEO of Molson Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Dave Perkins, President of Global Brand and Market Development; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal Officer; Bill Waters, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "On the call today, Stewart and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2009 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of 2009.  As usual, we will include a review of financial results for MillerCoors.  Then, we will open it up for questions.", "So let\u2019s get started.", "In the first quarter, our strong brands, strategic initiatives, cost reductions and lower incentive compensation drove 75% profit growth for our company.  We also achieved positive pricing and local-currency profit growth in each of our major markets. These positive factors more than offset continuing commodity inflation, unfavorable currency movements, a higher tax rate, and lower volume, especially in the U.K.", "Our highlights for the quarter show the importance of building brands and reducing costs. In the first quarter: we increased worldwide Coors Light volume more than 4% from a year ago; in Canada, net pricing grew as price increases across all major markets more than offset higher price discounting, primarily in the Quebec market; in the U.K., based on our value-driven strategy, which is underpinned by our brand building focus, we delivered strong pricing growth and benefited significantly from our contract brewing arrangement and the expansion of Magners draught cider; MillerCoors made great progress in the U.S. on both the top-line and bottom-line, with an improving growth profile achieved for the total portfolio and for key brands.  At the same time, MillerCoors achieved underlying profit growth of nearly 50% versus the pro-forma result a year ago; we reduced corporate overhead and interest costs in the first quarter.", "So we are pleased with the bottom-line momentum we have achieved leading into the peak summer selling season, but we nonetheless remain cautious about the rest of the year due to uncertainty around currency exchange rates and beer market volume trends, plus continuing commodity inflation.", "So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review first quarter financial results and trends and then we\u2019ll cover the outlook for 2009.  Stewart, over to you.", "", "Stewart Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. I\u2019ll start with first quarter financial highlights.   Worldwide pro forma beer volume for Molson Coors declined 2.7% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness, primarily in the U.K. Meanwhile, our underlying pretax income increased 74% to $107.5 million. This increase was driven by earnings growth from MillerCoors and our U.K. business, along with lower long-term incentive compensation and interest expenses. ", "Foreign currency movements decreased this pretax profit by approximately $9 million in the first quarter, driven by a 20% year-over-year depreciation of the Canadian Dollar and a 28% depreciation of the British Pound versus the U.S. Dollar. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $98.8 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, was 75% higher than the first quarter a year ago. ", "It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings exclude some one-time expenses, particularly related to MillerCoors and our Foster\u2019s cash-settled total-return swap, as well net special charges of $10.2 million.  These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning.  ", "Also, our first quarter 2009 results reflect our adoption of new accounting standards for convertible debt (APB14) and \u201cNon-controlling Interests in Financial Statements\u201d (FAS160), as well as the adoption of hectoliters as our standard global volume measure.  Prior period results presented have been adjusted to reflect these changes.  ", "Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. Dollars.", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, our results benefited from positive net pricing, along with cost inflation impacts that were more than two-thirds lower than in the first quarter of 2008.  As a result, underlying pretax earnings in local currency grew more than 13% versus a year ago.  However, a 20% year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar resulted in lower reported Canada earnings in the quarter.", "In March this year, we discontinued our consolidation of Brewers Retail Inc., or BRI, which operates the Ontario beer stores. We began accounting for BRI results using the equity method of accounting because we are no longer the majority holder of financial interests in BRI, primarily due to our ownership interest being reduced following Labatt\u2019s acquisition of Lakeport Brewing in Ontario.  This change will decrease underlying Canada pretax income and Corporate interest expense a similar amount, yielding no significant impact on underlying consolidated income. ", "To provide more-comparable results, we will provide year-over-year changes that exclude the reporting effects in Canada of deconsolidating BRI and of setting up MillerCoors in 2008. ", "So, let\u2019s review the highlights.", "    ", "Canada underlying pretax income was $58.1 million in the first quarter, 9.4% lower than a year ago, as gains in the base business were more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.   The weakening Canadian dollar reduced Canada segment underlying income by approximately $12 million in the quarter.  Canada underlying pretax income in local currency was approximately 13% higher than a year ago, including the benefit of currency hedges. ", "    ", "Our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the calendar quarter ended March 31st decreased 3.2% versus a year ago, driven by soft industry volumes in the first quarter, along with our decision to limit our participation in off-premise price discounting.  STRs of our strategic brands, which represent more than 85% of our Canada volume, were stable, while sales of our non-supported brands declined.  Strategic brand changes were led by double-digit growth of Coors Light and mid-single-digit growth by Carling.  Partner import brands and Molson Canadian declined versus prior year.", "    ", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail declined an estimated 1.2% in the calendar first quarter.  Our estimated Canada market share decreased about three-quarters of a share point in the first quarter versus a year ago.", "    ", "Our Canada sales volume was 1.8 million hectoliters in the first quarter, virtually unchanged from a year ago.", "    ", "Comparable net sales per hectoliter increased 2% in local currency, driven by favorable net pricing, led by price increases across all major markets, partially offset by continued discounting activity. ", "    ", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter in the first quarter increased 2.4% on a comparable basis in local currency.  This increase was due to the net effect of three factors: one, higher commodity, packaging material, distribution and other input costs increased 2.5%; two, more than a third of these inflationary increases were offset by savings from our Resources for Growth initiatives; and three, an increase of about 1% was driven by increased overhead costs and ongoing product mix shifts.", "    ", "Comparable marketing general & administrative expense in the quarter decreased almost 6% in local currency, driven by lower overhead costs and cycling higher long-term incentive compensation in the prior year. ", "    ", "Other income increased due to $2.7 million of pretax gains from foreign currency hedges. ", "In the U.S., underlying U.S. segment pretax income increased 52% to $94.2 million in the first quarter, driven by strong underlying earnings growth by MillerCoors versus a year ago.  Note that U.S. segment results include our share of first quarter 2009 MillerCoors net income and various equity income adjustments, which are then compared to the year-earlier results reported by our legacy Coors business.", "Looking specifically at the total MillerCoors P&L in U.S. GAAP, which is compared to the prior year pro forma MillerCoors results, underlying net income for the quarter, excluding special items, increased 46% to $216.4 million from the prior year pro forma result. This earnings growth was driven by accelerated synergy delivery, strong revenue growth, disciplined cost management, and the timing of marketing spending, despite continuing commodity cost pressures.", "MillerCoors domestic STRs increased 0.4% versus the prior year pro forma quarter due to strong results from five of the six focus brands, offset primarily by declines in Milwaukee\u2019s Best and above-premium domestic brands.  Domestic sales-to-wholesalers,  STWs, declined 1% versus prior year, while total STWs declined 2%, driven by a double-digit reduction in contract brewing volumes.", "MillerCoors total net sales increased by 3.8% to $1.72 billion versus the prior pro forma quarter.  Pricing remained strong in the first quarter as domestic net sales per hectoliter, excluding contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 5.6% based on 2008 price increases in the first and fourth quarters, and reductions in discounting.  Pricing growth was lower than the previous quarter due to cycling of early 2008 general price increases. ", "Though MillerCoors continues to realize supply chain related synergies and deliver savings from its cost leadership programs -- Resources For Growth and Project Unicorn -- cost of goods sold, COGS, per hectoliter increased by 5.3% due to significant increases in brewing and packaging materials related to high commodity costs last year.", " ", "For the first quarter, marketing, general and administrative costs decreased by 9.1%, driven by timing and management of marketing and sales spending and the accelerated timing of synergy delivery.", "Now moving to our U.K. business in the first quarter, we achieved underlying pretax profit for the quarter of $3.5 million, an improvement of $5.5 million versus 2008. Driven by strong pricing growth, the ramp-up of our contract brewing arrangement, and reduced marketing and pension costs, this represents our best first quarter profit in the U.K. in five years.  The U.K. team achieved this improvement despite a 28% devaluation of the British Pound versus the U.S. dollar, which had a $2 million negative impact on U.K. pretax income.  ", "Looking at first quarter highlights: our U.K. owned-brand volume decreased 13.8% year-on-year, compared to a total industry decline of more than 8%, reflecting the impact of a weak economy in the U.K and our firm pricing stance with customers, especially in the off-premise, which is key to our strategy to grow margins. As a consequence of this stance, we lost market share in the quarter.", "    ", "Comparable net sales per hectoliter of our own products increased 11.6% in local currency, with approximately three-fourths of this driven by higher pricing in all channels, as we benefited from price increases implemented in 2008, combined with an additional price increase toward the end of the first quarter this year. The balance of the revenue per hectoliter increase was the result of positive sales mix, partly the result of growth in draught Magners cider. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year pricing growth for our U.K. business. For the second consecutive quarter, we achieved pricing growth ahead of input inflation, resulting in improved gross margins.   ", "Comparable cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 5.2% in local currency in the first quarter, primarily due to higher input cost inflation, partly offset by results of cost-reduction initiatives and lower pension costs. ", "    ", "Marketing, general & administrative expenses in the U.K. decreased 2.7% in local currency due to lower marketing and pension expense in the quarter.  ", "In the Global Markets and Corporate segment, our Global Markets team grew volume nearly 26% in the first quarter on a small base, driven by China and Europe. MG&A expense for Global Markets was $11 million in the quarter, an increase of $2.8 million versus a year ago.", "    ", "On the other hand, Corporate G&A expense declined $7.8 million to $21.1 million, due to lower long-term incentive compensation this year.   ", "    ", "First quarter Corporate interest expense declined $8.7 million from a year ago, with about $5 million of this reduction attributable to foreign currency movements and the balance due to the deconsolidation of BRI. Note that interest expense for the first quarter of 2008 has been increased $3.9 million retroactively in accordance with the new accounting rules for convertible debt.", "    ", "Corporate Other Expense of $21.9 million was driven by a non-cash, mark-to-market expense related to the cash-settled total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster\u2019s common stock. ", "    ", "The underlying loss for Global Markets and Corporate was $48.4 million pretax in the first quarter, a 22% decrease driven by lower Corporate G&A and interest expense this year.", "Now, highlights of our cost-reduction initiatives -- in the first quarter, we captured an incremental $18 million of cost savings as part of our three-year, $250 million Resources for Growth, or RFG, cost reduction initiative. These cost reductions include our 42% share of RFG cost savings initiatives that were assumed by MillerCoors, which equaled $3 million in the first quarter. In addition to RFG savings, MillerCoors delivered $50 million of incremental cost synergies in quarter. ", "Moving beyond operating business unit performance, our first quarter effective tax rate was negative 2% on a reported basis and positive 8% on an underlying basis.  These rates are lower than our expected annual rate for 2009 because of the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions in the quarter.", "    ", "The first quarter is generally a cash-use quarter because of the seasonality of the beer business.  Free cash flow for the first quarter reflected a net cash use of $80 million, which was made up of $5 million of operating cash flow, plus $2 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus capital spending of $20 million and $67 million of cash contributed to MillerCoors.  This free cash flow result was $88 million improved versus the first quarter of 2008 due to improved operating cash flow from the U.S. this year. ", "    ", "Total owned debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.57 billion.  Cash and cash equivalents totaled $94 million at the end of the first quarter, resulting in owned net debt of $1.47 billion.  ", "    ", "Looking forward, we continue to expect full-year 2009 marketing, general & administrative expense in the Corporate and Global Markets segment of approximately $150 million, plus or minus 5%.", "    ", "We anticipate full-year corporate interest expense of approximately $85 million to $90 million at today\u2019s foreign exchange rates, including the net effect of new accounting rules for convertible debt and the deconsolidation of BRI. ", "    ", "Turning to our effective tax rate, we continue to anticipate that our underlying tax rates for full-year 2009 will be in the range of 16% to 20%, assuming no further changes in tax laws.  Within the quarters, however, our tax rate will be volatile.  We currently anticipate underlying tax rates in the range of 24% to 28% in the second and third quarters and 4% to 8% for the fourth quarter this year. ", "    ", "Our capital spending outlook for 2009 continues to be approximately $140 million.  As usual, this guidance excludes MillerCoors.   ", " ", "Right -- at this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to 2009.  Peter.", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Thanks, Stewart. In 2009, we continue to focus on building strong brands, reducing costs in each of our businesses, and generating cash. In Canada, we made a conscious decision not to fully participate in some of the price discounting in Quebec during the first quarter, and this adversely affected our volume and share trends in that province.  ", "For the remainder of the year, we are confident that we can manage the business in a way that keeps us competitive in all markets, while generating sufficient profit to enable us to continue ongoing investment in our brands.", "In the U.S., the MillerCoors integration is proceeding well.  Specifically, the integration of business processes and systems is enabling faster local decision-making and streamlining of costs. The MillerCoors network optimization project is ahead of schedule, as are the planned brewing production relocations, with more than 60% completed by the beginning of April.  ", "In addition, construction of the new MillerCoors headquarters in Chicago is nearing completion, with an expected occupancy date in the third quarter of 2009.  Finally, the U.S. team is aggressively working to deliver against its stated goal of achieving $500 million of cost savings in the first three years of combined operations. ", "Our top priority in the U.S. is getting Miller Lite growing again. We believe that by focusing on taste, MillerCoors\u2019 new marketing program can get this great brand back on the path toward growth.  And as we enter the key summer selling season, MillerCoors plans to ramp up marketing spending on our brand portfolio to align package and product innovation with marketing messages that drive consumer trial, repeat and loyalty. The team will continue to accelerate Coors Light growth by driving its Rocky Mountain cold refreshment message with new marketing and cold activated cans. At retail, MillerCoors will have a number of major marketing programs lined up with chain partners to drive sales this summer.", "In the U.K., we anticipate a challenging trading environment to continue throughout 2009 due to a weak local economy, with commodity inflation also being a challenge. However, we believe that our U.K. business is now on much firmer footing as it benefits from our contract brewing arrangement, the Magners cider agreement, supplier renegotiations, and pricing negotiations with customers. ", "Moreover, our brand strength has consistently supported positive pricing, and we implemented a 2009 price increase in March. As a brand-led company, we continue to grow our investments behind our brands on a per-hectoliter basis.  Looking forward, we anticipate that performance comparisons with prior year will become more challenging in the second half of 2009 in the U.K., as we cycle the ramp up of our strategic initiatives in the second half of 2008.", "Following are the most recent volume results for each of our businesses early in the second quarter.", "    ", "In Canada, our comparable sales to retail in April decreased slightly versus a year ago.", "    ", "In the first four weeks of the second quarter, our U.K. sales to retail have increased at a low-single-digit rate due to the year-over-year change in the timing of the Easter holiday, along with improving weather. In the first four weeks of the second quarter in the U.S., MillerCoors has grown sales to retail at a low-single-digit rate compared to last year.", "In the area of cost outlook, by business: in Canada, we continue to expect our comparable 2009 cost of goods per hectoliter in local currency to increase at a low-single-digit rate versus 2008 due to inflationary pressures, partially offset by anticipated reductions in certain commodity and fuel inflation rates, as well as cost savings from our Resources for Growth initiatives. ", "    ", "Our U.K. team is targeting substantial reductions as part of the Resources for Growth program, driven by supplier negotiations and operational efficiencies. In a challenging industry volume environment, our view for the full year 2009 is that U.K. owned-brand cost of goods will increase at a high-single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency. This is driven by mid-single-digit inflation and production mix changes related to growth in contract brewing and Magners cider. These mix changes also increase net sales per hectoliter and are a benefit to gross profit.", "    ", "In the U.S., the MillerCoors team further accelerated synergy delivery timing, realizing $50 million in the first quarter, including some savings originally planned for the second quarter.  MillerCoors has now realized $78 million in synergy savings since being formed on July 1, 2008.  The U.S. team expects to realize $128 million of synergies by June 30 -- more than 2.5 times its original goal for the first 12 months of operations.  As a result, MillerCoors is more confident than ever that it can nail the synergies commitment on time, and the team is already developing the next generation of cost savings, with details to follow later this year.", "Finally, with regard to foreign currency impacts, if the Canadian Dollar and British Pound stay where they are today relative to the U.S. Dollar, we would face substantial currency translation challenges in the second and third quarters of 2009. At current rates, Canadian Dollar devaluation would present a Canada pretax earnings headwind of approximately 15% to 20% of prior-year earnings in each of the second and third quarters of 2009, with minimal impact in the fourth quarter.  It is important to note that we expect our debt structure and currency hedging programs to offset about 50% to 60% of this impact on pretax earnings in 2009.", "    ", "Also, at current rates, British Pound devaluation would negatively impact our U.K. pretax earnings by about 20% to 25% in the second and third quarters of the year, with a 5% to 10% impact in the 4th quarter.  We have no significant currency hedges focused on the British Pound exposure. ", "To summarize our results and discussion today, in the first quarter, our strong brands, strategic initiatives, cost reductions and lower incentive compensation drove 75% profit growth for our company. We also achieved positive pricing and local-currency profit growth in each of our major markets. These positive factors more than offset continuing commodity inflation, unfavorable currency movements, a higher tax rate, and lower volume, particularly in the U.K.  ", "We are pleased with our bottom-line momentum that we have achieved leading into the peak summer selling season, but we remain cautious about the rest of the year due to uncertainty around currency exchange rates and beer market volume trends, plus continuing commodity price inflation.", "For the balance of 2009, we will remain keenly focused on the fundamentals that drive results in this business.  ", "Our priorities are to build great beer brands and grow revenue per hectoliter; deliver cost savings on or ahead of our commitments; generate substantial free cash; and grow long-term returns to Molson Coors shareholders.  ", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment -- our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon.  Also, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, our Investor Relations team led by Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results.  That call will also be available for you to hear via web cast and recorded replay on our website.", "So at this point, Matthew, can we open it up for questions, please?", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Christine Farkas from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. I am hoping I can get a little bit more color on Canada. We are hearing, Kevin, a little bit more widespread discounting occurring in Quebec and it\u2019s of course hard to read across all the retailers what the depth of that is. Can you comment on the environment there and how it looks in other provinces? And just on the back of that, is there an Alberta tax that could impact industry volumes coming up? Thank you. ", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Thanks, Christine. Let\u2019s start with Quebec where I\u2019d say it\u2019s fair to say in the last three to four months, it\u2019s extended a little bit more into the independent trade. Having said that, there has been, as you are familiar with, there is a minimum price change every year in Quebec, so the minimum price has actually been adjusted up. And we took a fairly conservative approach early in the quarter, certainly as we went into March and April we\u2019ve adjusted our plans and we\u2019ve seen a nice bounce back in volume. So as we look forward, we\u2019ve got we believe the right programs in place. We\u2019ve adjusted our costs where appropriate. We continue to have good support, marketing, and sales support in our brands, so we are confident that the plans we have in place are the right mix of both driving equity but also being price competitive in that marketplace. ", "If you look across the rest of the provinces, I\u2019d say the general comment, pricing has been taken, that maybe discounting is a little bit more aggressive, a little bit in the west but I would have to say nothing in the context of what I think people are looking at with respect to Quebec and yes, there is a tax change in Alberta that was just enacted in the latest budget. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Now can you help me, Kevin, with the currency? I\u2019m under the impression there were some natural hedges but we are seeing a 20% hit on your profit line and also about a 20% hit on total TAP pretax, so I am trying to understand where there might have been a benefit. Can you give us the top line hit on Canadian FX and maybe how the rest of the P&L might have offset some of that increase?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Christine, if it\u2019s all right with you, can I switch that over to Stewart to answer that?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Certainly, certainly. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "Christine, just to highlight, there was about an $11.7 million FX impact on Canadian earnings for the quarter. Some of our hedges which we have in place actually flow through the Canadian P&L so that you can more easily see the net impact in Canada. There is a $2.7 million benefit coming through that P&L in the first quarter. It\u2019s also important to realize that   since a bunch of our debt is Canadian dollar denominated, we actually save on interest costs when the Canadian dollar depreciates, so as Peter mentioned, we\u2019ve got about 50% to 60% of the Canadian earnings covered but there\u2019s still a fair bit of exposure.  ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And last question, if I could, Peter, on your holdings in Fosters, I know there was a mark-to-market hit. Can you talk about the losses or the mark-to-market losses to date and if your view on this financial instrument or strategic interest has changed at all?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Yes, certainly, Christine. Our view on Fosters has been pretty consistent and it\u2019s not going to change, and that is that we like the flexibility of the cash settle swap. We reserve our right to either increase that or decrease it or stay the same and so really nothing has changed as far as we are concerned on Fosters.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy from Credit Suisse.", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Good morning, everyone. Peter, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on that previous question -- with [inaudible] arrangement, Labatt looks like it\u2019s renewed it for at least another year. Can you expand on your market response in terms of pricing, in terms of price caps for Coors Light in particular in Quebec?", "And I guess the big concern is, is there enough cost to cut out that you don\u2019t have to cut into market spending for Coors Light?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "I\u2019ll let Kevin give the details, Carlos, but I think just as a sort of a bit of context, if you like -- we have always taken the view in Quebec that we have a strong brand portfolio that will always be successful on a relative price platform and I think we\u2019ve proven that every time we step back in the market, so we are very comfortable about the strength of our brands in that market. And as I said, I think in the preamble, we always have had and will continue to have a bias to invest behind our brands, both in good and bad times, and we are not going to come off that. So I don\u2019t think we are going to talk about the detail about what we are doing, but I\u2019ll pass it over to Kevin just to give maybe a slightly more detailed perspective on Quebec. So Kevin.", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Thanks, Peter. Carlos, I think your first question was with respect to did Labatt\u2019s renew their deal or was a new deal put in place at Loblaws, and yeah, our understanding is there probably is another year. I would say that we are back in a more meaningful way in Loblaws, so we will see a different trend this year and that we looked at as positive. When you look at -- I think your second question about are we confident we can take out the costs so that we are not going to have to alter our brand support, the programs that we\u2019ve identified, both in Quebec and elsewhere, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve got the appropriate balance and that we will be able to put the amount of money that we think is necessary behind all of our brands in Quebec and indeed nationally. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "But have you had to cut back market spend though?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Market spend in the first quarter is pretty flattish with a year ago. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question in queue is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Kevin, just following up on Canada again, I think you had said the SPRs actually were down slightly in April, which suggests a sequential improvement in the first quarter. Is this driven by just more discounting or has the industry gotten a little bit better as we enter into the second quarter here?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "If you look, there\u2019s been two different aspects over the last four months. The first two months, January and February, were fairly soft. If you just took March and April together, March and April the industry has grown, as have our shipments. So clearly a bit of a soft start. There\u2019s a whole bunch of reasons -- leap year -- that we can all get into but I would say of late that the industry is better. I think there\u2019s still concern about the economy and we are seeing some trading down and a little bit -- a touch of softness here and there but when I talk about a touch, I\u2019m really talking about some very modest changes and certainly we are encouraged by what we\u2019ve seen in March and April. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then just on pricing, it sounds like as the quarter progressed, you\u2019ve become a little more aggressive on discounting. You\u2019ve talked about getting back in Loblaws with more discounting there. Is the 2% pricing in the first quarter, is that number going to moderate as the year progresses in terms of your initiatives with some of these discounting activities?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "I think it\u2019s important to remember that when you compare to a year ago on the first quarter, by and large the pricing activity in Quebec was much more benign, so as we go into the rest of the year, we will be cycling some of the spend that we did in the last nine months and specifically in the  summer time. ", "I don\u2019t fee comfortable giving you an estimate going forward but I think that was important background to get into, and a lot will depend on a combination of how everybody is doing in the marketplace, what the industry is performing like and to be honest, I don\u2019t think the weather last summer was very good, particularly on the weekends. So as we look forward, we\u2019d love some nice warm long weekend weather. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then Peter or Stewart, if we look at your tax rate, obviously the long-term tax rate is pretty low compared to other companies. To what extent would the current proposal by the administration in terms of changing the foreign taxes could have an impact on your long-term tax rate?", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Okay, well, two pieces there. I think given the current laws, we feel pretty confident that the guidance we have given you with respect to our tax rates is good. With respect to some of the recent announcements, we really haven\u2019t seen enough detail yet to be able to opine on the impacts specifically on our numbers and once we do see that detail, we will be able to share that with you. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then my last question, Stewart, just given the strong performance that you have seen in the first quarter, is there any changes to your cash flow outlook for the full year?", "Stewart Glendinning", "No, we are going to continue to hold to the numbers that we\u2019ve given you already. I think that\u2019s the place we feel comfortable with. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Currently I have no other questions in queue. (Operator Instructions) Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Canada is the topic du jour, I guess. A couple of more questions there -- the shipment number, flat STRs, down on the order of three -- what were the causes for that spread and what do you think that implies for the relationship in the second quarter and looking out?", "Kevin T. Boyce", "Mark, thanks for the question. Most of the shift was actually in the sub period between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, so there was a big shift versus the year before and that\u2019s the majority of the change, if you look at the biggest single drivers. That\u2019s the majority of the change, so that shouldn\u2019t affect the future periods, if you like. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Got it. Great. ", "Unidentified Participant", "", "You know, Mark, what Kevin is saying by step period is that\u2019s the -- potentially the difference in calendars for STWs versus the calendar for STRs, and particularly when you have a holiday like New Year\u2019s or Canada Day right on the crossover of a quarter, then you\u2019ll get some shifting there. What he\u2019s saying is it\u2019s not primarily an inventory issue. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then also, more on the financial side -- I don\u2019t know if this is for Stewart but you gave us the for-ex hedge benefit in the other income line, the $2.7 million. Was there also a benefit in Canadian COGS and if so, can you give us that amount?", "Stewart Glendinning", "We haven\u2019t provided any guidance on COGS, Mark. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. Is it fair to say there was a benefit?", "Stewart Glendinning", "We really haven\u2019t gone into any of the details around that. I think what we have shared with you is the $2.7 million, specifically in our specific hedge agreements. You are seeing that flow through there. I can\u2019t give you any specifics on the COGS. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay. And then back on the tax rate, could you just repeat what you said in your prepared remarks about how you see that laying out in the second and third quarter?", "Stewart Glendinning", "If you looked at our -- at the biggest impact on the volatility of our tax rates, it\u2019s related to the FIN-48 provisions, which requires us to put some of those liabilities on our books. As they unwind, that creates a lot of volatility in the numbers. If you then look at our number this quarter, it\u2019s obviously -- it\u2019s negative. It\u2019s very low because of the unwinding of some of that, we expect the range for the year will follow the guidance that we\u2019ve given you but specifically to your question, you will see in quarters two and three that --      two and three the rate will go up, we think somewhere between 24% and 28%, and then we expect that Q4 we\u2019ll see that come back down again to somewhere between 4% and 8%. Is that helpful?", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Yes. Thanks, Stewart. Thanks, Kevin. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Faucher of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ", "John Faucher - J.P. Morgan", "Yes, good morning, everyone. I was wondering if I could ask a question about the U.S. business. You talked a little bit about the potential for improvement in Miller Lite, so can you talk a little bit about the order of magnitude expectation there? And then also, as I look at successful campaigns in light beer over the past decade or so, it seems to be more sort of specific attribute focused, whether it\u2019s low carb or cold, what have you. And I guess what\u2019s going to be different about taste this time, which doesn\u2019t really seem like it\u2019s been a big motivating factor in this segment over the past decade or so? Thanks. ", "Leo Kiely", "Tom, are you on the line? ", "Unidentified Participant", "", "Yes. ", "Leo Kiely", "Do you want to take that?", "Unidentified Participant", "", "Sure. You know, the light trend improved from around minus 7 to minus 4.5 in the first quarter versus fourth quarter last year and as you know, we shed some rented volume, particularly out in the west, and did a pretty good job of net revenue management with Miller Lite. In fact, for the last two quarters, the net revenue per barrel on Miller Lite has been the strongest in our portfolio. And that\u2019s been the result of letting this portfolio work and finding the right balance in each of the markets. ", "Now, you know, of course minus 4.5 is below our original aspirations but the trend line is getting better and our April numbers are even better and sales of that Miller Lite pint and aluminum pint have been accelerating, so we are ambitious for the brand and we expect the trend to continue to improve throughout the year. ", "In terms of your point about the evolution of light beers, you know, functionality combined with an emotional reason to buy tends to work, and you are right -- a functional point of difference has worked. Miller Lite has had great taste since its inception and we brought that back to life with a real reason to believe called Triple Hopps Brewing, which we are seeding, and we\u2019ll move that campaign on through with some innovation around the taste, the taste protector lid and some other innovations in the package this summer and we\u2019ll follow it up and balance it out with some more emotionally driven advertising, which we showed our distributors in March called taste greatness.  ", "So we think we\u2019ll have a good combination of functional benefits and emotional reasons to drink. But most of this decline in Miller Lite is really not about the change in positioning -- it\u2019s really about a change in strategy and how we have Miller Lite work with the portfolio -- how it and  Coors Light and MGD64 work together to create a portfolio of really strong light beers with clear positions. ", "So that\u2019s the context I\u2019d hope you take Miller Lite\u2019s position in. ", "John Faucher - J.P. Morgan", "Great. Thanks.  ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you and thanks for taking the follow-up. Stewart, I\u2019m wondering if you can help me with the joint venture accounting, if you will. It looks like on your cash flow, there was about an 86% pay-out of those distributions into cash. Can you maybe help us with how much CapEx there was in the JV, and depreciation? I believe that flowed through that line -- just help me reconcile that. ", "And then on the back of that, the depreciation that Molson Coors adds below the line in terms of their share of the MillerCoors earnings is very volatile. We\u2019ve seen $3 million added back in the first quarter -- very different than the $36 million added back in the second half of \u201908. How does that look for the rest of the year and once we anniversary the depreciation, does that line go to zero? Thank you. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "Let\u2019s take the first part of your question and I think we will just need to revisit the second part, but if you first look at our cash distribution arrangements with the joint venture, we basically are receiving payments from the joint venture which closely correspond to their EBITDA, plus or minus any changes that come through in working capital, so you will see that\u2019s the 80 or so, $84 million that we took in this period, all right?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "So that does closely correspond and obviously there\u2019s some working capital impact there.                     The cash that went after MillerCoors, $67 million, is reflective of the various CapEx needs that MillerCoors had and that will encompass both of their synergy [target] spending as well as their regular CapEx requirements. So hopefully that answers the first part. ", "I\u2019m sorry, can you give me the second part of your question again?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Sure but on the first part, the cash that went out, the $67 million, that\u2019s not included in the distribution line or in your CapEx line on your cash flow statement, correct?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Well, we -- it will show up in two places. I mean, the cash flow that we get back from them will show up in our cash flows from operating activities, so that\u2019s $84 million coming in. The CapEx, the cash flows going back to them will go out as cash flows from investing activities. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so that $67 million includes CapEx that you would\u2019ve put into in the quarter?", "Stewart Glendinning", "That is correct. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then the second part was really just about the depreciation  below the line of what you add back in, pulling into Molson Coors, the depreciation number was near $30 million in the fourth quarter but $3 million  in the first. I\u2019m just wondering how to model that going forward. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "Yeah, you\u2019re talking about with respect to MillerCoors?", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s right, for MillerCoors and then pulling it into -- right, for MillerCoors and then the Molson Coors share. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "We actually don\u2019t have that in any separate lines, so the only two lines that will be affected relative to MillerCoors\u2019 cash flow were the two that I just highlighted. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks for that. ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) I\u2019m showing no further questions from the phone lines. ", "Peter Swinburn", "", "Okay. Thank you very much, Matthew. Thank you, everyone, for joining us and thanks for your interest in Molson Coors. We will no doubt speak to some of you in the interim, but probably mostly we will speak to you at the next quarter results. Thanks very much. Thank you, Matthew. ", "Operator", "Thank you.

As usual, we will include a review of financial results for MillerCoors and then we will open it up for questions.", "So let\u2019s get started -- overall, Molson Coors delivered a good performance in the second quarter, with underlying earnings growing more than 20% versus a year ago.  We grew local-currency revenue per hectoliter and profits in all of our markets. ", "Looking at regional highlights: in Canada, revenue per hectoliter grew as front-line price increases in all major markets were partially offset by higher promotional activity across Canada. ", "In the U.K., our team drove 70% pretax profit growth via strong pricing in all major channels and also achieved excellent cost management.", "MillerCoors continued to achieve strong double-digit bottom-line growth in the U.S., driven by cost synergy delivery, solid pricing and lower marketing and general and administrative spending.", "These positive results were due to excellent cost control and front-line price management, underpinned by well-executed strategic initiatives. Our ability to build long-term brand value, manage costs, and generate meaningful cash continues to deliver strong results.", "Meanwhile, tougher markets, poor weather and our strong pricing stance led to a 3.2% decline in overall company volumes, though within this we grew Coors Light volumes worldwide by 3%.  We also faced continuing cost inflation and unfavorable currency movements.", "The U.K. beer industry continued to post poor volume figures, and there was increasing evidence in both the U.S. and Canadian markets of some consumers moving to enhanced value propositions -- in other words, looking for value in brands, package configurations and channels.", "Despite a difficult economic and competitive environment, we are very pleased with the progress we achieved in the first half of this year but we expect the balance of 2009 to present continued challenges as consumers continue to seek value and markets remain subdued.  As in the first half, we will address these issues by continuing to focus on our brands, costs and cash generation.", "So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review the  second quarter financial results and trends and then we\u2019ll cover the outlook for the back half of 2009.   Stewart, all yours.", "", "Stewart Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. I\u2019ll start with the second quarter financial highlights.   Worldwide pro forma beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.2% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in our major geographies, as well as our revenue-generation strategy in the U.K. Meanwhile, our underlying pretax income grew 16.3% to $264 million.  This increase was driven by strong earnings growth from MillerCoors and our U.K. business, along with lower interest expense. ", "Foreign currency movements decreased pretax profit by approximately $21 million in the second quarter. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $205.4 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, was 20.6% higher than the second quarter a year ago. ", "It is important to note that our second quarter underlying earnings exclude some one-time expenses, primarily related to MillerCoors and our Foster\u2019s cash-settled total-return swap, as well as net special charges of $7.1 million.  These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning.  Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars.", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income in local currency grew 2% versus a year ago as a result of positive net pricing and the benefit of cost savings initiatives, which more than offset inflation impacts in the quarter. However, underlying income in U.S. dollars declined due to an $18 million foreign currency headwind. ", "As on our last earnings call, to provide more-comparable results in our Canada discussions, we will exclude the reporting effects in Canada of deconsolidating Brewers Retail Inc., or BRI, and of setting up MillerCoors in 2008. ", "So, let\u2019s review the highlights -- Canada underlying pretax income was $137.3 million in the second quarter, 11% lower than a year ago as local currency profit was offset by a 13% year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.   ", "Our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the calendar quarter ended June 30th decreased 0.5% versus a year ago.  STRs of our strategic brands, which represent more than 85% of our Canada volume, increased almost 2%, while sales of our other brands declined at a double-digit rate. Strategic brand growth was led by high-single-digit growth of Coors Light and solid growth by Rickard\u2019s.  Molson Canadian declined at a mid-single-digit rate versus prior year.", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail increased an estimated 1.8% in the calendar second quarter, yielding year-to-year industry growth of 0.5%.  As a result, our estimated Canada market share decreased about 0.9 of a share point in the second quarter versus a year ago.", "Our Canada sales volume was 2.4 million hectoliters in the second quarter, down 2.9% from a year ago.  The difference between our volume and STR trends is driven by the timing of the July 1 Canada Day holiday within our fiscal calendar, along with a decrease in retailer inventories of import brands.", "Comparable net sales per hectoliter increased 2.6% in local currency, driven by front-line price increases in all major markets and improved sales mix, partially offset by promotional activity across Canada. ", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter in the second quarter increased 1.7% on a comparable basis in local currency.  This increase was due to the net effect of three factors: one, commodity, packaging material, distribution and other input costs increased COGS per hectoliter about 2.5 percentage points;  second, an increase of about 2 percentage points was driven by ongoing product mix shifts; and finally, savings from our resources for growth initiatives more than offset inflation in the quarter, reducing cost of goods sold per hectoliter by 3 percentage points.", "Comparable marketing general & administrative expense in the quarter decreased approximately 1% in local currency, driven by lower overhead costs. ", "Other income increased $3.9 million due to foreign currency gains. ", "In the U.S., underlying U.S. segment pretax income increased 26.5% to $142.7 million in the second quarter, driven by strong underlying earnings growth by MillerCoors versus a year ago.  Note that U.S. segment results include our share of second quarter 2009 MillerCoors net income and various equity income adjustments, which are then compared to the year-earlier results reported by our legacy Coors business.", "Looking specifically at the total MillerCoors P&L, second quarter underlying net income increased 16.4% to $325.3 million from the prior year pro forma MillerCoors result. This earnings growth was driven by strong net revenue growth, cost management and continued synergy delivery, despite continuing commodity cost pressures.", "           ", "In a soft beer market, MillerCoors domestic STRs decreased 0.8% versus the prior year pro forma quarter due to a decline in Miller Lite STRs and softness in above-premium brands, mostly offset by positive results in five of our six focus brands in the U.S.  Domestic sales-to-wholesalers declined 1.1% driven by lower STRs and a slight reduction in distributor inventories.", "MillerCoors total net sales increased by 1.6% to $2.14 billion versus the prior year pro forma quarter.  Pricing remained strong in the second quarter as domestic net sales per hectoliter, excluding contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased by 3% based on 2008 price increases.", "Though MillerCoors continues to realize supply-chain-related synergies and deliver savings from its cost leadership programs, cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased by 5.1% due to cycling significant prior year hop sales, as well as increased brewing and packaging-material costs this year, primarily glass, aluminum and barley. Profits from hops sales were $24.3 million lower in the second quarter versus a year ago, when these hops sales were unusually high.", "Marketing, general and administrative costs decreased by 10.8% in the second quarter, driven by synergies and other cost savings.", "Moving to our U.K. business in the second quarter, we achieved underlying pretax profit for the quarter of $36.8 million, an increase of $15.3 million, or 70%, versus 2008.  This solid quarterly performance was driven by positive results from the strategic actions our U.K. team has taken in the past year, including supplier negotiations and leveraging our contract brewing arrangement and brand building efforts, which allowed us to forgo low-margin volume.  The benefit of these actions was partially offset by lower volume and higher marketing, general and administration expenses in the quarter. The U.K. team achieved this improvement despite a 22% devaluation of the British Pound versus the U.S. dollar, which had a $10 million negative impact on U.K. underlying income.  In local currency, second quarter U.K. underlying pretax earnings increased nearly 118% from a year ago. ", "Looking at second quarter highlights, our U.K. owned-brand volume decreased 12.4% in the quarter due to a soft industry and the company\u2019s strategy to forgo low-margin volume.  U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 5% in the second quarter, reflecting the weak economy in that market.", "Comparable net sales per hectoliter of our own products increased 19.8% in local currency, with approximately three-quarters of this driven by higher pricing in all channels, as we benefited from our strategy to forgo low-margin volume. The balance of the revenue per hectoliter increase was the result of positive sales mix, primarily due to growth in draught Magners cider and favorable channel mix. We achieved pricing growth ahead of input inflation, resulting in improved gross margins.   ", "Comparable cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products was virtually unchanged versus 2008 in local currency, reflecting higher input cost inflation and fixed-cost de-leverage as a result of lower volumes, offset by favorable channel mix and cost-reduction savings. ", "Marketing, general & administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 10.1% in local currency due to higher marketing and incentive compensation expenses in the quarter.  ", "In the Global Markets and Corporate segment, our Global Markets team grew volume more than 18% in the second quarter on a small base, driven by China and Europe.  MG&A expense for Global Markets was $12.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $3.3 million versus a year ago. In addition, Corporate general & administrative expense increased $4.7 million to $30.6 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and project spending this year.

Savings from the RFG program during the past two-and-a-half years now total $229 million.

If we exclude one-time cash uses by MillerCoors to capture synergies, along with the return of collateral cash related to MillerCoors commodity hedges, our underlying free cash flow totaled $229 million for the 1st half of this year.

This rate is lower than our previous guidance due to some adjustments in our inter-company financing to reflect recent changes in the global interest-rate environment. Within the quarters, however, our tax rate will be volatile.  We currently anticipate underlying tax rates in the range of 21% to 25% in the 3rd quarter and negative 15% to 19% for the 4th quarter this year. The negative 4th quarter rate is driven by the anticipated favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions in that quarter.", "We continue to anticipate that we will achieve our goal of generating $575 million of underlying free cash flow this year, plus or minus 10%.

", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on Canada and I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in terms of the industry volume trends. It looks like in the second quarter, the volume trend was actually pretty strong for the industry as a whole and then it sort of weakened in July, so I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color in terms of what\u2019s happening at the industry level. ", "And then it sounds like as you look out in the back half, you are trying to address your market share issue in Canada more broadly, and so I wanted to get a little more color there with respect to the promotional activity that you are seeing both within Quebec and outside of Quebec and as you think about the back half, whether I\u2019m interpreting it correctly that you are thinking about stepping up promotions more actively. ", "Peter Swinburn", "Well, I\u2019ll pass it over to Dave in a minute, Judy, to take the detail but maybe sort of a general point -- we recognize, despite the fact that [our figures] are good and strong for the first half of the year, there\u2019s some things we\u2019ve got to do in all our markets. We need to get Miller Light moving in the direction we want it moving in the U.S. and that\u2019s looking good at the moment but we\u2019ve got much more work to do. ", "We recognize in the U.K., we\u2019ve got to address the off-trade but we\u2019ve built a really solid base for ourselves to do that and we are confident we can do it. And similarly in Canada, I think the issue there is that we really do need to offer our consumers more options in terms of value propositions, and we\u2019ve got plans to do that and you\u2019ll see more of that happening in the second half of the year. But with that as background, I\u2019ll pass it on to Dave. ", "Dave Perkins", "Thanks, Peter. So Judy, on the industry, you\u2019ll remember in the first quarter it was down about 1.2% and then up 1.8 in the second quarter, so year-to-date is a half-a-point up and I think that\u2019s probably a decent reflection. There\u2019s noise in between the two quarters so I would tend to look at it on a year-to-date basis. ", "What I\u2019ve seen since coming back to Canada is that boy, the weather sure seems to have deteriorated over the years and it is a cool summer and I think that\u2019s the biggest factor that we are seeing in July. You know, that\u2019s anybody\u2019s bet obviously on how that plays out through the rest of the summer. ", "On the market share, I would comment, picking up on Peter\u2019s point, no question in the current economy we see consumers watching their pennies and they are really responding to the value propositions out there and we have seen a pick-up on that front and so I think the challenge for us going forward is really to find that right balance between pricing, volume, and brand equity. That\u2019s what we will be focused on for the second half. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "On the competitive activity, Dave, just to follow-up on that, it sounds like up until maybe the first quarter, the competitive situation or heightened competitive activity was really more limited to Quebec and -- are you now saying that you are seeing that sort of spreading out to other provinces in Canada more broadly?", "Dave Perkins", "Yeah, I would say the second quarter activity was certainly up from prior year. I think that is a reflection of the consumers\u2019 interest in these value proposition. ", "Peter Swinburn", "But just to build on that, Judy, as well -- I mean, I think the Quebec issue was specific to one competitor but if you look across the whole of Canada and you look at how the market share movements are going, the third players are actually with the lower prices are doing quite well as well, so this is a broad sort of response of consumers to available pricing out there. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then Stewart, a couple of questions -- first on the tax rate, I understand this year you are getting the benefit of some resolutions coming in at 10%, 14%. How should we think about that in the context of your long-term tax rate of 24% to 26%?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Well, I think Judy, just to answer your question, I don\u2019t think we are going to see a change in the long-term but we would try to give you some specific quarterly guidance this year because of the kind of volatility that we expect. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then Stewart, on the cash flow outlook, you\u2019ve cited some of the potential cash uses that you are not including as part of the $575 million underlying cash flow target. Can you quantify how much the potential cash uses on those other items could be this year? ", "Stewart Glendinning", "Well, let\u2019s just take it in two pieces -- I mean first of all, a couple of things I mentioned, we excluded last year from our cash and we\u2019ll exclude them this year. So for example, we are taking a benefit this year from the MillerCoors aluminum hedges which are now being closed out. We had to post a cash collateral at year-end. That\u2019s coming back in the benefit to our cash flow. We have not counted that in achieving our 575, so we took that -- we are taking the same treatment as in last year. ", "The piece that I mentioned in terms of additional potential cash use was related to a tax liability that we have in Brazil, our old business -- look, it\u2019s great news. We\u2019ve got a liability down there. The Brazilian Government have come out with a tax amnesty program. Our shift in our balance sheet from long-term liabilities to short-term liabilities reflects our belief that this will be resolved in the shorter term. But with respect to the specific amounts, I can\u2019t really point to an amount at this point in time because those are liabilities in which we guarantee a third party and we are still in the midst of discussions with that third party to try and resolve the actual amount. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Is the amount potentially large enough that you may be rethinking about maybe a potential use of cash from your cash flow, whether it\u2019s share buy-back or other uses of cash?", "Stewart Glendinning", "You know, I would say for all of these things, Judy, we\u2019ve got an ongoing dialog with the board. There are always movements in the cash balance and at this point, we really don\u2019t have a perspective on exactly what the number is so it\u2019s very difficult for me to answer that question. I would suggest that obviously when you get a chance to see our Q, you look at some of the footnotes. I think that will help give you a little bit of color. ", "Peter Swinburn", "Again, Judy, I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent that we will look to use our cash in the very best interest of our shareholders and to resolve this ongoing liability, we\u2019ve got the opportunity to do it in the right way would be an excellent use of cash. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from  Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Good afternoon, everybody. Peter, some of your comment on Miller Light and the new campaign is that you are seeing some positive signs but we are not seeing volumes improve -- in fact sequentially, they appear to be getting worse, so what are some of the things that you are seeing and what you are studying that we are not as it relates to reversing trends in the brand?", "Peter Swinburn", "Okay, well, I\u2019ll pass it over to Leo to give you the fine detail but there\u2019s no doubt that in the core purchase pattern of Miller Light, we are seeing improvements, which is always a good sign. It\u2019s really too early, I think, to get any sort of brand equity scores back on the advertising but certainly it\u2019s resonating in terms of top of mind to a much greater extent. ", "But I mean, there\u2019s been a lot that\u2019s been done to that brand in terms of pricing and so on to stabilize it but Leo, can I pass it over to you to take that further?", "Leo Kiely", "The trends haven\u2019t changed materially for I think pretty understandable reasons. We got into the second quarter, there was, particularly in some segments of the country a year ago very aggressive discounting going on in the big trade segment, so overlapping that has had an affect. Our pricing, however, since we moved last October has been very steady and our level of discounting continues to show productivity, which I think in some sense when you start to look at the non-promoted brand trends come up underneath it are an indication of just how big this franchise is and how responsive it is once you get things moving in the right direction. ", "But look, it\u2019s early days, we\u2019ve got work to do on the copy front to sharpen the message. We know that. We know the message is resonating from a top line awareness point of view and we would hope to see progress as we come out of this year and go into next year. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christine Farkas of Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much. A couple of questions. Firstly on the U.K., can you talk about the sustainability of this huge increase or price increase year over year -- what does the underlying rate look like on a comp basis, and will we see this 19% for the second half of the year?", "Peter Swinburn", "Again, I\u2019ll sort of take it first and I\u2019ll pass it on to Mark in a minute -- I mean obviously, we are not going to project what our pricing is going to be for the second half of the year but you will remember that we took a price increase in September last year in the U.K. so we have to cycle that. And the only other thing I would point to is that with some of these price agreements, with the major on-trade retailers, they are actually long-term price agreements, so they run for three years and they\u2019ve got [steppers], so they are locked into that extent. ", "But Mark, do you want to put more color around that?", "Mark Hunter", "I think what you have to remember is we have now seen 10 consecutive quarters of price improvement and the step-up that we\u2019ve seen, to Peter\u2019s point, was because of the additional price increase that we took last year. And that was really to drive those into position where we were starting to see gross margin growth, which we hadn\u2019t seen in our business, so we\u2019ve not see three consecutive quarters of gross margin growth. ", "I would expect to see the magnitude of pricing continue at the rate we\u2019ve seen for the last couple of quarters as we lap the additional price increase from last year. But in a market that continues to shrink, and with the continued pressure we are seeing around responsible drinking, our view is that continuing on this path and staying true to our strategy is absolutely the correct thing to do. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Now, correct me if I\u2019m wrong but industry data coming out for the second quarter showed that on-premise volumes appeared to have been slightly less bad than the second quarter. Is that fair? Are you seeing such trends?", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll call a party because things are going less bad but certainly the trend has improved. The interesting thing is really since the middle of last year, so Q3 of 2008, we\u2019ve now seen four consecutive quarters of decline in the off-trades, ranging from 5% to 10%. On-trade has improved but certainly in the second quarter, it was still ticking down at just under 5%, so total industry remains very challenging. On a year-to-date basis, volumes are down about 6%. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thanks for that. Moving to North America and looking at the Canadian first half industry growth of a half-a-point versus the U.S., down about a point, I\u2019m just wondering how when you look at the two markets, perhaps one is lagging the other, perhaps one is seeing greater price strength than the other -- can you maybe talk about why the Canadian market has held up a big better than the U.S. so far?", "Dave Perkins", "Well, I can\u2019t really provide the comparison to the U.S. I know as we look at what\u2019s going on in Canada, I think frankly some of the promotional value that is being delivered to the consumers is in fact helping with industry volume. ", "Peter Swinburn", "Leo, do you have any comment on the U.S.?", "Leo Kiely", "No, I wouldn\u2019t have a sense of why there would be a difference, Peter. ", "Peter Swinburn", "Yeah, to be honest with you, Christine, these things, if you look at the sort of the four weekly cycles or the quarterly cycles, they do move around quite a bit, so Canada has been a bit strong and it\u2019s not significant, I wouldn\u2019t think.  ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks for that and then Peter, I\u2019ll ask the question as I did last quarter with respect to your Foster stake -- has there been a change at all in your indirect ownership in that or has your perspective change of the Australian market?", "Peter Swinburn", "No, no, our position has not changed at all and I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent in our commentary on Fosters and if I were to repeat it, I would just be saying what I\u2019ve said in the past, Christine. ", "Christine Farkas - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess first, Stewart, as relates to FX transactionally speaking in Canada, I think in the first quarter it was a net negative, how those hedges worked out for you. Can you tell us, was it a net negative in terms of dollar impact on the U.S. dollar profits in the second quarter? And then as you look at the balance of the year, how do you think given where rates are right now for FX, what do you think kind of impact we\u2019ll see from those hedges transactionally?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Okay, well, I think if you just reflect on our quarter for our hedges, actually our hedges would have been positive this quarter but let\u2019s just -- let\u2019s just look at the top level of this thing. Canadian dollar, down about 13%, impact overall just from FX for the quarter about $18 million. I think if you looked at the outlook and looking forward for the rest of the year, as we\u2019ve shared with you we do have an active hedging program which hedges certain currency flows between Canada and the U.S. We also have a large proportion of our debt is denominated in Canadian dollars, which does provide a natural hedge against that. And if you take all that into account, you should expect that we have about 50% of our Canadian profits for the back half of the year are hedged. ", "Also I think if you looked forward and looked at where current rates sit as against the rates last year, you will find current rates are about 4% lower than last year and I think you will find that the fourth quarter we start to cycle that and you will see actually current rates being stronger than they were in the fourth quarter last year by about 12%. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay, helpful. And from a -- zeroing in specifically on this transactional issue, which seems to swing from quarter to quarter, which is -- whether it\u2019s beneficial or adverse, very understandable but knowing what you know right now about how those hedges are priced and given where the rates are right now, do you expect that that\u2019s going to be a net positive or a net negative of any -- at least of any size in the second half for your Canadian profits, dollar denominated -- U.S. dollar denominated?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Mark, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given anybody any specific pricing on our hedges, and I think again, I would go back to the comments I just gave you -- if you looked at our rates for the third quarter, it will still be slightly down on last year, fourth quarter looking a lot better. ", "Dave Dunnewald", "Mark, you know that our hedging program is essentially designed to mitigate volatility in our earnings, to the extent we can. So when Stewart mentioned that we expect a very slight FX headwind from a translational standpoint in the third quarter, that means the hedges ought to provide just a little bit of benefit, right? And then in the fourth quarter when that flips to a little bit of a tailwind from a translational standpoint, then you would expect the hedges to provide a little bit of headwind. In other words, take a little bit of that benefit off. We can\u2019t give specifics but I think that\u2019s the philosophy. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Excellent. Thank you, guys. And if I could just shift more to the business in Canada, Dave -- other Dave, you\u2019re new there, running that business. Talked a little bit, we\u2019ve heard a little from you here about your intentions with value offerings but could you give us kind of a broader report card on what you are seeing there, in terms of how you guys go to market that you think needs to change? And then operationally, incentive, compensation, anything else about how you guys actually run your business and motivate the people running the business to achieve better results going forward. ", "Dave Perkins", "I think the -- really the key opportunity for us in Canada going forward is around the long-term brand building and as I come back into the business in Canada and I look at the things that we have that we can leverage, I mean, we have an incredible portfolio there that plays against all consumer needs. We have a corporate reputation that\u2019s really strong and we have passionate employees that I think would go through a wall for the company. And for me, it\u2019s really around taking the portfolio to the next level and I think that\u2019s around the sorts of things we talked about as an enterprise -- innovation that we do behind our key brands, continuing to leverage Coors Light, which is really critical to us and doing very, very well in Canada, and addressing Molson Canadian, which I think we\u2019ve acknowledged in the past is a brand that requires some work. And I can tell you that our marketing team has shared with me in recent weeks some really exciting thinking they are doing on the brand that will come to fruition over the next six months or so and that\u2019s around the positioning on the brand and the programming, and I\u2019ve been around Molson Canadian for many, many years and this is some really solid thinking, and so I feel good about that. ", "So for me, it really is continuing to drive against taking our portfolio to another level. ", "As far as the people aspect of this in incentives, you know, I feel good about what we are doing there. I think our employees are clearly aligned behind what we need to do. With value brought in line and with continuing to add excitement on our brands, I think we\u2019ll be in a really good place. ", "So I don\u2019t see the need for changes in that aspect today. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great, and if I could, one last thing -- on the competitive landscape, in my opinion, I don\u2019t know if this is accurate, it\u2019s been somewhat imbalanced, the level of commodity benefits you versus Labatt and others have had over the last 12 months. Of course, you\u2019re not sitting inside their P&L but as you kind of look out and think about how the commodity hedges have affected behavior over the last 12 months and might affect behavior on price over the next 12 months, what -- do you have a sense of how much of a level playing field that\u2019s going to create or not level playing field it might create over the next 12 months?", "Dave Perkins", "That would be a very difficult thing for me to comment on. I think -- you know, I\u2019d come back to the consumer, Mark and from my perspective, we\u2019re seeing the consumer responding to value propositions. I think as the economy drags along, we\u2019ll likely see that adjust and so the way I would look forward I think on this is that it will come from the consumer.

Morgan ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Ross Turner - Pelham", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Molson Coors Brewing Company 2009 third quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) ", "Before we get started, we want to paraphrase the company\u2019s Safe Harbor language.  Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K, 10-Q and proxy filings for a more-complete description of factors that could affect these projections.  The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.  ", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call, please visit the company\u2019s website -- www.molsoncoors.com -- for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.  ", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Peter Swinburn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Molson Coors Brewing. Sir, you may begin. ", "Peter Swinburn", "Thanks very much, Matthew. Hello and welcome, everybody and thanks for joining us today. With me on this call are:  Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors CFO; Leo Kiely, CEO of MillerCoors; Gavin Hattersley, CFO of MillerCoors; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal Officer; Bill Waters, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors Vice President of Investor Relations. ", "On the call today, Stewart and I will take you through the highlights of our third quarter and year-to-date 2009 results and also will give you some perspective on the fourth quarter of 2009.  As usual, we will include a review of financial results for MillerCoors.  Then, we will open it up for questions.", "Molson Coors had a successful third quarter, with underlying earnings growing more than 22% versus a year ago. This headline profit has some non-operating and unusual noise in the numbers due to the favorable resolution of tax positions, partially offset by unfavorable currency and one-off headwinds. Stewart will take you through the details but given the economic and industry challenges, we are pleased with the performance of our company in the third quarter.", "Our results reflect a high level of brand investment, coupled with strong cost control and price management.  They also show the effects of weak industry volume trends and continued cost inflation, along with more promotional pricing activity in Canada.  ", "In terms of our portfolio performance, total-company volume in the third quarter declined, and worldwide Coors Light volumes were down slightly against a strong growth quarter a year ago.", "Looking at the regional headlines, in Canada comparable revenue per hectoliter and gross margin grew as front-line price increases outpaced growth in promotional activity and cost of goods sold.   Lower volume and increased brand investments, however, resulted in a 2% decline in local currency earnings.", "Our U.K. team also reinvested higher revenue per hectoliter in its brands, while growing pretax profit in local currency more than 20% in the quarter.  Also, the newly acquired Cobra brand got off to a good start in the quarter.", "MillerCoors achieved its 5th consecutive quarter of strong double-digit profit growth in the U.S., driven by cost synergy delivery, solid pricing and lower marketing general and administrative spending. Equally important, the U.S. brand portfolio performed well in the peak summer selling season against its competitive set.", "We remain focused on building a diverse portfolio of extraordinary brands, offering value-enhancing innovations for consumers and achieving positive pricing to grow our top-line and bottom-line as the economy improves.  In a few minutes, I will give you a flavor for the investments we are making in brand building and innovation across our business as we close out 2009 and enter 2010.", "We continue to achieve significant success in generating cash and leveraging our capital base to increase returns.  At the end of the third quarter, we have already achieved more than 90% of our $575 million free cash flow goal for the full year. ", "In terms of leveraging our capital base, we recently announced the sale of our ownership interest in the Montreal Canadiens hockey club and our intent to buy Granville Island Brewing Company of British Columbia.  The Granville Island acquisition, which we expect to close early in 2010, will represent a high-return addition to our super-premium portfolio.  When combined with our Ontario-based Creemore Springs Brewery, the Granville Island brands will position us for additional growth in the Canada craft and specialty segment. ", " ", "So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review third quarter financial results and trends and then we\u2019ll cover the outlook for the final quarter of 2009.  Stewart.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. I\u2019ll start with third quarter financial highlights.   Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 2.9% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in our major geographies, as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $212.9 million, or $1.14 per diluted share, was 22.7% higher than the third quarter a year ago. ", "As Peter mentioned, the headline profit result has some non-operating and unusual noise in the numbers, so it is helpful to look below the surface. Headwinds in the third quarter included unfavorable year-over-year currency movements, a mark-to-market hedge loss this year, and supplier negotiation benefits last year both in the U.K. These headwinds totaled more than $22 million pretax in the quarter, with foreign currency making up $13 million of this total. Meanwhile, our underlying results benefited from the favorable resolution of some unrecognized tax positions, which increased $36.4 million versus a year ago. ", "If we take these factors out of our underlying results to get a better view of the ongoing performance of the business, after-tax earnings increased approximately 13% in the quarter.", "It is important to note that our third quarter underlying earnings do exclude some one-time gains and expenses, primarily related to our Foster\u2019s cash-settled total-return swap and MillerCoors integration costs, as well as net special charges of $4.3 million.  These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning.  Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. Dollars.", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income in local currency declined 2% versus a year ago.  Positive net pricing and the benefit of cost savings initiatives were offset by declines in volume and higher MG&A expenses, driven by increased brand investment and the deconsolidation of our interest in the beer stores in Ontario, known as Brewers Retail Inc., or BRI.  ", "In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying earnings of $139.3 million in the third quarter declined 7.7% due to an approximate 6% year-over-year decline in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. The weaker Canadian dollar this year reduced Canada segment underlying income by approximately $9 million in the quarter.", "To provide more-comparable results in our Canada discussions today, as we have done on our previous calls, we will exclude the sales and costs relating to exporting beer to MillerCoors as well as the reporting effects of deconsolidating BRI. ", "So, let\u2019s review some highlights -- our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the calendar quarter ended September 30th decreased 3.2% versus a year ago.  Coors Light continued to show growth, while Molson Export and Molson Canadian declined versus prior year. Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail declined an estimated 0.7% in the calendar third   quarter.  Our estimated Canada market share decreased about one point in the third quarter versus a year ago. Our Canada sales volume was 2.5 million hectoliters in the third quarter, down 1.8% from a year ago. Comparable net sales per hectoliter increased 2% in local currency, driven by favorable net pricing, led by price increases across all major markets, partially offset by continued price discounting activity. ", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter in the third quarter was flat on a comparable basis in local currency.  This increase was due to the net effect of three key factors: first, commodity, packaging material, distribution and other input costs, including pension expense, increased about 1%; second,  an increase of about 2% was driven by fixed cost deleverage related to lower export volume to the U.S. this year; and third, these increases were offset by savings from our Resources for Growth initiatives.", "Comparable marketing general & administrative expense in the quarter increased 4.4% in local currency, driven by higher brand and innovation investments.", "In the U.S., underlying U.S. segment pretax income grew 16.6% to $107.4 million in the third quarter, driven by continued strong underlying earnings growth by MillerCoors.  Strong MillerCoors income growth was partially offset by cycling high equity income last year and one day of income for our legacy Coors business prior to the formation of MillerCoors on July 1, 2008.  The equity income adjustments for our U.S. segment results are described in more detail in our earnings release distributed this morning. ", "Looking specifically at the total MillerCoors P&L, third quarter underlying net income increased 28.1% to $244.4 million from the prior year. MillerCoors is successfully delivering synergies, controlling costs, and managing revenue for sustainable profit growth, despite continuing commodity cost pressures.", "           ", "In a weak U.S. beer market, MillerCoors domestic sales-to-retailers, STRs, were down 1.3% due to a decline in premium light volumes and continued softness in above premium and premium brands.  Domestic sales-to-wholesalers, STWs, fell 0.7%, driven by lower retail sales. Despite the challenging environment, we're realizing the benefit of a well-balanced portfolio that offers consumers choice and variety in all segments.  In the third quarter, during the key summer sales period, MillerCoors had four of the six largest dollar-growth brands in the scanner data.  These brands are MGD 64, Coors Light, Miller High Life and Keystone Light.", "MillerCoors total net sales revenue increased 3.1% to $2.01 billion versus a year ago, driven by domestic net pricing.  Pricing remained strong in the third quarter, as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, excluding contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 3.7%, driven by sustained price increases taken in the fall of 2008 and reductions in discount activity. ", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 3.5% as benefits from synergies and other cost-reduction programs were more than offset by higher brewing and packaging material costs under procurement contracts largely arranged prior to more-recent commodity market price reductions. Marketing, general and administrative costs decreased 4.5%, driven primarily by synergies and other cost savings.", "Moving to our U.K. business in the third quarter, underlying pretax earnings increased more than 20% in local currency from a year ago.  This increase was driven by positive results from the strategic actions our U.K. team has taken in the past year, including leveraging our contract brewing arrangement and brand building efforts, allowing us to forgo low-margin volume. The benefit of these actions was partially offset by the one-time impact of a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges and cycling a one-time supplier negotiation benefit of $6 million in 2008, combined with lower volume and higher marketing, general and administrative expenses in the quarter. ", "In U.S. dollars terms, third quarter U.K. underlying pretax profit increased 6.5% to $32.7 million versus a year ago.  These results include the impact of a 13% devaluation of the British Pound versus the U.S. dollar, which reduced U.K. earnings by $5 million in the quarter. ", "Looking at third quarter highlights, our U.K. owned-brand volume decreased 6.3% in the quarter due to declining industry volume and the company\u2019s strategy to forgo low-margin volume.  U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 1% in the third quarter. Comparable net sales per hectoliter of our own products increased 21% in local currency, driven by two factors: first, 17% was due to higher pricing in all channels, as we benefited from our strategy to forgo low-margin volume; and second, four percentage points were due to positive sales mix, due to growth in draught Magners cider, Cobra, and favorable channel mix. ", "Comparable cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 22% versus 2008 in local currency, driven by the following: 6% was due to cycling the one-time supplier negotiation benefit in 2008; 5% was due to input cost inflation; 4% was driven by growth in draught Magners cider, Cobra, and adverse channel mix; 3% was related to a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges, which is expected to partially reverse in the fourth quarter; and 2% was due to the deleveraging impact of lower owned-brand volumes. ", "Recall also that our contract brewing arrangements effectively take up spare capacity in the production network to deliver sales revenue which contributes positively to the bottom line company performance.  ", "Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 7.8% in local currency due to higher marketing, incentive compensation, and bad-debt expenses in the quarter, along with sales-related costs in our new Cobra business.  ", "In the International Markets and Corporate segment, our International Markets team grew volume nearly 28% in the third quarter off a small base, driven by China and Europe. MG&A expense for International was $12.7 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.1 million versus a year ago. In addition, corporate general & administrative expense increased $7.7 million to $28.1 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, project spending, and labor-related costs this year.  ", "Third quarter net interest expense declined $3.7 million from a year ago, with about 2.7 of this reduction attributable to the deconsolidation of BRI and the balance due to foreign currency movements.  Note that interest expense for the third quarter of 2008 has been increased $4 million retroactively in accordance with the new accounting rules for convertible debt.", "Corporate other income increased $49.1 million, driven by a $59.3 million non-cash mark-to-market gain related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster\u2019s common stock. As usual, these mark-to-market gains on the Foster\u2019s swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.", "The underlying loss for International markets and corporate combined was $57.5 million pretax in the third quarter, 7.1% higher than a year ago.", "Now, highlights of our cost-reduction initiatives -- in the third quarter, we captured an incremental $18 million of cost savings as part of our three-year, $250 million Resources for Growth, or RFG, cost reduction initiative. Savings from the RFG program during the past 2.75 years now total $246 million. ", "In addition to RFG savings, MillerCoors delivered $73 million of incremental cost synergies in the third quarter, largely due to organizational savings.  Our 42% share of these synergies is $31 million. ", "As we announced earlier in the year, we are wrapping up the RFG program and locking down our next generation cost-reduction program, called RFG2.  This new program offers at least $100 million of permanent cost reductions over the next three years.  The primary areas of savings for the new program will be in logistics, waste, utilities, maintenance, systems, and procurement.  We plan to provide more details regarding RFG2 during our annual New York analyst meeting this March.", "Moving beyond operating business unit performance, our third quarter effective tax rate was 9% on a reported basis and 4% on an underlying basis. These rates are well below our long-term rates due to the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions in the third quarter, which was one quarter earlier than we anticipated at the time of our previous earnings call.", "Free cash flow for the first three quarters of 2009 reflected net cash generation of $490 million, which was made up of $667 million of operating cash flow, plus $4 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus capital spending of $72 million and $109 million of investing cash contributed to MillerCoors.  If we exclude one-time cash uses by MillerCoors to capture synergies, along with the return of collateral cash related to MillerCoors commodity hedges, our underlying free cash flow totaled $534 million for the first three quarters of this year.  As a result, we are more than 90% of the way toward our 2009 goal of generating $575 million of underlying free cash flow.", "Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.68 billion. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $565 million at the end of the third quarter, resulting in net debt of $1.11 billion.  ", "Looking forward, we continue to expect full-year 2009 MG&A expense in the Corporate and International Markets segment of approximately $160 million. We now anticipate full-year corporate interest expense in the range of $90 to $95 million at today\u2019s foreign exchange rates, including the net effect of new accounting rules for convertible debt and the deconsolidation of BRI. ", "Turning to our effective tax rate, we now expect our full-year underlying tax rate for 2009 to be close to zero, assuming no further changes in tax laws.  In the fourth quarter this year, we anticipate a significantly negative tax rate due to the resolution of additional tax years.  With the substantial reduction in unrecognized tax positions this year, we anticipate that our effective tax rate after 2009 will be less volatile and more likely to be in our long-term range of 22% to 26% for underlying earnings.", "Based on our year-to-date cash generation, we are confident that we will achieve our goal of generating $575 million of underlying free cash flow this year.  As in the past, this goal excludes the one-time MillerCoors impacts on our cash flow. This goal also excludes the benefit of MillerCoors using less collateral cash for commodity hedges this year. Our total free cash generation for the year will depend significantly on working capital timing in the fourth quarter.", "As we mentioned last quarter, another factor that could affect the company\u2019s free cash flow this year is the potential to resolve some of the contingent liabilities related to our former Brazil business.  During the second quarter, the Brazilian government enacted a tax amnesty that may accelerate the resolution of some of these liabilities, which could result in a use of cash.", " ", "Our 2009 capital spending outlook is now approximately $130 million for the full year.  As usual, this guidance excludes MillerCoors.  ", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the balance of 2009.  Peter.", "", "Peter Swinburn", "Thanks very much, Stewart. Throughout 2009, we have consistently said that we would focus on brand building, reducing costs across our company, and generating cash, and that goes on. ", "In Canada, for the balance of 2009, we expect a continued challenging environment due to overall weak economic conditions, soft beer industry volume, continued price discounting, and the cost of offering enhanced value propositions to consumers. Our commitment to improve the brand portfolio in Canada is now gaining traction.  In the fourth quarter, we are launching Rickard\u2019s Dark, Molson \u201cM,\u201d the first micro-carbonated lager, and Molson Canadian 67, the lowest calorie beer in Canada.  ", "Also, with the 2010 Vancouver Olympics approaching, we will begin to accelerate our promotional activity as the Official Beer Supplier to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. ", "In the U.S., the first priority for MillerCoors is driving growth for our premium light portfolio.  We believe we have the marketing platforms, tools and the beers to do that. First, we are supporting Miller Lite with great football and soon holiday programming. We\u2019re driving its great taste message with the \u201cGreat Calls\u201d campaign celebrating great sports moments, and we\u2019re injecting humor into the message with \u201cLove Your Beer\u201d spots that have just started airing.", "Secondly, we believe the cold refreshment message will continue to drive Coors Light\u2019s success and we\u2019ll continue to innovate and drive distribution and display just to make sure that happens.", "Finally, we\u2019re stepping up display, sampling and education behind MGD 64. ", "In the U.K., we expect performance comparisons with prior year will become more challenging in the fourth quarter as we cycle the ramp up of our strategic initiatives, an extraordinary price increase in the fall of 2008, a greater portion of our sales coming from the higher-cost off-premise channel, and a reduction in marketing spending in 2008.  We also anticipate higher incentive compensation in the fourth quarter this year in the UK.  This business is now on much firmer footing and has made substantial progress in improving profitability.", "Our international business is increasing its investments in a number of new brand and market initiatives, particularly in developing markets.  As a result, we expect MG&A expense to increase significantly in the fourth quarter from a year ago.", "Following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter: in Canada, our comparable sales to retail in the first four weeks of October decreased at a high-single-digit rate, driven by weak economic conditions and poor weather, especially around the Canadian Thanksgiving holiday, leading to a decline in industry volume. ", "In the first five weeks of the fourth quarter, our U.K. sales to retail have decreased at a low-double-digit rate.", "In the U.S. for the first four weeks of the fourth quarter, MillerCoors sales to retail declined at a mid-single-digit rate due to overall industry softness.", "As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a very small portion of the fourth quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "In the area of cost outlook, by business: in Canada, on a comparable basis, excluding exports and BRI deconsolidation impacts, we now anticipate that cost of goods sold per hectoliter will decrease at a low-single-digit rate in the fourth quarter of 2009, due to benefits from our RFG cost savings program and lower overhead costs, which we expect to more than offset input inflation and ongoing product mix shifts.  ", "On a reported basis, we expect our Canada cost of goods per hectoliter in the fourth quarter to decrease at a high-single-digit rate in local currency, due to lower exports to the U.S. and the effect of deconsolidating BRI this year. ", "Our U.K. team is targeting more reductions as part of the Resources for Growth program, driven by supplier negotiations and operational efficiencies. In a challenging industry volume environment, we expect our fourth quarter 2009 U.K. cost of goods per hectoliter to increase at a double-digit rate in local currency. Drivers include an increase in the high-cost off-premise channel as a percent of our mix, continued input cost inflation, product mix reflecting more Cobra and draught Magners volume, and fixed-cost de-leverage as a result of lower owned-brand volumes this year.", " ", "In the U.S., MillerCoors has delivered $183 million in synergies to date this year, bringing the total to $211 million since beginning operations on July 1, 2008.  The U.S. team now expects to achieve $270 million of cumulative synergies by the end of 2009, surpassing its original commitment of $225 million.  ", "As we\u2019ve previously mentioned, MillerCoors plans to deliver incremental cost savings above its $500 million synergy target, and approximately $200 million of additional cost savings are now expected to be delivered by the end of 2012.  These additional cost savings include efficiencies in production costs, procurement, and MG&A expenses.      ", "So, to summarize our discussions today, our third quarter results included significant non-operating and unusual noise in the numbers.  Regardless, Molson Coors grew earnings at a double-digit rate in the quarter.   ", "Looking at year-to-date performance for Molson Coors Brewing Company, the first three quarters of 2009 have been positive in terms of both financial results and progress in our businesses.  Highlights include: total company underlying earnings up more than 33% year to date; in Canada, the new members of the leadership team, led by CEO Dave Perkins, is improving our competitive position. They have begun to roll out several portfolio-building innovations, and announced their intention to purchase Granville Island Brewing in British Columbia; our U.K. business has posted strong financial results year to date, with underlying pretax income up more than 75% in local currency.  The team is leveraging strategic initiatives to improve financial performance and now has finalized contracts with all its major on-premise chain customers, which offers a solid platform to drive both volume and margin in the years ahead; in the U.S., MillerCoors is delivering on its synergies commitments, controlling costs and managing revenue for sustainable profit growth.  In a challenging economic environment, MillerCoors is also realizing the benefits of a well-balanced portfolio, as evidenced by our out-performance versus the category this summer.  ", "Molson Coors achieved good performance year-to-date, and as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we anticipate that global beer markets will remain soft and consumers will continue to look for value in a weak economy. ", "To drive volume, price and profit, we will continue to offer value to consumers in many forms, including innovative brands and packaging, as well as category-leading advertising, retail promotions, and service to our customers. In the fourth quarter, there will be incremental investments related to these efforts, and these will be most significant in our Canada, U.S. and international businesses.", "In Canada, we are introducing three innovative brands -- Molson M, Molson Canadian 67 and Rickard\u2019s Dark, and accelerating our promotional activity as the official beer supplier to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. And in the fourth quarter, we are also rolling out new advertising creative for the Molson Canadian brand.", "In the U.S., we are increasing our investment behind the fast-growing MGD64 and other brands, as well as expanding distribution of our innovative home draft package.  Also, our latest Miller Lite advertising, which is hitting the air waves now, has received positive reviews from distributors and in consumer research.", "International growth is a key part of our strategy going forward, and we are investing more behind our strategic brands in select markets in Asia and Europe. ", "These fourth quarter investments are consistent with our brand-led strategies, and we expect them to drive top-line and bottom-line growth as we move into 2010. Equally important, our innovation pipeline is full for 2010, with a wide range of opportunities to build brands and drive profitable growth in each of our businesses well into the future.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment -- our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon.  Also, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, our Investor Relations team led by Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results.  That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "So at this point, Matthew, we would like to open it for questions, please. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Stewart, on the free cash flow, your 90% of the way but you still have a quarter left. Could you give us a read on what we should be thinking about or if there is any reason why you haven\u2019t taken up the free cash flow target for the year?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Good question, Kaumil. We\u2019re not going to give any guidance on where we are going to end up in the -- at the end of the year. That will come a little closer to the fourth quarter but I think really just step back and just say this is really a positive for us, given where we started the year and we set our targets, our earnings have come in stronger, and the business is performing better than we had expected. And that is showing through to our cash and that\u2019s just got to be good news for the shareholders. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Okay but there is nothing incremental in terms of uses of cash, maybe the increment CapEx related to the new cost savings at MillerCoors -- is there anything like that in there?", "Stewart Glendinning", "No, I think we -- all of that we\u2019ve shared with you. MillerCoors is at 84% of the one-time cash, the 450. They will be at 90 by the end of the year, so there is that piece. ", "The other piece we look at is our exposure in Brazil and as we updated you last quarter, we are still in some discussions with [DEMSA] to decide how that will be resolved but that is a potential use of cash and I\u2019d use -- I\u2019d go to our Q and you\u2019ll see we\u2019ve got about $160 million of liability on the books. That\u2019s not all related to those specific -- to that specific item. I\u2019d say probably in the sort of 85% to 90% is the number on our balance sheet related to that and that\u2019s the best guide for that particular issue. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Okay, got it. And then last question, in every region, pricing was very -- or net revenue per hec was strong but volumes were weak. How comfortable do you feel in your ability to hold on to strong pricing?", "Peter Swinburn", "A couple of things I think we mentioned in the script -- first of all in the U.K., we\u2019ve locked out negotiations with all the major pub-cos this year, so that gives us -- those deals are three-year deals at least, so the pricing is -- the price increase mechanisms are locked in for those and that would account roughly for about a third of our business in the U.K., so we feel comfortable in the U.K. ", "If you were listening to the MillerCoors call earlier this morning, I think that both Leo and Gavin talked about where the MillerCoors business was. They\u2019ve got about 80% of their pricing through this year, cost of goods look a bit more reasonable going forward so again, I think we are relatively comfortable in the U.S. ", "And in Canada, it\u2019s a slightly different perspective, to be honest with you. I think we\u2019ve shared with you that we will be competitive in Canada. The team there is really getting its act together but we manage pricing by market, by SKU there and across the piece, to be honest with you, to ensure that we are competitive. So I think that\u2019s the best summary I can give you, if that\u2019s helpful. ", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "I guess my question is really by looking at Canada more closely, you know, your share decline has gotten worse in the quarter. Maybe you can shed a little bit more light into sort of the competitive activity in terms of what is going on there. It sounded like in the beginning of the year, really the discounting was more limited to Quebec and I\u2019m wondering if that is spreading out into other regions. What\u2019s causing sort of the heightened competitive environment and at what point do you think that you may have to take more aggressive steps just beyond some of the innovation things that you are doing to really stem the market share losses in that market?", "Peter Swinburn", "I\u2019ll pass the main body of the question on to Dave but I think that you hit one of the main points again, Judy, and that is that we see the market being managed in totality and we have been pretty open in the past saying that we weren\u2019t happy with our overall portfolio in Canada and we believe we are making very good steps, great strides, in fact, to sorting that out with the innovations that we\u2019ve got coming into the market place and the new creative with Canadian, which we are very excited about. But Dave, do you want to address the main body of the question?", "Dave Perkins", "Thanks, Peter, and thanks, Judy, for the question. Judy, as I look at Q3 and our year-to-date share results, obviously we are not where we need to be. I think it\u2019s valuable to go a little bit below the surface in looking at our Q3 share results. We did actually make progress in our competitiveness and our share results in our major markets of Quebec and Ontario and I feel good about what I am seeing starting to happen there as we get to a better balance of price and volume. We are dealing with challenges and opportunities in the remainder of the country. ", "I think as we went through the quarter, we also saw some progress which felt good to me. But no question we saw smaller regional brewers in each market grow share at the expense of the two major brewers combined and that is something that we will continue to be focused on. ", "As we have heard, we are really taking action now to strengthen our market position and our brand portfolio in a variety of ways. We feel very good about the innovation that we have coming up with Molson Canadian 67, Molson M, and Rickard\u2019s Dark. I think the announcement regarding Granville Island Brewing is another commitment to strengthening the portfolio, and particularly in the above premium segment there, so that\u2019s a well-known, well-regarded brand in B.C. that we think has the ability to travel and we are excited by that. ", "We also have work underway to strengthen Molson Canadian, as Peter referenced, and we have the upcoming Olympic platform, and we will certainly leverage that fully. ", "And finally, as we noted, we continue to improve our competitive position and finding that right balance between price and volume. ", "So I would say as you go below the surface in the quarter, there are some encouraging signs. Certainly the entire team here is focused on the share challenge because we know we need to step into that and feel good about the activity in fact that we have in front of us there. ", "", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Just following up on your comment about the smaller regional brewers getting more competitive outside of Quebec and Ontario, can you maybe tell us what sort of are the factors that are driving that competitive behavior in those markets?", "Dave Perkins", "A lot of it is in fact price or value related. I would say though that during Q3 there was in fact some innovation activity, lime entries, that in fact did get fairly high trial. They have subsequently diminished but they did get high trial. But generally what we are seeing is small brewer pricing activity that we are needing to deal with. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then just a clarification -- when you said the Canada SPR was down high single digits so far in the quarter, can you tell us what the industry volume has been during that time?", "Dave Perkins", "We believe what we are seeing in October is largely related to industry. There does appear to be during October a fairly significant drop-off in industry. Last year I would tell you that we had particularly favorable weather and so we believe that that\u2019s a factor in it. Tough to know what all the factors are -- I mean, there\u2019s even impact in Canada related to the flu going around, so you look at the various factors and there\u2019s probably a combination  of weather, economy, and other factors that are at play. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thanks. And then just my question for Stewart -- on the free cash flow side of the equation, I mean, clearly it sounds like you are pretty pleased with the cash flow generation performance and even if you are to use a portion of that to settle some of the tax liabilities in Brazil, it seems like you are going to be left with still a pretty ample cash flow. And so I\u2019m just wondering why not again sort of commit to some of that going to shareholders at this point?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Great question, Judy. We are in a place I guess where if you looked at our cash holding, the cash balance at the end of this quarter, about $575 million, so we are in a place now where we feel good about our cash balance. ", "I will reiterate the point we made in previous quarters, which is that on a quarterly basis, we review this with our board and there\u2019s a range of cash options that we could look to. If you looked at some of the places we have put cash this year, we\u2019ve made two great purchases of smaller brands this year -- well, we haven\u2019t completed the purchase of Granville Island but we\u2019ve made effectively a down payment on that. We also have purchased Cobra, so we are trying to use cash first and foremost in ways that will grow shareholder value. We will also look then at ways to take liabilities off our balance sheet and tax would be an example of that. Last year you saw a use of funds for pensions, and then we will look at what our dividend policy is and consider buy-backs. And again, we have our board meeting next week so we will go through that with the board and if there is any change to any of that, we expect to update shareholders in the next quarter. ", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Marc Greenberg of Deutsche Bank.", "Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Just to dig a little deeper on Judy\u2019s question around shareholder value, Peter, can you comment more broadly with regard to what kind of a dividend pay-out over the long-term you think is appropriate for a business like Molson Coors and if shareholders would be more significantly enhanced by a repurchase and as an adjunct to that, what kinds of net debt to EBITDA levels are gearing this kind of business should have over the longer term?", "Peter Swinburn", "Thanks, Marc -- I\u2019m probably going to disappoint you by saying that no, I probably can\u2019t give you all of that but I think you\u2019ve got to look at our track record. We\u2019ve increased our dividend by a pretty substantial rate last year and this year and so I think the important thing, or the way that we look at it is that we need to come to our shareholders and hold our heads up in terms of how we use their cash and I think as Stewart said, in the recent -- in the last 12 months, we put $100 million into the pension scheme in the U.K. We have got very, very good returns from that investment over this year. We have made a couple of really smart acquisitions I think with Cobra and Granville Island. Although you guys get quite excited about it, we are not sitting on a ton of cash. We are in a comfortable position and we will continue to look at the options out there that will give us the best possible return for shareholders and that will include dividends, obviously, it will include share backs, but it would include other options in terms of strengthening our balance sheets as well and that\u2019s just an ongoing dialog that we have with our board, as Stewart said. ", "Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Great, and just a quick follow-up -- on the U.K. business, nice to see the operating profit trending up but it is still, at least based on your 2002 pro formas, below what CBL earned eight years ago, so I guess it\u2019s been kind of a long road there and I\u2019m wondering, as you look at that business today, what kind of sign posts you look at to gauge the success of that business, how might we properly characterize progress there sort of beyond the obvious metrics?", "Peter Swinburn", "I will let  Mark take most of the question but I think my -- the initial response is that you have put a couple of sort of sign posts out there that we look at and most importantly, the sort of cost of -- return on capital we get on that business has got to be acceptable to shareholders. I think we have made good progress this year. We are not where we want to be. The percentage that we achieve in -- our net sales percentage we are achieving is still not where we want to be but again, I think the team is making really good strides in that direction and most importantly for this year and probably last year as well, it\u2019s been about developing a platform that allows us to address those issues. And I think, Mark, you can probably speak to that more effectively than I can in terms of the strategic initiatives and your pricing strategy. ", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, I certainly can. Thanks for the question, Mark. We\u2019ve been very clear in our business that currently our return on invested capital is below our [WAC] rate and we have set out as part of our three-year plan an ambition to move that return on invested capital ahead of our [WAC] rate, so we start growing shareholder value. Our return on sales have improved significantly over the last 18 to 24 months and we have set a very clear ambition for the business to start to generate returns which get us back to where we were in the early part of the 2000s. ", "All of the activities that you are seeing taking place through the latter half of 2008 and through 2009 are very consistent with that ambition and job number one has been to reset our pricing and ensure that our net sales [have always starts to] support those ambitions. That job is almost complete as we go through 2009. We\u2019ve continued to invest heavily behind our brands. We\u2019ve been investing a growth rate which is a low double-digit on a per hectoliter basis as we\u2019ve moved our pricing up. And as we move into 2010, we expect to see pricing continue to move forward and we expect to see our share performance start to rebound, having reset pricing -- all of that relative to an ambition that we\u2019ve set for the organization on a 36-month timeline. ", "Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Mark, just briefly, how would you characterize the market environment heading into the important winter holidays?", "Mark Hunter", "The market environment remains challenging. If you look at where industry volume was as we left 2008, the market finished down about 5.5%. On a year-to-date basis, the market is still tracking down about 4.3%. On-trade has improved but it is still declining at kind of mid-single-digits. Off-trade has been extremely volatile -- up until Q3 of this year, we\u2019ve seen four straight quarters of pretty substantial decline. That rebounded slightly in the third quarter, so still enormous volatility and certainly no tailwinds from an industry volume perspective and that is why our focus on not chasing any low margin volume, focusing on revenue growth at a time when we\u2019ve got very high asset utilization because of our contract brewing deal -- all of that I think puts us in a pretty strong position as we move into Q4 and into 2010. ", "Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from J.P. Morgan.", "John Faucher - J.P. Morgan", "I want to talk a little bit about the Canadian pricing again and you know, strong revenue per barrel growth -- can you talk about what the industry revenue per barrel growth was? So how did you guys compare? ", "And then also, looking at the quarter to date trends, you talked about your being down I think it was mid-single-digits in Canada and can you compare that -- you said it\u2019s an industry issue, so I am assuming the industry is basically in line with your quarter to date trend, is that correct?", "Dave Perkins", "Yeah, the quarter to date would be largely industry related, so you are correct on that. With regard to the NSR for the industry, I wouldn\u2019t have data on that. I only obviously have ours, so I am not able to give you the comparison. ", "John Faucher - J.P. Morgan", "Can you give us a rough idea in terms whether you think the rest of the category is -- I\u2019m not looking specifically, I\u2019m looking sort of general trends in terms of whether you feel like the rest of the category is up a similar amount. ", "Dave Perkins", "Well, we certainly are achieving the kind of balance we want on price and volume so I would say we are not dramatically out of line with what would be happening within the industry but it is really difficult obviously to get more precise than that. ", "John Faucher - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Canada, on the cost side of things, Stewart or David, we heard from MillerCoors this morning, they described their costs per hectoliter view for the U.S. next year being essentially flat on \u201909 levels. Can you share with us, given where your hedges are and where the commodities are and your mix, how you think your costs per hectoliter will shake out next year versus this year\u2019s levels?", "Stewart Glendinning", "I\u2019ll take that. I think MillerCoors did give some of that sense of 2010. For the Molson Coors business, normally we would give that kind of guidance early in the next year and I think that is what our plan is. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Can you give us any directional feel at this juncture?", "Stewart Glendinning", "We can't give you any guidance on that. I can say though that I think that team has done a terrific job in terms of managing costs. If you looked at this past quarter, keeping costs flat on a year-over-year basis I think was a great result. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "And can you just remind us about your strategy in terms of hedging for commodities?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Well for us, like any hedging program, and you can certainly see some of those disclosures in our Q. We have a declining hedging balance so you will have more hedging in the early periods than the later periods and then so obviously in any kind of rising price market, you\u2019d be slower to see some of that rising prices coming through. In a declining price market, you will obviously be a little bit slower to see some of that benefit coming through.", "I should also point out, Mark, that we did at least give guidance for the fourth quarter, which shows Canada to be down low single digits in terms of their COGS, so combine that together with the performance in the third quarter and I think you probably get a good answer for next year. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Great. Thank you, Stewart. ", "Operator", "", "And our final question in queue comes from Ross Turner of [Pelham]. ", "Ross Turner - Pelham Capital ", "It\u2019s [inaudible] from Pelham Capital. Just looking at the Canadian business, you obviously reported 2% increase in revenue per hectoliter, but if you actually look at your revenue and divide it by your volume, it actually was a decline. I\u2019m guessing that is due to the import side of the Canadian business. Can you give us some feel about how the mix effect that you have seen in the Canada business from your import and how much that should decline specifically?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Let me just pick up the first part of that -- you are better off looking at some of the comparable numbers that we have given you because there is a little bit of noise in there as we look at the impact obviously of FX -- that\u2019s going to be one impact. I think the other impact you are going to see is the Molson -- sorry, the Blue Moon that we stopped producing in Canada has a negative impact on a reported basis on our NSR of about 3%. So we stopped producing Blue Moon last year in Canada. We have that year-over-year comparison issue, so best to really stick with the comparison -- ", "Ross Turner - Pelham Capital ", "What I am looking at -- the way I\u2019ve looked at it, to be honest, and also a [few other things in Canada], is actually look at your Q2 sales this year and your Q3 sales and divide that by your volume for Q2 and Q3. Now I know there\u2019s seasonal effects, I\u2019m sure, but even then just looking at those three months sequentially, it\u2019s down sort of 3% or 4% in Canadian dollars per hectoliter. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "I think one of the things you are going to see there is potentially the impact of exports and I think that was the second part of your question, which perhaps Dave can pick up. ", "Dave Perkins", "I\u2019m sorry, Stewart, we didn\u2019t hear the original question. ", "Ross Turner - Pelham Capital ", "The question was basically that obviously you said that on a comparable basis, sales per hectoliter in Canada increased 2%. Looking at it sequentially from Q2 to Q3 09, if you look at revenue per hectoliter on the Canadian dollar, it actually declines sort of 3% or 4%. And I am guessing that\u2019s to do with imports, because you exclude imports when you are looking at it on a comparable basis. I\u2019m just trying to understand how much were your imports down and what sort of effect this is going to have going forward. ", "Dave Dunnewald", "The answer to the question is essentially you had a flip of the impact that Stewart mentioned related to exports to MillerCoors. In the second quarter, the -- essentially the accounting for those exports increased revenue per hectoliter as well as cost of goods per hectoliter. In the third quarter again on a year over year basis, the exports to MillerCoors reduced the revenue per hectoliter and the cost of goods per hectoliter and that is why when we present comparable analysis of our Canadian results, we strip those out because it\u2019s basically just noise in the numbers, change in the way we account for the beer that we sell to MillerCoors. Now, subsequent to the formation of MillerCoors and subsequent to the moving of Blue Moon product production from Canada to the U.S. ", "Ross Turner - Pelham Capital ", "Okay -- going forward, this should be -- this sort of noise won't -- is less likely to be there? ", "Dave Dunnewald", "Actually in the fourth quarter, you should see a similar effect to what we saw in the third quarter and then more normal thereafter. ", "Ross Turner - Pelham Capital ", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. I have no other questions in queue. I would like to return the program to the presenters for any concluding remarks. ", "Peter Swinburn", "Thank you very much, Matthew and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning, this afternoon and for your interest in the business. We look forward to speaking to you again at the end of our next quarter. Bye now. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference.

Along with some initial perspectives on 2010, and then as usual we will open the call for questions. ", "So, we will get started. Underlying earnings for our company increased more than 85% in the fourth quarter versus the year ago driven by one time reduction in tax rate. Behind the headline number, our results were affected by weak volumes across all markets. ", "Cost increase in the U.S. and UK and brand investments in Canada.

", "Our forums in the quarter and over the past year has benefited from this strategic focus. While our underlying earnings in the fourth quarter were aided by one time reduction in our tax rate, it\u2019s important to point out that we grew or held our net pricing and market share in both the U.S. and Canada. ", "Our Canada share performance represented a significant trend improvement in previous quarters. In the UK we continue to forgo low profit volume and share which helps us drive positive pricing and margins. For the full year, we expanded our brand portfolios in Canada and the UK, exceeded our goals for cost savings and maintain price discipline all of which contributed to a significant increase in our full year underlying earnings. Looking at the regional headlines for the fourth quarter our Canada team launched three new products and new (Audio Gap).", "Operator", "", "Your line is now reconnected sir.", "", "Peter Swinburn", "Okay, well my apologies everybody, I am not quite sure what happened there and I don\u2019t know how much everybody.

Our Canada share performance represented a significant trend improvement from previous quarters. ", "In the UK we continued to forego low profit volume and share which helps us drive positive pricing and margins. For the full year we expanded our brand portfolios in Canada and the UK exceeded our goals for cost savings and maintained price discipline all of which contributed to a significant increase in our full year underlying earnings.", "Looking at the regional headlines for the fourth quarter our Canada team launched 3 new products and new ad created for Molson Canadian. As well as accelerating promotional activity behind our sponsorship of the Vancouver Winter Olympics. ", "These brand investments and the addition of Granville Island volume helps us to increase some market share a quarter of one point versus a year ago. Our share performance in the fourth quarter was particularly encouraging in the eastern provinces which represent nearly three quarters of our Canada volume. ", "A weak economy and industry along with the cost of these new brand investments resulted in a 5% decline in underlying Canada earnings in the quarter. But our brand work is beginning to give us the platform we require to improve share and revenue performance in Canada going forward.", "In the U.S. MillerCoors fourth quarter results reflect a significantly weaker beer industry than expected. Consumer's reduced overall volume of beer purchases and favored value over convenience in their choices as a result all major channels are worsening of sales trends in the fourth quarter versus earlier in 2009 in line with our overall strategy, our U.S. team continued to invest heavily in brands and maintain market share in a declining industry. In fact five out of six of our U.S. focus brands grew share in the fourth quarter.", "Nonetheless lower volume and adverse sales mix have a substantial negative impact on our U.S. financial results in the quarter with segment income declining nearly 9% from year ago despite delivery of cost synergies.", "Our UK team achieved another strong performance in the fourth quarter with 20% growth in underlying earnings driven by continued price management and solid brand building performance was particularly encouraging and the independent on premise channel and with the Cobra brand which we acquired in 2009.", "The results in the UK show what can be achieved with high equity brands such as Carling now Stewart will take you through the details but we are pleased with the progress of our businesses and the progress being made in building brands managing price reducing cost generating cash and becoming a stronger competitor in each of markets. Before we discuss the fourth quarter in detail I want to share with you some important accomplishments for 2009.", "For the full year we continue to make great strides in our brands, our competitive position cost reductions and cash generation but we gave back a lot so we can just see volume unfavorable currency movements and commodity inflation particularly in the U.S. and the UK. ", "Globally we reported underlying earnings of $707.4 million up 40.7% from a year ago on earnings per share increased $1.10 per share to $3.81 per share. Positive results were driven by a lower effective tax rate price discipline and cost reductions.", "Free cash flow for 2009 reflected net cash generation of $691 million which was made up of $824 million of operating cash flow plus $58 million of proceeds from asset sales minus capital spending of $125 million and $66 million of investing cash contributed to MillerCoors.

", "As a result, we exceeded our 2009 underlining free cash flow goal which was $575 million by nearly 27%. We exceeded all of our cost reduction goals and announced our next generation of cost reduction called RFT 2 which plans to capture at least another $100 million of annualized cost savings over the next three years. ", "Also MillerCoors delivered $245 million of the $500 million synergy reduction in 2009. Additionally, MillerCoors delivered $26 million of its $200 million of next generation cost savings in 2009 and we of course benefit from 42% of these MillerCoors cost savings. ", "In Canada the leadership team led by CEO Dave Perkins is accelerating our strategy of brand development and innovation. Later in the year we introduced the first new Molson trademark brand for five years called MolsonM. ", "Along with a low calorie extension of Molson Canadian and the introduction of Rickard's Dark, these introductions are exceeding our expectations and have contributed to our share performance. ", "We also strengthened our Canada asset weight by selling out interest in the Montreal Canadiens Hockey Club and agreeing to buy Granville Island Brewing Company. The Granville Island acquisition we expect to close in the first half of 2010 further increases our presence in the highly profitable upper premium segment. ", "MillerCoors exceeded its synergy targets and announced another $200 million of cost saving reductions to be delivered by the end of the 2012. The U.S. team also invested heavily in building brands and sales capabilities. Despite the toughest U.S. beer market in decades, MillerCoors grew underlying income by more than 18% and greatly increased its cash generation in 2009. ", "MillerCoors was formed a year and a half ago to make as a stronger competitor and improve our financial performance in the U.S. and this team is delivering on that promise. ", "In the UK we drove volume on the back of the Carling brand strength delivered solid course like growth, purchase to controlling interest in the Global brand grew Magners Draught Cider and completed the ramp up of our contract brewing arrangements. We leveraged these strategic initiatives to balance price and volume priorities affectively.", "Additionally we closed our defined benefit pension scheme to all future accrual of time and benefits which will reduce the growth of these liabilities in the future. Our international teams enhanced its capabilities and continue to invest in developing markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America. ", "Due to our focus on cash generation to strengthen our balance sheet our cost savings success and on increased investment in brands in innovation, we entered 2010 a stronger more competitive company, than we were a year ago. ", "We will continue to build a strong a portfolio brand so that we were able to deliver share and revenue growth to go with our cost savings successes.", "So with that as an overview I will turn over to Stewart to review fourth quarter financial results and trends. And then we will cover the outlook for 2010, so Stewart over to you.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Thanks Peter. Hello everyone now I will start with the fourth quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 4% from a year ago, driven by overall industry weakness as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K. ", "On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $190.3 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, was 85.5% higher than the fourth quarter a year ago driven by the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions and the year-over-year currency moments.", "Underlying pre-tax income declined 6% due to weak industry conditions in the U.S. and Canada along with cost inflation in the U.S. and UK.", "It is important to note that our fourth quarter underlying earnings exclude some one-time gains and losses and expenses, primarily related to the sale of our 19.9% interest in the Montreal, Canadians hockey team. ", "Changes in the value of our Foster\u2019s cash-settled total-return swap and income tax rate change Ontario and MillerCoors integration costs, as well as net special charges of $11.1 million. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning.  Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. Dollars.", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income and local currency decreased 12% in the fourth quarter from a year ago excluding the impact of foreign currency hedges in other income. Lower production cost in the quarter were more than offset by increases in brand investments higher incentive compensation expense and the impact of deconsolidating our interest in the beer stores in Ontario, known as BRI Brewers Retail Inc. beginning in the first quarter of 2009 based on the strength of our brand investments and innovations we grew market share while maintaining net pricing versus the prior year. ", "In U.S. dollars Canada underlying earnings of $94.5 million in the fourth quarter decreased 5.3% which reflects the benefit of 15% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar. The stronger Canadian dollar this year increased Canada segment underlying income by approximately $11 million in the quarter. ", "To provide more comparable results in our Canada discussions today, as we have done on our previous earnings call. We will exclude the sales and cost related to exporting beer to Campo La Cruz as well as the reporting effects of deconsolidating BRI. ", "So let\u2019s review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended December 31 decreased 1.2% versus the year ago. Coors Light continued to show growth and our new product launches are exceeding expectations. ", "The Molson Canadian Dry and export brands decline various prior year. Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail decline and estimates of 1.9% in the calendar fourth quarter. As a result, our estimated Canada market share increased about one quarter of share point in the fourth quarter versus the year ago driven by our portfolio building innovations and investments that our team rolled out last fall. ", "In the fourth quarter, our market share performance was strongest in Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, especially later in the quarter as our brand building initiatives gained momentum. ", "Our Canada sales volume was $2.1 million hectare liter in the fourth quarter unchanged from a year ago. Comparable net sales per hectare liter were virtually unchanged in local currency various the year ago as favorable frontline pricing was offset by continued price discounting activity. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter in the fourth quarter decreased approximately 3% on a comparable basis in local currency, driven by the net affect of three factors.", "First, the decrease of about 1.5% was due to declines in commodity and packaging material input costs, partially offset by increases in distribution and pension costs. Second, savings from our sources for growth initiatives reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by about 3% and third, these decreases were offset by about 1.5% due to ongoing product mix shifts.", "Comparable marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 14.2% in local currency driven by higher brand investments as well as an increase in incentive compensation expense. Underlying other income decreased $8 million in the fourth quarter due to lower Montreal Canadian's equity income this year along with cycling prior year gains from foreign currency hedges. Note that this underlying result excludes a one time $46 million gain on the sale of our interest in the Canadian's hockey club in the fourth quarter.", "Moving to our U.S. segment, underlying pre-tax income declined 8.9% to $51.2 million in the fourth quarter as weak U.S. beer industry conditions drove lower volumes and significant cost de-leverage in our business. These negative factors were partly offset by favorable pricing, synergies delivery and reductions in marketing, general & administrative costs in the fourth quarter.", "Looking at the total MillerCoors P&L, fourth quarter underlying net income decreased 21.6% to a $106.1 million versus a year earlier. The difference in trend between MillerCoors income and our U.S. segment income is due to a $17 million increase in share base compensation expense for MillerCoors in the fourth quarter of 2009 which was driven by strong appreciation in the SAP Miller stock price versus a year ago. Note that this expense is attributable to higher mark to market values for stock based grants existing prior to the formation of MillerCoors and not the issuance of new grants. Share based compensation expense related to SAP Miller stock price is excluded from our U.S. equity income.", "MillerCoors' domestic sales to retailers STRs declined 3.6% primarily due to poor industry and economic conditions. In a weak industry our U.S. business held market share in the quarter. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers, STWs declined 4.2%, driven by lower STRs and a reduction in contract brewing volumes. MillerCoors total net revenue decreased 1.6% to $1.71 billion versus the prior year.", "Pricing remained strong in the fourth quarter as domestic net revenue per hectoliter which excludes contract brewing and company undistributed sales increased 2.3%. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 5.6% versus the prior year as savings from MillerCoors cost performance initiatives were more than offset by significant increases in brewing and packaging material cost including gloss and aluminum along with volume related cost deleverage. Marketing, general and administrative costs decreased 2.7%, driven primarily by synergies and other cost savings. This decreased would have been about 6% excluding the impact of increased share based compensation expense. Higher information technology cost also had an impact.", "Moving to our U.K. business in the fourth quarter, underlying pre-tax earnings increased nearly 15% in local currency from a year ago. This strong performance was driven by positive results from strategic actions of our U.K. team that they have taken in the past year including leveraging our contract brewing arrangement and brand building efforts which allowed us to forego low margin volume.", "These earnings drivers were partially offset by lower volume and higher incentive compensation expense in the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, fourth quarter U.K. underlying pre-tax profit increased 20.3% to $36.8 million versus a year ago. These results include the benefit of a 4% increase in the valuation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar which increased U.K. earnings by approximately $2 million in the quarter.", "Looking at fourth quarter highlights, our U.K owned brand volume decreased 9.3% in the quarter due to declining industry volume and a company strategy to forego low margin volume. U.K. brewer industry volume declined approximately 4% in the fourth quarter. Comparable net sales per hectoliter of our own products increased 18% in local currency driven by two factors. First, 10% was due to higher pricing at all channels as we benefited from our strategy to forego low margin volume. And second, 8 percentage points were due to positive sales mix predominately due to growth in draught Magners cider and Cobra.", "Comparable cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 12% versus 2008 in local currency predominately driven by the following. 5% was due to input cost inflation with increases in can metal barley, bottles and utilities. 5% was mix driven by growth and draught Magners cider and Cobra. 3% was due to cost deleveraging impact of lower earned brand volumes.", "These factors are partially offset by a 1% cost reduction related to a mark-to-market adjustment on natural gas hedges which partially reverses a charge in the third quarter. Marketing, general and administrative expense in the U.K. increased 11% in local currency due to higher incentive compensation and investments in information systems along with a cost of adding the Cobra sales force this year.", "In the international and corporate segment, the underlying loss for international markets and corporate combined was $58.1 million pre tax in the fourth quarter, 7% higher than a year ago. Our international team grew volume more than 14% in the fourth quarter of a small base driven by sales in China, Europe and Latin America. MG&A expense for international was $15.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $5.5 million versus a year-ago as we increased investments in our priority international markets. In addition corporate general and administrative expense increased $2.5 million to $25.7 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense.", "Fourth quarter corporate net interest expense increased $2 million from a year-ago with about $3.6 million of this increase attributable to foreign currency movements partially offset by approximately $2.3 million related to the deconsolidation of BRI. Note that interest expense for the fourth quarter of 2008 has been increased by $4 million retroactively in accordance with the new accounting rules for convertible debt. Corporate other expense increased $3.3 million driven by a non-cash mark-to-market loss related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to fastest common stock. As usual mark-to-market gains and losses on the fastest swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.", "Now highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. In the fourth quarter we captured an incremental $24 million of cost savings as part of our three year $250 million Resources for Growth, or RFG cost reduction initiative. For full year 2009 we achieved $92 million of savings. As a result we closed out our three year RFG program with a total of $270 million in permanent cost reductions which significantly exceeds our original commitment of $250 million for the program.", "In addition to our RFG savings, MillerCoors delivered $62 million of incremental cost synergies in the fourth quarter., MillerCoors also delivered $26 million of cost reductions against its new $200 million cost savings program to be delivered by end of 2012. These new cost initiatives are additional to the original $500 million three year synergy commitment. As with MillerCoors 42% of these new cost savings accrue to Molson Coors.", "Moving beyond operating business unit performance, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was negative 65% on a reported basis and negative 54% on an underlying basis. These tax rates are well below our long-term rates due to the favorable resolution of unrecognized tax positions in the fourth quarter. Total debts at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.71 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $734 million resulting in net debt of 0.98 billion.", "Looking forward, we expect full-year 2010 MG&A expense in the Corporate and International Markets segment of approximately $180 million plus or minus 5%. We anticipate full-year 2010 corporate interest expense to be approximately a $105 million at today's foreign exchange rates.", "Turning to our effective tax rate we expect our full year underlying tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax laws. We continue to expect our normalized long term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26% after this year. Our 2010 capital spending outlook is approximately a $150 million for the full year. As usual this guidance excludes MillerCoors. At this point, I will turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to 2010. Peter?", "Peter Swinburn", "Thanks, Stewart. In 2010 we will continue to focus on brand building, reducing costs and generating cash. In Canada, we begun to implement against our commitment to include the brand portfolio with the launches of Rickards Dark, Molson M and Molson Canadian 67, a low calorie option for consumers and we have seen favorable volume strength in the later of the fourth quarter as a result. This focus is continued into 2010 with the first quarter launch of Keystone Light and Keystone Lager into the Ontario and Western regions as well as a redesign of our common packaging to reflect the visual appeal of the biggest beer brand in the U.K. Both of these portfolio enhancements leveraged our global brand set and are designed to strengthen our value offerings in the Canada regions where we have faced significant challenges specifically from the smaller brewers who have been the market share beneficiaries for the past several years.", "For the U.S. we are investing behind our brands which we demonstrated late last year with our stepped up advertising for MGD 64 and national TV advertising for Blue Moon. We believe that we have the right positioning for our brands and we are investing aggressively in big ideas, in marketing and innovation to bring them to life. You will see it in this spring with the Miller Lite and Coors Light as we grow with our toned draughts. You will see it as we expand distribution of the Miller Light aluminum pint and later this year introduce Coors Light aluminum pint.", "We also plan to roll our Blue Moon variety packs and introduce a new advertising campaign for Keystone Light and to start a big push for Miller High Life Light. Finally you will see stepped up investment behind MGD 64 as we prepare for some new competition in the ultra light beer market. In the U.K the business is now on much firmer footing and has made substantial progress in improving profitability. During 2010, we expect incremental benefits to accrue from our Cobra brand which we will began brewing during the year.", "We're also in the process of implementing a new enterprise information system in the fall of 2010 and I'll be expecting moderate implementation cost in the near term. This system will help drive efficiency in future years. You will recall that we closed our U.K. defined benefit pension plan in April 2009 with a view to minimizing future risk and exposure.", "Despite a recent improvement in the global economic outlook, pension related interest rates have fallen to historical lows and equity values remain below peak levels of two years ago. As we result we expect our 2010 U.K. pension expense to be approximately 20 million pounds higher than 2009. We do not expect this deterioration in funded states to have an impact on U.K. cash contributions in 2010.", "Following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the first quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail in January decreased at low single digit rates driven by continued economic conditions and the first five weeks of the first quarter our U.K. STRs have decreased at a double digit rate impacted by the coldest January in more than two decades.", "In the US for January most MillerCoors trading day adjusted STRs declined at a high single digit rate. It is important to note that after adjusting for the shift in the Super bowl into February and the impact of the prior year price increase in Puerto Rico, January STR trends were in line with the fourth quarter. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a very small portion of the first quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "In the areas of cost outlook by business, in Canada we currently expect our 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low single digit rate as we anticipate that cost inflation will be more than offset by continued delivery of RFG savings. We expect 2010 cost of good per hectoliter in the U.K. to increase at a mid single digit rate in local currency. Drivers include a shift in our sales mix towards high cost off premise channel and product mix reflecting Cobra and draught Magners volume. We expect cost of goods comparisons to be more challenging in the first half of the year than in the second.", "In the U.S. MillerCoors delivered $250 million in synergies in 2009 bringing the total to $273 million since the beginning operations on July, 2008. The U.S. team now expects to achieve $450 million of cumulative annual synergies by the end of 2010. We expect U.S. cost per hectoliter to continue to increase early in the year and moderate in the second half of the year and these expectations are of course highly dependent on what we see in commodity pricing in overall industry volume.", "So to summarize our discussion today, our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results show the effect of weak industry volume along the continued cost inflation in the U.S. and the U.K. and increased brand building investment in Canada. Most encouraging for the future, we grew or held net pricing and market share in both the U.S. and Canada in the fourth quarter and in the U.K. we drew positive pricing, margins and profit on the back Carlings brand strength. Looking to 2010, we expect volume to remain challenging especially in the first half but we are focused on continuing to establish a strong brand base to our business that ensures we not only manage the current market but we take full advantage of the revenue upsides from momentum influence.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of this call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also 2 PM Eastern Time today, our Investor Relations team led by Dave Dunnewald who will host a follow-up conference call which essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional question regarding our quarter results. That call will also be available for you to hear by our webcast on our website. So, at this point we can open it up for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Judy Wong of Goldman Sachs. ", "Judy Wong - Goldman Sachs", "", "My first question is on Canada and I'm wondering if you can give us some perspective on what the competitive dynamics look like in that market. Obviously we have seen your share improve in that market after some softness earlier in 2009 and I am wondering whether there has been any changes to the competitive situation. So if you can update on that is my first question?", "Dave Perkins", "Its Dave Perkins. Yeah, look. During Q4 we didn\u2019t see any meaningful change from the sort of activity that we saw on Q3. So I would say there is stability there. We continue to have closed our meaningful price gap as we did through the second half. We're satisfied with where we're at. And so overall I would say reasonable stability from Q3. Obviously during the first quarter of 2010 if you see that same level of pricing activity, that will cause us some year-over-year comparison challenges related to pricing because of prior year but I would say overall feeling stable and satisfied with where we find ourselves.", "Judy Wong - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, and then Stewart, the free cash flow generation that you saw in 2009 clearly exceeding your guidance of $575 million underlying. So can you give us what the delta was in terms of what drilled that outperformance and then how we should think about that number as we look out for 2010?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Yeah Judy, really two big drivers for the out performance. One was related to obviously our higher earnings, say year-over-year. The second piece was related to a slightly lower CapEx plus obviously some benefits that are coming from asset sales. I think if you look at where we sit right now, we got about $700 million in cash. This is a business, but working capital wise it would take somewhere around $300 million. We are at the moment in a cash usage period of the year and it's not obvious until we get into the second and particularly the third quarter that we start to really generate cash.", "And at the same time, we do have a couple of opportunities to look at in terms of our balance sheet. Specifically our liabilities are ledged to the Brazilian tax credits. Also we later this year will have some debt maturing and something you will see in our 10-K is that we have a very large pension liability as a result of reduced discount rate. So you're looking at pension liabilities as somewhere in the almost $900 million range.", "So we've got some fairly big items out there on the balance sheet. Clearly, as we move into the back half of the year and we get into the cash generation phase of the year, we'll have a little bit more flexibility to look at other alternatives which we've highlighted in the past which would include obviously growing our business and sharing some of that cash with the shareholders.", "Judy Wong - Goldman Sachs", "And then Peter just from a strategic perspective or in an environment where all of your three markets are seeing an industry volume decline, so if trends really don't get better anytime soon, do you think there is maybe a greater urgency to look at some of the more growth opportunities outside of these markets whether it's in organic basis or looking at strategic opportunities from an acquisition or M&A perspective?", "Peter Swinburn", "We're being pretty consistent on this Judy. We are investing, not heavily but we are investing in new markets and I mentioned the appointment of Kandy earlier. So we are actually going into new markets as we speak with Coors Light but that\u2019s not on an acquisition basis. Our belief is that we can still work our businesses that we've got pretty effectively and we will certainly not at this moment go for a heavy investment in any market that we don\u2019t really have the skill set to work in and we don\u2019t yet feel we have that skill set to something we are building up internally. But we're not there yet.", "Operator", "Thank you. our next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala of UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "", "So when we think about the new Canadian portfolio, could you give us a bit of a read on what your picture of success is now in Canada. Your results are a bit better than they were perhaps the last quarter but if you could maybe give us a little bit of context done on volume or pricing or what you look at as the long term goals for that market?", "Dave Perkins", "Yeah, what we're working towards is really a brand portfolio that covers the broad spectrum of consumer occasions. So, because we're not able to say with certainly what the trends across segments will be, I think it's important to have a portfolio that can deal with the movements that we see going on these days. If you look at the super premium imports, we are well lined up with Corona, Heineken and MVD. You think of about premium domestic, we have the Rickards family. The addition of Rickards Dark has been well received. That is a strong brand for us. The growth in the micro area really gets covered for us with pretty more and more now moving towards Granville Island which allows us to participate there.", "Premium which is really the significant segment in Canada, between Coors Light Canadian and now Molson M and Molson Canadian 67, we feel well positioned across consumer needs that were seeing there and then in value we've recently made some packaging changes on Carling which has been well received but as importantly we just introduced Keystone into Ontario and the Western markets and that will enable us to play in the value segment. So, as we look at our business overall in Canada, our strength is in the mainstream premium and the areas of development opportunity for us are the top end and in the value segment. The moves that we have made recently around our portfolio whether through acquisition or innovation have really helped line us up nicely against those segments. So, success for me looks like building our development in above premium and value while maintaining our strengths in mainstream brand name.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS", "Got it. And then one more follow-up on Canada. With the de-consolidation of the beer store, will that change the pricing dynamic in all that market?", "Dave Perkins", "No that would have no implication to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.", "John Faucher - JPMorgan", "I wanted a follow up on Canada. If I remember correctly, you guys started off the fourth quarter relatively weekly and then rebounded. It appears pretty dramatically given the fourth quarter STR number to the point where you must have been positive potentially as you exited the quarter. So I guess the questions is, as we look at the weakness sequentially, I'm assuming in January, is there anything to that? Is that noise? Has something gotten a little bit worse as we entered into the first quarter of the year or is it something that we really shouldn't pay that much attention to? And also what caused things to get better as we went through the fourth quarter?", "Dave Perkins", "Let me start with the second question. What caused things to get better for us through the final quarter was really the innovation agenda and price competitiveness. So we have been although its early days on innovation, we're very pleased with what we're seeing there in terms of volume and share delivery as well as obviously the strategic strengthening of our brand portfolio. As we look at January, I assume you're referring to the low single digit volume decline and we believe that is fully attributable to economy as opposed to anything that\u2019s happening within our business specifically if that answers your question.", "John Faucher - JPMorgan", "Okay, so it does I guess but given the fact that the economy was probably bad in the fourth quarter, it sounds like its more noise than anything else. In terms of looking at how you exited the year versus how you started, it sounds like it's just a bit of normal volatility. Is that fair?", "Dave Perkins", "Yeah, I think that is fair. We do see ups and down in the industry. You will remember October was a difficult one. You go through all of 2009, you will see several months that bounced around quite significantly. So I'm certainly not reading anything more than the normal volatility and to where we're currently.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Carlos Laboy of Credit Suisse. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "You referenced fixed cost absorption in the U.S. in one of the releases. Do you have flexibility to scale back reduction capacity? Is that a consideration at this point? How are you thinking about that?", "David Perkins ", "Just coming off news here. I think, the thing you remember about our capacity utilization is that we will be full out starting the end of the March through July cards, because if you look at last year we actually chased volume most of the year. ", "So our utilization rates will be great during the peak. What we have to prepare for is more flexibility in the shoulders that\u2019s where we get the leverage that were soft overall market volumes make us most venerable and that\u2019s what showed up in the fourth quarter. ", "So, are there ways to anticipate that better for next year than this year. I think there are yeah, we look at the plans to give us the most flex, and the plan that gives us the most flex in our system today is Golden, but that\u2019s a decision we have to be prepared to take a really good look at coming at summer. ", "Carlos Laboy - Credit Suisse", "Do you see opportunity may be do (audio gap). ", "David Perkins", "Not in the short term just a pragmatics of cross border cost, tariffs etcetera, doesn\u2019t look to be an opportunistic short term play perhaps in the longer term that\u2019s implement beyond the game plan for North America but again you are dealing with a much different scale in breweries and much different tax and tariff realities. ", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel Nicolaus. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Couple of technical questions I guess could you repeat the corporate MG&A numbers to what was your expectation for 2010?", "Stewart Glendenning", "MG&A for 2010 we have $180 million that includes the international fees.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "And then with Brazil we have been hearing about that for a while what's your best guess to when that gets result?", "Stewart Glendenning", "We don\u2019t have a specific date for that, Mark. We think we have got good number that fits in our balance sheet as our best guide. We have ongoing discussions with them as it relates to this regulatory process has also been underway so there are few moving parts we are actively working on brining it to a resolution but I don\u2019t have a date to share with you.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "Lastly Dave, follow-up to John's question about the volatility in the month by month volumes in Canada, can you talk a little bit about innovations, how many points of growth you got from that in the fourth quarter and is it right to think that, that growth moderated in the month of January. Just trying to understand what the underlying trend for your business is?", "Stewart Glendenning", "I wouldn\u2019t want to split out the growth that we have got from innovation and just for competitive reasons but I would say that innovation was a meaningful contributor but the underlying trends on the business we continue to see growth with Coors Light with Rickard we saw growth for our import, the micros and obviously through the innovation but where we continued to see difficulties with Molson Canadian was a mid single digit decline and somewhat moderated from the first half which is good news when you think of potential cannibalization issues and other Molson trademark brands that are being XXX and dry primarily would have been high single digit declines. So overall innovation played an important role for us, but the base business is still certainly the bulk of it. ", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel Nicolaus", "How would you characterize it's role in January versus the quarter? Was it, did it have a similarly meaningful impact?", "Stewart Glendenning", "Yes. I wouldn't characterize it as appreciably different than we saw through the last half of Q4 when those brands were in full effect.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Raghavan Selvaratnam of MainFirst. ", "Raghavan Selvaratnam - MainFirst", "Just that question regarding the U.K. and competitive environment, you have already weighed prices quite significantly in quarter 4 what are you seeing from your competitors and may you lead to the fact that the poor weather in January lead to large drop in volumes and is that also perhaps due to the large prices increases, do you see?", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah, happy to do that. I think it's important to look at the context here we have now had 12 quarters of price increase and certainly over the last five quarters of price increases have been in the double digit range some of that by mix, some of that through our next selling price, you got to remember that not all of those price increases find out their way through to at the retail level, so some of them are renegotiations with our major customers are then absorbed by our customers, so we've been pretty I think consistent and regular with the need in a shrinking market to try and grow value ahead of volume. ", "I really don't want to comment on anything we're seeing in the market place from a competitive perspective pricing out retail continues to remain very, very competitive because our customers remain very, very competitive with one another. Clearly as we commented in January things have been tough across retail and total its just been announced today that the retailing industry had its work candidate for 15 years so certainly the two weeks are very, very vital and well out of the effective all of our sales haven\u2019t been too much into January and December seems a lot weaker to specially back to (inaudible). ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Faucher of JPMorgan.", "John Faucher - JPMorgan", "Yes, actually just a follow-up on a question from before on Judy's question about cash flow. Did you guys provide cash flow guidance for 2010 I didn\u2019t get it, so you can give us an idea what the order of magnitude is going to be there? Thanks. ", "Stewart Glendenning", "Thanks for that question, we have not given guidance yet. We expect in three weeks at our analyst meeting in New York that we will give you some more clarity then. ", "Operator", "Thank you. I assume there are no further questions at this time, sir.", "Peter Swinburn", "Okay, that\u2019s perfect timing. Thanks very much everybody, sorry about the glitch early on but thanks for hanging in there and thanks for interest in the company and we will see a lot of you I am sure in New York in a few weeks time.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference call, Mr. Dave Dunnewald, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.", "David Dunnewald", "Thanks, Kevin. Before we get started, I want to paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussions today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by our executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website at www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab of the Investor Relations Page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. And with that, I'd like to now turn it over to Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors. Peter?", "Peter Swinburn", "Thanks, Dave. Hello, and welcome, everybody. And thanks for joining us today. With me on the call is Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors, CFO; Leo Kiely, CEO of MillerCoors; Gavin Hattersley, CFO of MillerCoors; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, President of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal Officer; Bill Waters, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors Vice President of Investor Relations.", "On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will share highlights of our first quarter 2010 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspectives on the balance of 2010. And then as usual, we will open it for questions.", "So let's get started. In the early part of 2010, we continue to face challenging economic and beer industry conditions primarily as the result of high unemployment and the slow recovery in consumer confidence. These conditions negatively affected our company's volume and financial performance with Molson Coors worldwide volume declining 3.8% and underlying pretax income down 19% versus a year ago.  Adding the impact of a much higher tax rate this year, underlying after-tax income decreased 29.5% in the first quarter. ", "More importantly from our perspective, we are seeing signs of progress in key areas of our business as a result of our continued investment and focus on brands and innovation. In Canada, as we indicated on our last earnings call, challenging pricing and cost comparisons resulted in lower earnings in the first quarter versus a year ago. But our strong volume and market share performances demonstrated the benefit of the brand innovations we rolled out late last year and early this year. ", "Based on the current environment, the strength of our Canada portfolio will drive improving results over the balance of the year. And despite a 3.6% drop in MillerCoors domestic volume, our U.S. underlying income grew slightly in the first quarter due to positive pricing and aggressive cost reductions. We are pleased with these results in a difficult volume quarter and look forward to improved sales as the economy recovers.", "In the U.K., the strength of our brands continue to boost margins as they have over the past two years. Having achieved this, we now expect to drive more stable U.K. market share as the year progresses. Overall, our core business remains strong and well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.", "During our most recent briefing between investors and analysts in early March in New York, we provided a detailed look at how we are executing our strategies around brands, innovation and cost reductions. Let me take a moment to update you on our progress against those priorities in the first quarter.", "On brands, despite tough economic conditions, we remain committed to a strategy of continued brand investment because we believe that a strong portfolio of brands is the key to growing profitably as markets improve.", "In Canada, in the first quarter, we saw growth in Molson Canadian for the first time in four years. And Coors Light continued to achieve strong growth. In fact, Coors Light is now the largest selling beer in Canada.", "In the U.K., we continue to see the benefits of our brand-building and pricing strategies. And In the U.S. industry volume remains weak, but five out of our six strategic brands again grew market share in the first quarter. And we are confident that our branded innovations efforts will be rewarded as conditions improve. ", "When we met with many of you two months ago in New York, we discussed our commitment to innovation as a driver of growth and the ability of Molson Coors to own innovation and lead the industry in this area. I'm especially pleased with the progress we've made over the past few months to bring innovations to market that offer compelling value propositions for beer drinkers. ", "Key examples include introducing or expanding Molson M, Canadian 67, Rickard's Dark, Keystone and Miller Chill in Canada, along with home draft, aluminum pint bottles, Blue Moon cans, wartex bottles for Miller Light and code-activated packaging for Coors Light in the U.S. and Blue Moon draft, cold-activated cans for Coors Light and taste-lock cans for Carling in the U.K. These innovations help to drive positive market share in the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter and positive pricing in the U.K.", "On costs, we committed to deliver $150 million of resources for growth to savings by 2012, along with our share of $700 million of savings of MillerCoors.", "In the first quarter, we exceeded our cost reduction targets with $15 million of RFG2 savings and $60 million of MillerCoors cost reductions, underscoring again our ability to meet or exceed our cost commitments through our disciplined approach to these critical initiatives. ", "We have also achieved a favorable resolution of Brazilian tax indemnities and announced a dividend increase and the purchase of a controlling share in the Si'hai Brewery in China. Stewart will discuss these in the context of our $760 million free cash flow target and our cash use priorities.", "So with that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to review first quarter financial results and highlights of our brands, innovation and cost reductions across our company. And then, we'll cover the outlook for 2010. Stewart?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 3.8% from a year ago, driven by industry weakness in the U.S. and U.K., as well as our pricing strategy in the U.K. ", "On the bottom line underlying after tax income of $69.7 million or $0.37 per diluted share, decreased 29.5% from a year ago due to lower volume, higher marketing, general and administrative expense and a higher effective tax rate this year. ", "It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings excludes some non-core gains, losses and expenses primarily related to a sale of real estate, changes in the value of our fastest cash-settled total-return swap in MillerCoors integration costs, as well as net special charges of $2.6 million. ", "The adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results we share with you today will be in U.S. dollars. And results comparisons will be versus the comparable prior-year period.", "In segment performance highlights starting with Canada. Underlying pretax income and local currency decreased 14% in the first quarter. Strong volume in operations, cost reductions in the quarter were more than offset by cycling lower levels of price discounting a year ago, along with higher commercial and overhead costs this year. ", "Our prior-year results included overhead cost reductions, favorable impacts from consolidating the beer stores in Ontario and equity income from our interest in the Montr\u00e9al Canadiens hockey club. These prior-year impacts which did not reoccur this year accounted for more than 70% of the decline in first quarter Canada local currency income. ", "In U.S. dollars, Canada underlying earnings decreased 3.3% to $56.2 million in the first quarter, which reflects the $9 million benefit of a 21% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.", "So let's review some highlights. Our Canada sales to retail or STRs for the calendar quarter ended March 31, increased 5%. We estimate that about half of this increase was driven by our successful sponsorship of the Winter Olympic games in February along with an earlier timing of the Easter holiday this year. ", "Strong brand performance also drove our Canada STRs with mid-single-digit growth from Coors Light and Molson Canadian brands along with positive growth for Molson Dry and Rickard's, partially offset by a decline in Molson Export in our nonstrategic brands. We are off to a solid start in the revitalization of Molson Canadian by leveraging our sponsorship during the Olympics, launching new ad creative and packaging, continuing to drive distribution of Molson Canadian, of Canadian 67, and ensuring competitive pricing in our regional markets.", "During the first quarter, we also launched Molson M into the Atlantic region, Keystone into the West and Ontario regions, and Rickard\u2019s Dark across the rest of Canada. These brand initiatives along with the addition of Granville Island volume and incremental sales from the Vancouver Winter Olympics held in February, helped us to increase our market share a 0.5 a point versus a year ago.", "Total Canadian beer industry sales to retail increased an estimated 3.8% in the calendar first quarter, driven in part by the Winter Olympics and Easter holiday timing. Our Canada sales volume at 1.8 million hectoliters in the first quarter, up 3.3%. Net sales per hectoliter declined 2.7% in local currency. About 2/3 of this decline was driven by cycling our less-competitive price position in the first half of 2009, which we expect to fully cycle by this summer. ", "During the second quarter last year, we began implementing strategies to make our brands more competitive in Canada, including more competitive pricing for some brands and markets. Balance of the decrease in sales per hectoliter was due to lower export sales to the U.S.", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.6% in local currency in the first quarter driven by the net effect of two factors. First, savings from our RFG2 program reduced cost of goods sold per hectoliter by more than three percentage points. And second, lower export volume to the U.S. reduced the cost of goods sold rate by about 1.4 percentage points.", "Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter increased 12.7% in local currency, with a little over 1/3 of the change driven by higher commercial and innovation spending to build brands. The balance of the increase was due to prior-year benefits that included the last two months of consolidating the Ontario beer stores, along with adding Granville Island overhead costs this year. Other income decreased $5.5 million in the first quarter due to foreign currency movements and the lack of the Montr\u00e9al Canadiens equity income this year.", "Moving to our U.K. business. In the first quarter, underlying pretax profit of $2.1 million represents a decrease of $1.4 million due to a $7.1 million non-cash increase in defined benefit pension expense. If we excluded the first quarter increase in pension expense, our U.K. underlying pretax income would have more than doubled driven by positive benefits of continuing to leverage our contract brewing arrangements, brand-building efforts and strong pricing. Our first quarter U.K. results include only minimal impact from foreign exchange movements.", "By looking at first quarter highlights, our U.K.-owned brand volume increased 10.9% due to declining industry volume, partly as a result of poor weather. Volume was also impacted in the first quarter as we worked on concluding contract negotiations with some of our major customers, especially in the off premise channel.", "Total U.K. beer industry volume declined approximately 5% in the first quarter. Net sales per hectoliter of our owned products increased 21% in local currency with about 13 percentage points driven by higher pricing in all channels as we continued to benefit from our strategy and forego low-margin volume and eight percentage points as a result of positive sales mix, predominately due to growth in Magners Cider and Cobra.", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter of our own products increased 22% in local currency driven by five factors: Incremental pension expense represented four percentage points of this increase, 1% was due to input cost inflation; seven percentage points were due to mix, driven by growth in Draught Magners Cider and Cobra and higher employee related costs; seven percentage points of the increase was due to fixed cost deleverage related to lower owned brand volumes; and three percentage points predominantly relating to 2009 performance that we do not expect impact the balance of this year.", "Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. increased 10% in local currency with six percentage points due to higher pension expense this year. Balance was due to information systems investments and the cost of adding the Cobra sales force and higher employee-related costs.", "In our U.S. segment. Underlying pretax income increased 0.4% to $94.6 million in the first quarter driven by MillerCoors results. Looking at total MillerCoors P&L. First quarter underlying net income increased 0.4% to $217.2 million due to favorable U.S. pricing and delivery of cost-savings, which were offset by soft volumes, cost deleverage and commodity price pressures.", "MillerCoors domestic STRs declined 4% driven by continued weak economic conditions affecting the entire industry. Domestic sales-to-wholesalers declined 3.6% driven primarily by lower retail sales.", "Total net revenue decreased 0.9% to $1.7 billion. Nonetheless, pricing remained strong in the quarter as domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales increased 2.1%. Cost of goods sold or COGS per hectoliter increased 5.9% driven by increases in commodity costs with significant increases in brewing materials, malt and corn, packaging materials, glass and aluminum and higher fuel costs. COGS per hectoliter continued to be negatively impacted by the absorption of fixed and semi variable costs across lower production volumes. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased by 9.2% primarily due to synergies.", "In our International and Corporate segment, the underlying pretax loss for International and Corporate combined was $65.8 million in the first quarter, an increase of $17.4 million driven by three factors. First, higher interest expense due to a year-over-year appreciation of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. Dollar; second, cost to implement our RSG2 cost reduction initiatives; and third, the timing difference in the company's incentive compensation expense, which is more heavily weighted towards the first quarter this year versus the second quarter in previous years. As a result, first quarter of Corporate net interest expense increased $4.3 million. And Corporate general and administrative expense increased $12.3 million to $33.4 million. ", "It is important to note that a significant portion of the first quarter of Corporate G&A expense increase was due to timing, or infrequent factors. As a result, we expect Corporate G&A to be roughly flat for the balance of this year. ", "Our international team grew sales volume nearly 20% in the first quarter up a small base, driven by sales in China and Europe. Speaking of China, we announced this morning that we have signed an agreement to form a joint venture with Hebei Si'hai Beer Company in China for a total cash investment of approximately $40 million. We will gain a 51% controlling interest in the joint venture, which will be called Molson Coors Si'hai Brewing company. ", "This JV will give us access to a quality regional brewery for the production of Molson Coors brands along with sales of the regionally strong Si'hai brands. We expect this new venture to be accretive in the short term and to grow long-term shareholder value by reducing costs and increasing the growth potential for Coors Light in the world's largest beer market by volume. We plan to close the transaction this summer.", "Back to first quarter results. MG&A expense for international was $11.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.6 million due to brand investments in our priority international markets. Corporate other expense was $7.4 million driven by a $6.9 million non-cash mark-to-market loss related to the total return swap we arranged with respect to Foster's common stock. As a result, as usual, mark-to-market to gains and losses on the Foster swap are excluded from our underlying earnings.", "Now, highlights of our cost reduction initiatives. We kicked off our RFG2 program in the first quarter with $15 million of cost-savings towards the program's three-year goal of $150 million. In addition to our RFG2 savings, MillerCoors delivered $53 million of incremental cost synergies in the first quarter toward the original $500 million three-year synergy commitment. MillerCoors also delivered $7 million of cost reductions against its new $200 million cost-savings program to be delivered by the end of 2012. We benefit from 42% of the MillerCoors cost savings.", "Moving beyond, operating business performance. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 16% on a reported basis and 19% on an underlying basis. With a regard to our balance sheet during the first quarter, we reached an agreement with FEMSA to settled some indemnity liabilities related to purchase tax credits in Brazil. Resolution of these liabilities stem from a Brazilian tax amnesty program announced last year for a cash payment of $96 million. ", "This favorable settlement eliminated $284.5 million of maximum potential tax claims, of which $131.2 million of indemnity liabilities were accrued on our balance sheet. The result is a $42.6 million gain related to discontinued operations in the first quarter. With this settlement a reserve of less than $25 million for Brazil indemnities remains on our balance sheet.", "Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.74 billion. And cash, and cash equivalents totaled $657 million, resulting in a net debt of $1.08 billion. The first quarter each year is generally a cash-use quarter because of the seasonality of the beer business. ", "The cash flow for the first quarter of this year reflected a net cash use of $34 million, which was made up of $86 million of operating cash flow, plus $2 million of proceeds from asset sales, minus capital spending of $23 million and $99 million of net cash contributed to MillerCoors.", "This free cash flow result was an improvement of $46 million primarily due to improved working capital this year, partially offset by an increase in net cash provided to MillerCoors. If we exclude cash uses by MillerCoors to capture synergies and to buy the distribution rights for Miller and other brands in Denver, along with the return of collateral cash related to MillerCoors commodity hedges, our underlying free cash flow for the first quarter total a negative $5 million cash use, a substantial improvement from underlying free cash flow of negative $61 million in cash use a year ago. Note that the Brazil settlement was not paid until the first day of our fiscal second quarter, so this cash use will be included in second quarter results.", "With regard to our use of free cash flow, in addition to the favorable Brazil settlement, we announced yesterday our third consecutive annual dividend increase, this time a 16.7% increase to an annual dividend rate of $1.12 per share.", "Looking forward, we continue to expect full-year 2010 MG&A expense in the International Corporate segment of approximately $180 million plus or minus 5%. We now forecast full-year 2010 Corporate interest expense to be approximately $110 million at today's foreign exchange rates.", "Turning to our effective tax rate. We expect our full-year underlying tax rate for 2010 to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. We continue to expect our normalized long-term tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 26% after this year. Our 2010 capital spending outlook remains approximately $150 million for the full year. As always, this guidance excludes MillerCoors. At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a look ahead to the balance of 2010. Peter?", "Peter Swinburn", "Thank you, Stewart. In 2010 we continue to focus on brand-building, innovation, reducing costs across our company and generating cash. In Canada, we've introduced new brands and innovation to strengthen our portfolio. The early results are encouraging. As indicated by our positive Canada share trends in the last two quarters. ", "This brand-led focus will continue with the upcoming expansion of Miller Chill across Canada early this summer. By summer, we also expect to have cycled nearly all of the step-up in price discounting activity last year. At the same time, the Canadian dollar is strong. The economy has started to show encouraging signs of improvement and based on the strength of our brands, we are achieving moderate, selective price increases in most regions of Canada.", "In the U.K., the business has continued to make substantial progress in improving profitability. We are succeeding with our strategy of value ahead of volume, which continues to strengthen our overall position within the U.K. market.", "Although the U.K. business lost market share in the first quarter, we are confident that our share trends will improve in the balance of the year. We are taking a number of actions in key areas of the business to drive momentum. In the off premise, trading deals have been signed with all major retail chains.", "In the on premise, nearly all major customer contracts have also been renegotiated with annual price increases on an average three-year contract life. We are growing portfolio strength in a number of areas, including Cobra performing ahead of acquisition objectives and Coors Light growing at strong double-digit rate in the off-premise, and increasing share in Ireland.", "In the U.S., we successfully grew profit despite a challenging selling environment in the first quarter. As we enter the key summer selling season, we're investing in brand innovation, chain account focus, execution, quality and people to win in U.S. beer. As we continue to deal with economic and competitive pressures, we remain focused on building our brands and managing costs.", "Following, are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail in April declined at a low single digit rate due in part to the Easter holiday shift. In the first five weeks of the second quarter, our U.K. STRs have decreased at a low double-digit rate. In the U.S., for the four weeks ending April 24, MillerCoors STRs declined at a low-single-digit rate due to continued industry softness with some trend improvement aided by favorable weather in April. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a very small portion of the second quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "In the area of cost outlook by business. In Canada, we continue to expect our 2010 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate in local currency driven primarily by the delivery of RFG2 cost-savings.", "In the U.K., we now expect 2010 cost of goods per hectoliter of our own product to increase at a high single-digit rate in local currency. Drivers include the step up in pension expense this year, a low-single-digit increase in input cost inflation, which is a substantial improvement over last year, and a shift in our sales mix towards the high cost off-premise channel, as well as product mix reflecting more Cobra and Draught Magners volume. We expect cost of goods comparisons to be more challenging in the first half of the year than in the second half, due to less fixed cost deleverage and cycling of the Cobra acquisition in the second half.", "In the first quarter, we also agreed a multi-year agreement to contract brew ales for Carlsberg beginning in 2011 which will help us to continue to maximize U.K. asset utilization.  In the U.S., MillerCoors remains on track to deliver $750 million in total synergies and other cost-savings by the end of 2012. Supply-chain integration continues to proceed on schedule.", "The brewery optimization project is nearing completion as beer production moves are more than 90% complete. The next phase of supply-chain integration will include the realignment of teams in quality, engineering and packaging and manufacturing and supply-chain development. We expect U.S. COGS per hectoliter will be up at a low-single-digit rate for the full year of 2010, though we anticipate some degree of fluctuation within the year. We expect to see a low-single-digit increase in the second quarter and approximately flat for the second half of the year.", "So to summarize our discussion today, despite challenging economic and industry conditions, we have continued to execute our strategies for brands, innovation and cost reduction, which we outlined in New York earlier this year. We are encouraged by the trends we are seeing as a result of the right investment in brands and innovation and aggressive cost reductions in each of our businesses. As a result, we believe our company is stronger and better positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as the economy recovers.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time today, our Investor Relations team, led by David Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, essentially a working session for analysts and investors who have additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. So at this point, let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christine Farkas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I had a question on Canada, a couple of questions on Canada, if I could. First thing on pricing, down 2.7%. It seems to me and please correct me if I'm wrong that sales mix might have been favorable. And I think there was a step up in Quebec minimum pricing in core [Audio Gap] Take us through the net of the pricing and the mix and perhaps regionally, where you might have seen some more discounting?", "David Perkins", "Yes, Christine, it's Dave Perkins. So on the 2.7, about 2/3 of that is due to the cycling, our less competitive position last year. What we've seen this year is reasonable stability in the pricing environment. I think Quebec has been quite stable. We haven't seen much change in recent quarters. What we have seen obviously as we've moved through successive quarters is a drop off of the benefit that we get from general price increases that went into effect over a year ago. So that actually is the reason that we've seen this drop off in NSR per hectoliter. There really hasn't been the kind of mix issues -- the one thing I would point out is in the last few weeks and months, and in particular, during February and March, we were able to put in place moderate price increases on selective brands and packages in nine of our 10 provinces. So there has been price increases going into effect.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And if I can follow up on cost of goods, in Canada, it's sharply different than in the U.S. where you're enjoying lower cost of goods, where in the U.S. it's higher. So I'm trying to understand the picture on the commodities front, perhaps offset by the fixed cost leverage. Maybe you compare why we're seeing such a difference in that management?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Stewart here. Maybe I could pick that up. I think the first thing is to bear in mind that each of these geographies got a fairly different mix just in terms of costs. So your U.S., for example, has about 50% of its -- roughly half of its costs are in packaging materials. Whereas in Canada, it's less than 1/3. So right there is a big difference in terms of why you're not seeing that packaging cost coming through in Canada quite as strongly. The other thing to bear in mind in Canada is that over the last year you've seen a strengthening of the U.S. dollar by approximately 20%. And that will have influence some areas they otherwise would have seen cost increases in, particularly metals and fuel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A couple questions on Canada, starting either with you, Stewart or you, Dave. On the MG&A, if we assume kind of a flat volume picture in Canada for the rest of the year, is a 4% kind of increase in MG&A the right way to be thinking about it or a reasonable way to be thinking about it, local currency?", "David Perkins", "Well, Mark, I can't give guidance on that. Let me just review a couple of facts that will be helpful. Of the 12.7% increase in MG&A in our first quarter, 1/3 of that was increased commercial spend. The balance is related to Granville and some prior-year benefits, such as BRI deconsolidation and some other overhead savings. So I just point that out and then the other thing I just remind you is last year in 2009, you'll remember in the first half of the year, our MG&A was flat over the prior year. Q3, we increased 4% and Q4, we increased 14%. So there's obviously implications to cycling that. So hopefully, that's somewhat helpful to you.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Dave, also on Keystone, trying to get my arms around how significant this could be in Canada. Can you -- first -- I guess a couple of questions, number one, how is it priced versus Coors Light and Molson Canadian? And then secondly, how is it going? And thirdly, I think it's only, you said only in Western Ontario, what's your intention or what's the potential for it to be in other provinces as we move through the year?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Well, Keystone is actually in Ontario and Western Canada, so it's in a total of five provinces. They'd account for around 2/3 of the country. So it's in significant geography. The value -- it's priced in the value segment, so it is up against other value brands in the marketplace. And the value category in those markets that I've talked about would be in and around 20% of the market. Now the significance of the brand over time, we'll see. I mean, we're in very early days. We're driving distribution and awareness and trial right now. I'm pleased with what I'm seeing in the early days. But as I say, we've only been in a few weeks really. We're at the distribution levels that we want now, we have TV advertising supporting the brand. And so we're starting to build the awareness in trial that we need. But, it's very difficult to give you a clear sense of the upside potential on this at this point.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And than lastly Dave, why not keep talking about Canada here. Limelight obviously had a great summer last year. Can you just give us a sense how they're performing here in the early spring? And in your mind, what are the parts of your portfolio that are most directly going against them?", "David Dunnewald", "So the lime products last summer did very well during their first two months. They actually tailed off quite significantly post-Labor Day, post the September long weekend. And we've seen some discounting. I think because of inventory builds on some of the competitive products. So far, what we've seen this spring is not a major pop-up. But I mean the limes are still significant. We've come in with Miller Chill, which is our product in that segment. Again, we're in early days with that as we are with Keystone, we're building trial and awareness. It is going in across the country so it'll be a full national launch. And it will be supported in a meaningful way. So we feel good about our level of competitiveness. So far, we haven't seen the big bump up in the segment yet. But I think we're watching for the May long weekend which is when the warmer weather kicks in and usually you'll see products like this start to take hold.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Marc Greenberg with Deutsche Bank.", "Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "Peter, during the call, some of the press reporting that MillerCoors has bowed out of the NFL sponsorship, for Coors Light. Particularly curious here, as over the years you all have talked about how important that's been to Coors Light and its growth. So two parts really. First, with regards to the brand, how are you going to make up for losing such a big sponsor? And secondly, what kind of a cost impact might that have with regards to the U.S. business?", "Peter Swinburn", "I'm going to pass that on to Leo and Tom because I know that they've got all the answers to those. So Leo, do you want to pick that up?", "Leo Kiely", "Yes, Marc. It is no secret that the trademark negotiations for the NFL marks was up for renegotiation starting with the 2011, 2012 season. So that's -- that's a year away. Until midnight last night, we had a -- what we felt was a full value offer on the table that expired at midnight. That story broke on us this morning. This was a long-term decision based on our sense that the NFL marks were fully valued. And we look at each of those situations one up and one at a time. The two important points to remember. First -- first of all, we have a full season ahead of us, where we're fully committed to in 2010 and 2011, activating behind those marks on Coors Light before there's any change. Secondly, as you probably know, we have several -- in fact, Tom may even have the number, of very successful programs and activations with teams in our key markets, and those -- those have in some cases multiple years left on those activations. So we're comfortable with this. I don't think it's going to cost us anything. I think the question is how do we get smarter about how we spend those dollars and activate them behind the portfolio. So that's our point of view.", "Marc Greenberg - Deutsche Bank AG", "Leo, I guess when I was talking about cost, I was really alluding to what kind of dollars may come back into the marketing portfolio as a consequence of not spending behind the NFL.", "Leo Kiely", "Yes. I don't think we've been public about what our baseline was on that. And we don't know, by the way, where the NFL's finally going to come out on this. So, I mean, I have to be very careful and respectful about that, but it gives us a significant amount of money to reallocate. And our judgment is we can reallocated it long-term more effectively, activating our innovation and a full mix of properties. In fact, I think it's an opportunity that's different for us as a new company than it was as Coors. So, hey, look. NFL's a great property. We're not running away from the NFL. We have tremendous advertising commitments there and we'll continue to. This is really how you activate trademarks and brands and these are decisions you have to make. I feel really confident about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Carlos LaBoy with Credit Suisse.", "Carlos LaBoy - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse First Boston, Inc.", "Can you, Peter, can you give us some more insight on this announcement you made on this China investment; why start in this province with this brewer, maybe how much you paid for it per hectoliter? But more importantly, how do you look at capital requirements for China going forward? Is there going to be a major deployment of cash behind China and is this -- this is just the start of it?", "Peter Swinburn", "I'll let Kandy talk about the detail, Carlos, but to the general point, the answer's absolutely, no. If you remember in New York, we -- I think we tried to make it quite clear that our approach to our investment into developing markets in particular is that we don't want to send capital ahead of our brand development. So we go in, we develop the brand. We've been doing that in China in a pretty disciplined way for seven to eight years now. The brand has built up to -- it's in 42 different cities. It's national. It's got a critical mass. And so the actual equation for us is that we've got brand health scores, we've got brand momentum. And therefore, it makes it sensible for us to actually put fairly limited investment into a brewing capacity, which will give us both security of supply -- a quality of supply. But also we can justify it because we already have that critical of volume to date. So that really is the approach we take. We don't see ourselves putting more capital into China on top of this, we've got no plans for that at the moment. But obviously, as hopefully as the brand develops, we might review that, but that's a long, long way off. Kandy, any additions on that?", "Krishnan Anand", "Just to build on what Peter said, as you know since 2003, our business in China has been growing at about 30% per annum. So we thought this is the right time for us to take the next step in China. This joint venture, what specifically it does is allows us to further expand our distribution channels, gives us greater control on our brewing, increases our cost efficiency in China as well as more flexibility on packaging and brand innovation, that allows us to grow our share in the market. The Si'hai group is an attractive partner for us because of its strength in the Hebei province, which is north of Beijing. And its proven ability to build a cost effective and portfolio -- and profitable business in a fairly intensely competitive environment. So that's the strategic rationale and Peter explained to you our overall strategy around investments over there.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from a follow up from Christine Farkas from Bank of America.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I just wanted to follow up, Peter, on the Brazilian liability, now just to understand that is completely put to bed, that there'll be no more cash payments or negotiations on this topic?", "Peter Swinburn", "Well, certainly on this specific topic, Christine. No, that is put to bed. There are some other, as Stewart outlined, we do have some other issues on our balance sheet that are pretty minimal and we're much more confident of a successful outcome on them. But Stewart can give you the details.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Yes. To Peter's point, this was a more volatile enough part of the liability. I did highlight during the call that we've got less than $25 million on the balance sheet for remaining issues in Brazil. And that we feel that, that's a fair representation of the liability there.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Finally on your Fosters stake, I realize there's mark-to-market impacts every quarter. But could you tell us if your strategic thinking has changed there? Or if that value or if that investment is actually now smaller than it was before?", "Peter Swinburn", "No, Christine. It's not moved. The investment hasn't moved and our position really hasn't moved either. I don't think I can add much more to that which we've already said.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back over to you, Peter, for closing comments.", "Peter Swinburn", "Thanks, very much Kevin. And thank you everybody for your questions and for the interest in the business. And we look forward to speaking to you again in the end of the next quarter's results. Thanks a lot. Bye now.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation.

Now I'd like to turn the call over to David Dunnewald, VP of Investor Relations, Molson Coors.", "David Dunnewald", "Thanks, Devon. Hello, and welcome, everybody. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our Fourth Quarter 2010 Follow-up Earnings Conference Call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our regular earnings conference call with Peter Swinburn, Stewart Glendinning and our business unit CEOs earlier today.", "We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour. So let's get started. ", "With me on the call are Leah Ramsey, Investor Relations Manager; Greg Snyder, Group Manager of Global Forecasting and Analysis; Spencer Shearer [ph], Finance Forecasting Manager; Steve Hills, Financial Reporting Manager; Mark Sacks [ph], Senior Director of Tax; and Bill Waters, Vice President and Global Controller. ", "As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our earlier regular earnings call earlier today, 2010 was a year of good progress for Molson Coors in building exceptional brand, driving value-enhancing innovation, reducing costs, strengthening our balance sheet and generating cash. As a result, we increased gross margins, operating income, pretax income and free cash flow despite continued input cost inflation and weak industry volume. In 2011, we will be more focused than ever on driving momentum on the top line and bottom line and growing substantial value for our shareholders.", "Now before we get to the Q&A, I wanted to follow up on one question we had earlier this morning on the regular earnings call, and that was relating specifically to Corporate and International markets' MG&A. ", "In our call this morning, we provided guidance that we anticipate that MG&A expense for the Corporate and International segment will be approximately $200 million plus or minus 5%. That represents approximately a $28 million increase from 2010. And we said it was driven by higher brand investments in our International business and the addition of 100% of our China joint venture expenses. You remember, we closed the Si'hai Brewing joint venture in the fall. ", "And then the minority owner share of those increased expenses from the China joint venture, we're just layering them in, actually, will be subtracted from our consolidated results in the line, Noncontrolling Interests. What I wanted to emphasize is that this guidance is only for that segment. It is not total company, Molson Coors' MG&A. So it's just for that one segment, first of all. ", "And then second of all, it's not earnings guidance, because it does include operating businesses in places like China, Japan, Vietnam and Spain and so on. The operating performance of that segment will also be driven not only by MG&A expense but also by international market sales and cost of goods. So I just wanted to emphasize that point. ", "And with that, I'd like to open it up for your questions. Devon?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So I guess, two things here, but maybe as a follow-up to the conversation in the morning call, can you kind of update all of us on your COGS mix by region? And any color you can give us on how and to what extent contracts and market-based hedges are benefiting your COGS expectations for '11?", "David Dunnewald", "We did definitely want to follow up on that. I guess, I'd start with -- give you three pieces of information. One, the amount of information we give on hedges is somewhat limited, as it is from our competitors just for, call it, competitive reasons. But we do provide some general guidance around what our COGS -- the makeup of our cost of goods by business unit and then a little bit of perspective on our hedging. The route to market and the package mix drive substantial differences in our cost of goods base in each of the three major businesses that we have. For example, the U.S. market, U.S. business, about 40% of the cost of goods line there is packaging materials, because we have a lot of nonreturnable packaging and not very much draft as well, which I guess, that's a subset of the first point. In Canada, on the other hand, there's a lot more in the area of distribution. We have returnable bottles, there's over half the package mix in Canada, which reduces the packaging materials component, but a lot of distribution. And then in the U.K., you have a high component of draft beer, which reduces packaging materials even more. But you also, on the flip side, you have what we call factored brands, which are beverage brands that are owned by other companies that we take possession of and therefore, have to consolidate in our U.K. business, and we deliver those to pubs all over the U.K. So that's basically why you have differences between the business units. And I can go into whatever detail you need as far as the breakout of packaging materials versus brewing materials, but if we don't need that, I'm just going to give you the headline that, when it comes to hedging strategy, we believe in limiting volatility of those inputs where we have the opportunity to reduce risk and volatility. And the mix, call it as a percent of cost of goods of hedgeable commodities, really does vary quite a bit by geography. For example, in the U.S., if you distill it down, essentially about 1/5 of the cost of goods line is hedgeable commodities. So the other 4/5 are things like conversion costs and labor costs, depreciation, things like that, that are not hedgeable. And then if we move to Canada and the U.K., roughly 1/10 of the cost of goods lines there are hedgeable. Now this doesn't tell you that every year, we will hedge exactly 1/10 or exactly 1/5, depending on the geography, but it does tell you what the potential is by market. Beyond that, I would tell you that our strategy, because we do believe in volatility mitigation, we tend to hedge out a ways. Generally, it's rolling hedging over two to three years, where that's available. It's not available in all places, but as you can tell by the numbers in the U.S., more commodities are hedgeable than in some of the other markets, plus the fractions I gave you indicate the different makeup of the cost of goods line in those geographies.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "When you use the term hedgeable, would you consider a long-term contract a source of hedge, or something that in that portion that is not hedgeable?", "David Dunnewald", "I would say a long-term contract if it, how do you say, eliminates rate movement, then yes, I would throw that in the hedgeable bucket. We hedge through a variety of instruments, financial, contract, just storage, for example, when it comes to malt, things like that. So I guess, the answer is yes.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then back on that first part of your response there, when you said packaging, 40% in the U.S., lower in Canada, lower in the U.K., can you put a number on what those numbers are for Canada and the U.K., what packaging is? And then I guess, part of distribution's going to show up below the gross profit line, but can you talk too about distribution more specifically, put some numbers around distribution?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, I can give you broad guidelines. The packaging materials, I already mentioned the U.S. about 40%. In Canada, it's about a half of that or roughly 1/5 of the cost of goods line. And then in the U.K., mid-teens percent of cost of goods is related to packaging material. The cost of kegs, because they're so reusable for generally 10 to 20 years tends to be very low cost for our business in the U.K. As far as distribution goes, I guess I'd clarify that a little bit. Distribution costs in the U.S., we would -- simply the cost of our -- the independent distributors we have, that's borne by them, not by us, with the exception of the one distributor we own in Denver, and that distributorship is fully consolidated. So you have a whole range of costs throughout the P&L for Miller Coors associated with Coors Distributing Company in Denver. So if we set that aside, essentially, in the U.S. business, MillerCoors, you have freight charges, shipping primarily finished goods freight from our packaging facilities to our distributors, the 700 or so distributors around the country. And so there's a high fuel component of that, and it's about 1/5 of the U.S. cost of goods line. Then if you move to Canada, a combination of -- that system has a lot more warehousing, a lot more distribution costs, frankly, in it, and that's just the makeup of the market. So about a third of the Canadian market is a combination of distribution, freight, logistics, that sort of thing. And then, if you move to the U.K. business, you'd come in around mid-teens on distribution and freight costs.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And then finally, on that topic, brewing materials, what kind of numbers are we talking about?", "David Dunnewald", "Brewing materials, because there's more consistency across geographies, they don't vary quite as much. The U.S. market, you'd be around 1/10 for brewing materials and related utilities. In other words, we buy the barley, and then we use some utilities to convert it into malt. You'd see the same sort of number in Canada, around 1/10, and then the U.K., same thing, broadly speaking, 10% or a little bit lower.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And if we tally up the numbers you just gave for each region, obviously, it doesn't get to 100%. Most of the difference, labor and manufacturing overhead, that kind of stuff?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. Essentially, then to fill out the picture, in the U.S., you have about 1/5 of the cost of goods line would be plant manufacturing, that's labor, some related utilities. You'd put depreciation, property tax, those types of things into that bucket. So about 1/5 there, same thing in Canada, about 1/5 of the cost of goods line. And then in the U.K., it would be a little bit lower, more of a mid-teens number, and that's because the cost of goods line is, call it, enlarged by the factored brands that I mentioned earlier.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "It\u2019s kind of an old topic that seems to be more pressing today, anything new you can tell us beyond what Stewart said and Peter said on the call about deployment of cash flow? Because Stewart talks -- he was pretty -- I don't know, you can over-interpret these things, but statement of fact, Foster's isn\u2019t a claim on cash flow anymore. Statement of fact, the pension situation is better than it was six months ago. Statement of fact, you just completed a very cash-generative year. So it really seems like you're keyed up to do -- and statement of fact, you don't have much in the way of absolute borrowing. So people are left thinking you're going to go do something big acquisition-wise, or that the odds are going up that you actually return more cash to shareholders than you have in the past, and yet, of course, people have been disappointed there over the years. So what besides what we heard this morning, if anything, can you tell us given the picture that we're all looking at?", "David Dunnewald", "That's a good question. I'm sure it's on the minds of a lot of investors. We do have -- we did achieve some very positive cash generation last year. We do have, call it, a solid cash balance at the end of the year on our balance sheet. And, I guess, all I would do is reiterate what we\u2019ve said in the past, and that is we're going to look at potential cash uses in three main buckets. First one is growth opportunities. We've done a number of relatively modest-sized growth opportunities, things such as China and the most recent brand acquisition in the U.K., Granville Island, those types of things, Cobra in the U.K. as well. So those are relatively small bolt-on acquisitions. We've done MillerCoors, which was relatively large. And so as we've said in the past, we'll look at a variety of growth opportunities, and we will run them through a disciplined process, where the two main criteria are: We need to see short-term earnings accretion; and also, a clear view to growing long-term shareholder value, which is kind of a verbal way of saying ROIC needs to be growing in excess of our weighted average cost of capital. In that same disciplined process -- or we will apply that same disciplined process to balance sheet improvements. And to your point, Mark, we have made some significant improvements in the last year in that area, around pensions and Brazil indemnities, and those types of things. So we'll continue to see whether or not there are opportunities there, but as you suggest, we have taken some of those at least in the near term, off the table. It doesn't tell you what we'll do down the road, but we've certainly made good progress in a couple of key areas.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And am I right in thinking that with the way your board normally meets and having your Analyst Day on March 2, it's kind of -- it requires a special meeting of your board to give us an update on that on March 2?", "David Dunnewald", "I always caution people about tagging a specific date on board meetings and that sort of thing, because there's quite a bit of both variability and flexibility when the board does and can meet. So I think looking for those types of signposts, it may not be fruitful. So I'm not sure I'd spend a lot of time on that, but that's your choice. One thing I would do is just mention the last bucket which is, returning cash to shareholders. And as Stewart mentioned, we've increased the dividend three years running, and as part of that dialogue with our board that we have on an ongoing basis, we also talk about things like stock buybacks. And so as Stewart mentioned, that dialogue is ongoing.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I guess, lastly, I suppose it's kind of a rhetorical question, but the subject of actually having long-term guidance, is it reasonable to think you guys are giving this new consideration, kind of looking at it with a fresh set of eyes? Or is it just kind of on the larger list of things that you think about, but it's not necessarily at the top of the list?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, there's different ways to look at a list, but as Stewart mentioned, we think about guidance and look at it on a periodic basis, and we look at it not only from an earnings standpoint, but as you know, we provide guidance on cost of goods, and a number of other lines that help build our earnings results. And so we look at the components there too, and just to see whether or not there's some incremental help that we can give people, whether it's earnings or not. So we do consider it periodically.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from James Watson of HSBC.", "James Watson - HSBC Holdings plc", "First question was just, you guys had the, I guess, 50-plus percent International volume growth, but I guess a lot of that was Si\u2019hai. I'm wondering if you could break out what the sort of more organic growth rate was across the broad International segment, and just if there were any specific other countries with significant growth you could point out.", "David Dunnewald", "I'd say it's broadly half, layering in the Si'hai brands volume, and then the other half would be what you call, organic growth.", "James Watson - HSBC Holdings plc", "And were there any other countries where it was notable growth?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. I would highlight, China continues to grow strongly. I would say the introduction of Coors Light in Russia was a relatively small factor in that volume. It's all new volume, but it's very small, so that is not a driver of that number even in the organic piece that we talked about. Mexico has been a nice growth market for us recently as well. I think those are the ones that I'd highlight for you. I'm sorry, Spain. Spain's been a nice growth market for the Carling brand.", "James Watson - HSBC Holdings plc", "Have you given out what kind of size you have in Spain right now?", "David Dunnewald", "No. I would say in comparison to our main businesses, it's very small. And even relative to the overall international markets group, it's still relatively small. In other words, it's a lot smaller than China, for example.", "James Watson - HSBC Holdings plc", "And just switching tacks over to the pension expense, I was just wondering if you could help me figure out what the delta is between the pension expenses as they hit the income statement in 2010 versus what we'd expect to see hitting the income statement in 2011.", "David Dunnewald", "On the earlier call, we mentioned that 2011 expectation is around $60 million, at least currently. Things can change, but that's our view now, and then that was $17 million lower than 2010, and that includes the 42% of MillerCoors expense.", "James Watson - HSBC Holdings plc", "Is most of that going to come through the U.K. segment?", "David Dunnewald", "No. Well, most of the reduction or most of the actual expense?", "James Watson - HSBC Holdings plc", "Most of the reduction.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, you could attribute $25 million of reduction to the U.K., more than all of it. But we have a lot of different plans, so there's a little bit of movement here and there, but basically, it's all the U.K.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Walt Coleman [ph] of Decade Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "On all the COGS guidance that was provided, it was a little confusing because of the structural impacts that are going on both in Canada with the contract brewing, and then the U.K. with the Corona, et cetera. So I guess my question was x the structural impact, is there like gross margin pressure from COGS in Canada and the U.K.? I mean, I guess my question is because Canada COGS are flat, excluding the contract brewing, but with the contract brewing coming in at increasing mid-single digits, I mean is there also a revenue for hectoliter increase or the same, or it's just accounting? And then kind of the same question on the U.K. with the Corona stuff.", "David Dunnewald", "Two ways I'd look at that, I guess. One is on our own brand, and that's essentially taking out the structural piece you were talking about. So if you do that, Canada COGS, largely unchanged we said for 2011 that's per hectoliter. In the U.K., we said increase at a low-double digit rate, and now that's driven largely by -- let's see. Since we've -- layering in the Modelo brands, which increase both net sales and cost of goods. So if you take out the Modelo brand then you'd have a much lower increase in the U.K. from an owned brand standpoint. And then in the U.S. we said up slightly, and that's all in, no structural adjustment so to speak on that one. So that would get you to, call it, a modest increase for all three markets. So that's, I guess, one point of view, just on kind of on our own brand. And then if you layer in those structural pieces, then Canada goes to a mid-single digit rate, the U.K. actually drops to a low-single digit rate, and the U.S. stays where it is. If you net those out, I guess, you still end up somewhere in the low-single digits if you give us 42% of MillerCoors.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So like on the U.K. though, there isn't associated revenue increase along with the Modelo brand that would offset kind of the COGS increase?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, that would be the other part of your question, thank you. Those structural items, those do, in every case I can think of, they actually do drive net sales revenue per hectoliter up as well, not just cost of goods, or in the case of -- let's see, in the case of the U.K., they drive them down, because then you're layering on a component of NSR per factored brand and contract production. So, yes, in all cases that I can think of, they have both NSR and cost of goods impact in the business. And then to figure out whether that results in gross margin enhancement or compression, I'll leave that to you since we don't give earnings guidance. But if you're in the low-single digits, I mean, that's kind of where we ended up on an all-in basis without doing any careful math, compare that to your expectation for pricing. We've had relatively good pricing -- actually, in the fourth quarter, we had good pricing in all three of our major markets.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from Mark Swartzberg of Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I guess I wanted to understand more your comments about global MG&A in 2011. I guess, a, am I comparing numbers right? I'm looking at 2010 at $172 million, and now you're saying as much as $200 million for '11.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, does that sound good, Greg?", "Greg Snyder", "Yes.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, 172 up to around 200. And it's just Corporate and International, yes.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So $28 million for -- I guess, you called out China. It still seems like a pretty big number relative to your presence in China. So I guess, am I right in thinking that's all China? Or is there something else going on there?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, there is. These are investments, really, in a number of markets around the globe. So think about the existing Coors Light business in China. We've been ramping up spend behind that brand for some time. And it's getting to be a decent-sized brand in a relatively small slice of a large market, I guess, is the way I\u2019d put it, at the very top end of the market. So, anyway that would be a continuation of that trend. You also have essentially, layering on 100% of the Si'hai Brewing Company, not only marketing, but also overheads. And then, as I say, only half of that actually drops to the bottom line, the other half is taken out under the minority interest line in the consolidated income statement. And then you have other markets like Spain and Vietnam and Mexico and Russia, where we\u2019re spending -- we see very good growth opportunities. And it's important to mention that we'll also have Modelo in Japan, and that brand, which obviously, we want to make the most of that opportunity as well. So I think if you add all that up and I think that the other point that I wanted to make sure I made earlier was that as we make these investments, obviously, the goal is to sell more beer. And if you sell more beer, then you're going to be -- your operating income or loss line will look different from the MG&A line.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And this might continue on March 2, but it's interesting to see your International strategy from an internal perspective. I guess it's acquisitions, but anyhow, it's interesting to see your International strategy unfold here. Because you're really saying that '11's a big year for you guys internationally in terms of your own aim. So what kind of return do you think about getting on that kind of step up and spend, and what kind of timing are we talking about on that return? And I guess, are we going to get more of a focus on International on March 2?", "David Dunnewald", "The last question first. Yes, as always, we'll give you more strategic, maybe even tactical information related to the International group on March 2 in New York. As far as how long does it take to return, well, as with all of our investments, we have an expectation that over not too long, we're going to see a nice return from those investments. We expect all of our markets to get to a point of profitability, even the investment markets, over a reasonable time frame. That depends though on the, call it, the long-term potential of the market. And so there really isn't a one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how long are we willing to invest in a market like that before we get to, call it, pretax profit. And the other thing I'd say is, our international strategy really has two major components. One is, just what we talked about, in the International group, where we're investing in markets like China and Spain and Vietnam and Mexico. And at the same time, we look at opportunities to invest incremental cash in growth opportunities aside from the existing businesses, and that includes things like buying an interest in the China brewery and looking at other potential growth opportunities around the globe.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I'll wrap here, but if on March 2 -- the opportunity's exciting. There's a pretty long history, as you know, of brewers kind of falling pretty hard in some of the investments they've made in some of the markets you've cited, but you have a strong brand with Coors Light, for example. But anything you can do, on the 2nd, to say, our executives have been through some of those flops, our way of analysis is more rigorous in terms of returns, anything you can do to kind of allay concerns that your investors are going to see you spend the money and not get the return, would be great.", "David Dunnewald", "I not only understand, but appreciate the feedback, Mark.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions at this time, sir.", "David Dunnewald", "Okay. Great. Well, thank you, all, for joining us. Appreciate your interest in Molson Coors.

My name is Alicia, and I will be your conference Operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Molson Coors Brewing Company 2011 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, I want to paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Peter Swinburn", "Thank you, Alicia. Hello, and welcome, everybody, and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors' CFO; Tom Long, President and Chief Commercial Officer of MillerCoors; Gavin Hattersley, CFO of MillerCoors; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, President of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal Officer; Bill Waters, Molson Coors' Controller; Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.", "And for the last time, I can say we're also joined today by Leo Kiely, CEO of MillerCoors. In Leo's 18 years with the company, he has been on more than 70 of these earnings calls. So he has certainly more than paid his dues. We will miss Leo. But while thanking him for his great service to the company, we also welcome Tom Long to his new role and congratulate him on his appointment, effective June 1. So Leo, well done; and Tom, congratulations.", "On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2011 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspective of the balance of 2011. In the first quarter, our company increased underlying after-tax earnings by 17% and expanded margins significantly despite continuing challenges from weak industry volume and accelerating global commodity inflation. We faced particularly difficult volume comparisons in Canada, as we cycled last year's Vancouver Winter Olympics, but our volume trends in the U.S., U.K. and International improved versus recent quarters. Equally important, the strength of our brands drove positive pricing and net sales growth across our company. We've also continued to exceed our cost reduction goals, which provided resources to invest in our brands, grow earnings and generate cash. ", "Although the first quarter is a low season quarter for our core businesses in both profit and cash generation, these results reflect progress against the growth strategies we laid out for you 2 months ago during our annual Investor Day in New York. To remind you, in that meeting, we said our strategic growth focus would rest on 3 pillars: maximizing the profitable growth opportunities in our core markets, accelerating our push into new markets to grow our brands globally and looking for M&A opportunities that meet our criteria for generating shareholder value and that provide solid growth platforms for our business and brands.", "First, in our core markets. Our strategic focus has been on investing behind our brands, delivering value-enhancing innovation and effectively managing our cost structure in our mature markets. Our efforts to strengthen our brands and lead innovation in our markets have helped improve brand health, support positive pricing and generate a lot of excitement in the category. ", "Here are just some of the current examples. Coors Light has outperformed the competition in the past few years in both market share and average price. Our largest and most international brand grew at low single-digit rate globally in the first quarter. In the U.S., Miller Lite's portfolio performance continue to improve with this brand growing market share in the first quarter. ", "In Canada, Molson Canadian was up against a difficult comparison cycling the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, but we grew NSR per hectoliter across all markets, and we also launched Molson Canadian 67 into the Qu\u00e9bec market in the quarter. Early this year, we also signed our new National Hockey League sponsorship, under which Molson Canadian will have new opportunities to grow in Canada and expand in the U.S. Additionally, we expanded Molson M in Ontario to Western Canada and Keystone Lager to Ontario, while renewing the Molson Export brand with focus in Qu\u00e9bec. Overall, we have introduced more new products in Canada in the past 18 months than during the previous 15 years. ", "In the U.K., our recently strengthened portfolio gained overall market share for the second quarter in a row. And finally, we recently acquired the Sharp's Brewery, which produces Doom Bar, one of the UK's fastest growing cask ales. And these ales play at the top end of the category, similar to craft beers in the U.S. and Canada. ", "In our second growth pillar. Our International group has increased its investment rate behind Coors Light. Carling, and other brands -- sorry, Coors Light, Carling and other brands has been growing the top line at high rates in a select group of new markets. International business volume grew more than 45% in the first quarter, driven by the addition of Si'hai brands in China and growth of Coors Light in Latin America and China. This group is moving quickly and with purpose to what's becoming a significant contributor to total company top line and bottom line growth in 5 years or less.", "Turning to our final growth pillar. We look at M&A opportunities in 3 categories. First, small fill-in acquisitions in current markets to help build our portfolio and provide incremental top line growth. We've had a number of recent successes in this area over the past several years, including Creemore and Granville Island in Canada and Cobra in the U.K., all of which I might say are exceeding our initial expectations. Most recently, we completed the Sharp's acquisition in the first quarter, and after only a few months, results were already more positive than our original forecast. Second, we would invest selectively in international markets, as we did most recently with our new Si'hai JV in China. And that is also progressing well in these early days. And third, large scale M&A. ", "Regardless of the size or nature of the growth opportunity, we have a disciplined process around evaluating each of these, and we determine to make the very best use of every dollar of cash that we generate. ", "So with those highlights of our performance against our strategic growth pillars, I'll turn it over to Stewart to give first quarter financial highlights and the outlook for the balance of 2011. Stewart?", "S. Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter, and hello, everyone. I'll start with the first quarter financial highlights. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 1.5%, driven by industry volume, weakness in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. Nonetheless, the total company net sales increased 4.4% due to foreign currency movements along with positive pricing and sales mix. Net sales per hectoliter increased 6.6% in the quarter. In the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $81.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, was 17% higher than a year ago, driven by positive pricing and continued cost reductions this year. We grew operating and pretax margins in our U.S., U.K. and International businesses, which drove total company operating pretax and after-tax margin expansion of more than 100 basis points in the quarter. Delivering strong earnings growth in the face of substantial economic and industry headwinds bodes well for our ability to do even better when conditions improve. ", "It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings include some noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to 0 on a pretax basis. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the releases -- in the earnings release we distributed this morning. ", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada. Underlying pretax income decreased 3.2% to $54.4 million in the first quarter. Increased pricing, overhead reductions and favorable foreign currency were more than offset by mid-single-digit volume declines and input inflation. Due to weak industry conditions this year and cycling the 2010 Winter Olympics, our Canada sales to retail, or STRs, for the first quarter decreased 6.9%.  This represents a market share decline of approximately 0.5 point from a year ago, which was gained by smaller brewers primarily through increased price discounting. ", "Net sales per hectoliter increased 1.8% in local currency due to continued positive pricing. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 3.1% in local currency, driven -- largely driven by higher commodity fuel and distribution costs as well as fixed cost deleveraging from lower volumes. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased in the quarter due to lower overhead expenses and the release of an indirect tax reserve.", "Moving to our U.S. segment. Underlying pretax income increased 7.6% to $101.8 million in the first quarter, driven by continued positive pricing, favorable brand mix, strong cost management and the receipt of a onetime payment by MillerCoors. Domestic STRs decreased 1.4% in the quarter. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter from MillerCoors, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 2.1% in the quarter. Meanwhile, cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.2%, higher freight and fuel inflation partially offset by cost reductions. MG&A expenses decreased 1.3% due to a onetime payment from a third party. ", "In our U.K. business. First quarter underlying pretax income more than doubled to $4.6 million, driven by a decrease in defined-benefit pension expense and higher pricing, partly offset by lower volumes and higher cost of goods sold. Although the British pound appreciated 4% against the U.S. dollar, this had no significant effect on pretax earnings. STRs decreased 1.6%, which is better than the 4% decline for the industry, implying a slight market share gain for our U.K. business. ", "Owned brand net sales per hectoliter increased 10% in local currency, driven by positive pricing and sales mix in the quarter, especially the addition of the Modelo brands. Owned brand cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 13% in local currency, with 2/3 of the change due to the addition of the Modelo brands, along with higher cost channel mix, fixed-cost deleverage and input inflation. Meanwhile, marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. were unchanged in local currency. ", "The International and Corporate segment posted an underlying loss of $62.3 million pretax in the first quarter, 5.3% less than a year ago. This improvement was due to a $5.8 million decrease in corporate expense, partially offset by $2.3 million higher spending to accelerate International growth. ", "Now beyond operating and profit performance. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $2 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.1 billion, resulting in net debt of $0.9 billion. Our cash balances were $136 million lower than at year-end because we are in our seasonal cash-use time of the year. ", "Looking forward, we have not changed our 2011 guidance for effective tax rate, total company spending or for MG&A expenses in the Corporate and International market segments. Refer to our last earnings call for our last guidance regarding these metrics.", "In terms of revised guidance, we now expect full year corporate interest expense to be approximately $115 million based on current foreign exchange rates, down from $120 million on our last earnings call. With regard to cash uses, we now anticipate cash distributions to our defined-benefit pension plans of about $60 million this year, including our portion of MillerCoors in Canada JV contributions.", "In the area of cost outlook by business. In Canada, we now expect our full year 2011 owned brand cost of goods sold per hectoliter excluding the cost of contract brewing to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, driven by commodity inflation and fixed-cost deleverage related to lower volume, particularly in the first quarter. Including the effect of our contract brewing arrangement with North American Breweries, we still expect cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in local currency. Note that this contract brewing arrangement will also increase net sales per hectoliter this year.", "In the U.K., we now expect 2011 all in cost of goods per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single-digit rate in local currency. Excluding the impact of factored brands and contract production of other brewers' products, neither of which are included in our beer volumes, we expect our 2011 owned-brand cost of goods per hectoliter to increase at a low double-digit rate in local currency. This increase is driven by product mix related to adding the Modelo brands, which increased both net sales and cost of goods sold per hectoliter and are treated by us as owned brands. Other drivers include input cost inflation, offset by cost savings and lower pension costs.", "In the U.S., we now expect MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate in 2011 due to significant recent increases in freight and fuel costs. In all of our businesses, we hedge a significant portion of our commodity inputs, generally over a 1- to 3-year range to reduce the commodity volatility on our financial results in the short term. Nonetheless, we expect significant cost challenges this year from volatility in freight, fuel and the unhedged portion of our commodity inputs.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, a wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter Swinburn", "Thanks, Stewart. So by way of regional outlook. In Canada, we're leveraging our new product launches by expanding Molson M into Ontario and the western provinces to complete a national footprint to this successful brand, and we also completed the national rollout of Molson Canadian 67 by introducing this brand into Qu\u00e9bec. In our endeavor to continue to own the low-calorie beer segment, last month, we launched a new flavor variant, Molson Canadian 67 Sublime, which delivers a refreshing twist of lemon and lime flavor while still leveraging our low-calorie platform. We also expanded Keystone Lager into Ontario this year based on the success this brand has enjoyed since last year's launch in the western provinces. ", "We continue to develop and introduce innovative ways to drive consumer relevance and excitement behind Coors Light and our Molson brands. In particular, we are partnering with the NHL to provide Molson Canadian with new and exciting growth opportunities across North America. From an operations perspective, we expect Canada financial results to benefit from the ramp-up of the NAB contract brewing arrangements in the balance of this year, which also helps mitigate the increasing inflationary pressure on our cost base. ", "In the U.S., as we move into the key summer selling season, we will continue our keen focus on premium lights and crafts and imports. Execution and distribution will continue to be major focus areas for 2011, and we will invest heavily behind our programs, including multicultural outreach. We also remained focused on core brand innovations.", "This summer, we will launch Coors Light Super Cold Activation packaging, which lets customer know when the beer is not just cold but super cold.  Miller Lite will continue its taste positioning by asking consumers to \"Man Up\" with new TV spots being placed during prime sports programs. We will have a strong focus on Hispanic soccer with Miller Lite's sponsorship of the Gold Cup tournament and the introduction of the Chivas' Mexican Team sponsorship. You'll also see more excitement around MGD 64 this summer with MGD 64 Lemonade.", "We will continue to drive Craft and Import growth through Tenth and Blake. We expect to see continued growth in the seasonal release of Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy. Later this month, the brand will launch a summer sampler can pack, making Tenth and Blake the first major craft brewer to launch a variety pack in cans, and we will continue to increase Blue Moon momentum with additional television and focus on seasonals.", "In the U.K., the team continues to make substantial progress in improving underlying profitability to our value-add-to-volume strategy. During the first quarter, we grew market share slightly while achieving pricing growth. Our agreement to distribute Corona and other Modelo brands became fully operational in the first quarter, and we commenced distribution of brands from our recently acquired Sharp's Brewery. Along with brand building and innovation work on our current portfolio, we expect the addition of the Modelo and Sharp brands to help us drive improved volume and market share gains in the U.K.", "In the second quarter, U.K. volume and earnings comparisons will be challenging due to the cycling of the FIFA World Cup in 2010, which drove industry volumes plus 13% and our U.K. volumes plus 17% in the month of June. Following the World Cup, industry volumes declined 16% in July of last year, which will make for easier year-on-year comparisons in the third quarter of this year. ", "Our International business -- in our International business, we continue to invest in new markets to drive top- and bottom-line growth, so that this business can be a significant driver of Molson Coors' growth in 5 years or less. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect incremental 2011 investments across several markets to total approximately $25 million to $30 million on the MG&A line, including adding the Modelo brands in Japan and the joint venture in China to our results. Our expectation is that these new investments, as a group, will be offset by volume and gross profit increases in 2011.  ", "Following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses in the second quarter.  In Canada, our sales to retail for the 4 weeks ended April 23 decreased slightly. For the same, in the U.S. -- sorry, for the same 4-week period, our U.K. STRs have increased at a low single-digit rate due to the benefit of Easter holiday timing this year. In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended April 23, MillerCoors STRs declined up to mid-single-digit rates. During this period, our market share, measured in Nielsen scanner data, continue to be positive. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a small portion of the second quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "To summarize our discussion today, our first quarter results reflect solid net sales, earnings growth and margin expansion despite sluggish economies in our core markets and accelerating global commodity inflation. Our financial performance in the quarter benefited from strong trends supported by substantial investment in innovation, continued positive pricing and cost reductions. These results reflect progress against our 3 growth pillars of maximizing the value of our core markets, increasing our exposure to emerging markets and taking advantage of smart M&A opportunities.", "Our group's strategy is generating value for the business today and will have an even greater impact as economic conditions improve. At Molson Coors, we have a strong team focused on growing this business, realizing our vision of becoming the top global brewer in profitability and delivering long-term value to our shareholders.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear by webcast on our website. ", "So at this point, Alicia, we would like to open it up to you for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So I guess in terms of the Canadian market, because it sounds like Q1 volume trend was pretty weak, understand that there's the Olympic comparisons. But can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of the industry trends and in Q1? And then it looks like you saw a pickup in April with your STR down only slightly, so maybe just give us a little bit of color in terms of what, then, drove the improvement in April versus Q1.", "David Perkins", "Judy, it's Dave Perkins. Thanks for the question. So Q1 was heavily impacted by cycling the Olympics, as you mentioned, from last year, and we're continuing to feel economic pressures. I think including the increasing gas prices that we've seen over the last few months, we haven't had particularly good weather to date in Canada. I think that's an impact as well. But really, the 2 factors is cycling the Olympics and the economic pressures. It's tough to give you a much color on April than we have some benefit from Easter timing, but we've also got the offset of what has continued to be quite weak weather. And so we also don't have insight into industry volume relative to share. But certainly, we're feeling better about what we're seeing in April than that we saw in the first quarter.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Dave, can you just maybe give us a little bit of your perspective just in terms of, then, your market share performance in light of the competition from some of the smaller brands? What are you doing to basically regain some of that market share back? Are you seeing heightened competitive activity from some of those smaller brands as you got into the second quarter as well?", "David Perkins", "Yes. Well, the context there, Judy, over the last 18 months, as you know, we've been focused on strengthening our portfolio, and we've had programs behind our core brands to renew those. We've had a pretty aggressive innovation agenda, and we invested to become price competitive in the market. As a result of that, we saw strong share growth last year that we felt very good about. Over the last 3 quarters, we've been flexing the strength of that portfolio to restore our revenue growth. And what we've seen in the first quarter is quite encouraging in the sense that we saw about 3% increase through pricing, which helped offset about one point of mix headwinds for us. So that felt good. There's no question that where we increased our NSR per hectoliter, we did see some share decline to the smaller national and regional brewers who appear to have stepped up their discounting. So as we go forward, we'll -- we're going to have our continued aggression behind innovation, behind our core brand renewal. And we'll continue to watch the price and volume balance to ensure that we're allowing our strategic brands to deliver what they need to deliver for us.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just broadly speaking on the cost side of the business, I guess the freight and fuel cost have been pretty volatile here. Stewart, is there any way you can give us some perspective on how much of your costs are covered or hedged? And how much of the sort of freight and fuel cost volatility could impact your low single-digit, I guess, underlying cost guidance for MillerCoors and then, I guess, mid single-digits for Canada?", "S. Glendinning", "Yes. So, Judy, we really don't, for competitive reasons, give out a great amount of detail on our hedging. I mean, as I've shared in the past, these hedging programs obviously have a lot more hedged in the more immediate periods than in the later periods and do basically span a period of years. We take into account our -- the current cost situation and what we're seeing in commodity pricing in terms of giving you that guidance. And that's the reason we give the guidance is to just try to make that a little bit easier for you. So for the moment, I would rely on that. And to the extent that we see any changes, then we'll update you next quarter. I will say that if you just look at where commodities are currently, they're pretty high prices relative to what, perhaps, we've seen in the last 12 months. And so you have to expect a lot more increase in order to see those -- that inflation number moving around.", "David Perkins", "And, Judy, can I just clarify the number you quoted for Canada COGS, you said mid-single digit. Just recognize that is with the NAB impact factored into that.  What we're in fact seeing is low single-digit without the NAB impact in there.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And you also, Dave, talked about the NAB benefit that you will get as the year progresses, which sounds like maybe the -- you get some offset on the cost on the margin side.", "David Perkins", "Yes. I mean, there's 2 impacts from NAB, one will be some volume leverage benefit, and the other will be a margin benefit, income benefit.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank", "Just to make sure I fully understand the STRs in North America, so it's your number till 4/23, there may or may not be a little bit of Easter effect in there?  Easter, I guess, obviously being the day afterwards. Could we assume it's mostly covered in that?", "David Perkins", "Yes, in the case of Canada, through to April 23, there would be some Easter benefit in there. Easter in Canada we don't estimate to be a huge beer event or beer occasion, but it does have some impact.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank", "Got it. Also, just sticking with Canada, because last year with the Olympics, you were also the official sponsor and such. Can you maybe say that the share loss this quarter versus what last year looked like, is that perhaps maybe the share gains were artificially high last year?", "David Perkins", "Well, in the first quarter of last year, I believe, we gained about a 0.5 share point, which is similar to what we've given up this quarter. Certainly, we would've had some share benefit last year from our position within the Olympics. But I think there are the 2 factors that play into this, one is the Olympic effect, and the other is on increased discounting, what appears to be increased discounting by the smaller brewers. And I think they both play into this. And if you ask me to weight them, I'd put a higher weight on the pricing strategy or the pricing that we're seeing from the smaller brewers.", "Kaumil Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank", "Got it. And in those western provinces, are there any legal minimums or such that we're close to?", "David Perkins", "There are minimum prices in 3 of the western provinces, and there are brands at those legal minimums. The mainstream brands, Molson Canadian, Coors Light, would tend to be quite a bit above those minimum prices.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "Tom, I was hoping you could give us a bit of an overview of the U.S. business and just your perspective on if we should see some tweaks and strategy here with your leadership of the business and what the key areas you'll be focused on going forward.", "Tom Long", "Yes, thanks. We have put in a really firm foundation for our company here. And our focus on organic growth that we outlined to our entire system, including our distributors recently, is a focus of our strategy going forward. So fundamentally, our job is to keep driving brand equity in the marketplace, drive cost management and drive forward to organic growth, as we stated. So I wouldn't plan to make fundamental changes in that. We just look to accelerate our capability to deliver.", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "And Dave, I wanted to turn back to Canada for a minute. Can you just give us an update on if you're expecting to gain market share in Canada this full year? Is it realistic given the Q1 share loss and the robust innovation contribution from last year as well as the discounting from the smaller brewers?", "David Perkins", "Yes. Well, obviously, couldn't give guidance on what I think our share will be. What I would say is we're very much focused on continuing to build the strength of our portfolio. I like our innovation program coming up for the summer. As Peter talked about, Molson M has gone into Ontario and the west, Canadian 67 into Qu\u00e9bec. We've got 2 new flavored entries with 67 Sublime and Miller Chill Lemon and a little bit beyond that, that we'll be putting into the market. So I feel good about what's going in. Some interesting programming behind Molson Canadian for the summer as well, which I think consumers will respond well to.", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "And are you expecting the innovation contribution to be less in 2011 than it was in 2010?", "David Perkins", "We're continuing to see innovation delivering in between 2 and 3 share points in our business, and so it feels like a good, solid contribution. I have not seen that tailing off at all.", "Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley", "And then just on the pricing front, you obviously indicated that some of the smaller brewers are discounting more aggressively. What are you seeing from your main competitor in the marketplace?  And maybe if you could just give us a bit of a review on pricing by region?", "David Perkins", "Well, I think that the major difference I see in the environment relative to before is really what I commented on, on the smaller brewers. I think the pricing environment, generally, is quite stable, with that exception. And we've seen some selective price increases and general price increases go through in various markets and seem to be sticking.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christine Farkas with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "If I could start with a couple of questions for Mark. In the U.K., can you tell us, either for the quarter or perhaps for the year, how much you expect the Modelo and Sharp's brands will add to your volume?", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Christine, yes. All other things being equal, we would expect about one share point. Obviously, you got a net from the reduction in the same-store brands which the Modelo brands replaced. But a gross level, about a share point overall.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, share point in the marketplace versus points to your volume growth, correct?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And then sticking with the U.K., there was a comment in the press release that suggested the British pound appreciation did not impact the pretax for the segment. Can you just tell us why that is?", "Peter Swinburn", "Stewart, you want to take that up?", "S. Glendinning", "Yes. I mean, the answer is that there's a 4% appreciation, but the earnings for the quarter are so small that it's not material. It's not worth really flagging.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "So it's not that there's was an offset on some other line, okay. And just moving to Canada, Dave, you talked about the -- what I understand to be the full rate, or frontline rate, up 3% offset by about a point of mix. The press release indicated 3% on key brands, but your whole portfolio saw, in aggregate, 3 points of rate increase?", "David Perkins", "In aggregate, yes, NSR per hectoliter was up 3%, offset by a point of mix headwind. And just give you the clarification that in that increase, there's reduction in dealing back or special offers to the consumers as well. So it's a combination of some frontline price increases, general price increases and reduced deal back.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And your comments about price increases going through in selected markets.  Was that a first quarter comment or pricing since your first quarter has been reported, since the end of your first quarter?", "David Perkins", "There are 2 provinces in which we saw change in the first quarter. And one that has gone through in -- since the beginning of the second quarter.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And roughly, while we don't know what would be dealt back or how the environment looks, what kind of price increases are you seeing?", "David Perkins", "Well, for instance, in Qu\u00e9bec, at the beginning of April, the minimum price would have gone up about 1.8%, in line with the CPI. And in the west, the increases tend to be in line with CPI as well.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then in Canada as well, there was a help to the MG&A line that was described as a release of an indirect tax reserve. Is that a onetime? Does that reverse later, or can you quantify perhaps how much that helps Canada?", "David Perkins", "Yes, it's not an ongoing benefit. So it was in the quarter, and it was -- it accounts for about 2/3 of the favorability that you've seen on our MG&A for the quarter.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Lastly, Peter for you. There was a mention about a small impact from the total return swap on Foster's. I thought maybe -- I was under the impression that was no longer a factor. Can you just help us out what's left or what's on your accounting statements regarding that swap?", "Peter Swinburn", "Sure. I'll delegate that one to Stewart, because he'll you give you the correct answer, Christine.", "S. Glendinning", "Christine, just so -- we finally settled the swap. Last year, we reentered into a number of instruments to try to lock out some of the gain, and the final settlements took place in the first quarter. And that's what you're seeing here flowing through the numbers.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so we won't see anything going forward?", "Gavin Hattersley", "No, you will not. That swap is now gone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.", "John Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Want to follow up on the Canada trends a little bit. If we take a look at the first half of last year in realizing there was a benefit from the Olympics, even so, the 2-year stacked run rate on STRs -- or not the run rate, but the 2-year stack total, you showed volume growth on a 2-year basis. The last couple of quarters, volume is down on a 2-year basis, and this quarter, it was basically in line with the back half of the year. So adjusting for the comps, it looks as though the last 9 months have been weaker. Can you talk a little bit -- are you seeing -- is this just the continued economic stuff? Was it just the new products were so much more successful in the first half of last year? I'm trying to figure out why that 2-year trend has decelerated and kind of when you think, from your perspective, that can get back to positive?", "David Perkins", "And, John, you're talking about the industry category volume, right?", "John Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Well, yes. I mean, I think it actually works out the same for you guys or the industry from that standpoint. I'm not sure it really makes a dramatic difference one way or the other.", "David Perkins", "Okay. Let me just comment, then, on the category trend. If you take out the Olympic quarters of Q1 of 2010, generally what we've been seeing in the surrounding quarters is volume decline in the 1.5% to 2% range. And so without any abnormal quarters, that's what we seem to be seeing. We believe that the bulk of that is economic circumstances. And as to when that will improve, I mean, it's impossible to say. We just -- we get our portfolio into shape, but when that does improve, we'll be a big beneficiary of it.", "John Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And it does, I guess -- it wasn't just the first quarter last year, though, it's also the second quarter. So again, do you think maybe that was just, again, that extra new product activity that drove it?", "David Perkins", "Yes, I think there was a couple of factors. One is there were some larger pack sizes that were being marketed in certain provinces like Ontario, 28-packs that were quite aggressively sold, and we think that did have some benefit to industry volume. Weather last year through the summer was quite incredible here, which probably also had some impact. So there's a lot of noise in what's going on in the industry, but I think the underlying trend that we're feeling appears to be economic factors.", "Peter Swinburn", "John, this is Peter Swinburn. Just to expand on a little bit. If you try and track it a bit further back and look at the trends across the whole of North America, then volume trends in Canada and the U.S. fell off around about the same time and tracked each other. The first quarter of last year and the second quarter of last year were, I won't say aberrations, but they certainly were where the trends separated to the benefit of Canada. But then the Canadian trends got back in line with the overall American trends. So it just looked like the overall North American trend is pretty similar, but for some reasons, the first and second quarter -- obviously, the first quarter because of Olympics, but first and second quarter of last year in Canada were, for some reason, more beneficial.", "John Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Got it. So a little less decoupling now is probably the right way to look at it?", "Peter Swinburn", "Exactly.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of James Watson with HSBC.", "James Watson - HSBC", "A couple of quick follow-ups on Canada. Just if you could give a little more color on the negative sales mix in the quarter. I just wanted to know where that came from and if that was related to the share loss to the smaller competitors, which I -- although I assume that would be in the low end of the market.", "David Perkins", "The mix impact that we saw, James, was really the launch of Keystone, Keystone Light last year, and so it's the impact of that in our mix. As we strengthened our position in the value segment of the business, we've had that mix impact.", "James Watson - HSBC", "And across Canada, are you seeing a difference in the volume growth trends between the high end, the mainstream and the low end?", "David Perkins", "Yes. I mean, the value category performance does vary. The absolute size of the category, the penetration of the category varies. It is higher in the west than it is in the balance of the country. It's lower in Qu\u00e9bec because so much beer is sold at minimum price there. The growth trends that we see would tend to be higher in the west and, again, lower in Qu\u00e9bec, Ontario and the middle.", "James Watson - HSBC", "And just on -- in the U.K., I was wondering if you could just talk about the performance, if we stripped out the addition of Modelo and the reduced pension expense in the quarter, how the U.K.'s performance would have compared to last year.", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Jim. When you say the U.K. performance, at what level, on which metric?", "James Watson - HSBC", "Operating income.", "Mark Hunter", "On an operating income level, the benefit from pensions has given us a swing of about GBP 4 million in the quarter. So we called out the 2-year benefit in New York and what we're seeing is that phase-through in a quarterly basis.", "James Watson - HSBC", "And Modelo didn't trickle down to the bottom line in a...", "S. Glendinning", "It would, James, but we wouldn't comment on that specifically.", "James Watson - HSBC", "And just a question, broader question on pricing in the U.K. I mean, you guys were up, excluding Modelo, about 5% it looked like this quarter, and that was coming off of a large increase in 1Q10 and even before that. Just how are you guys getting these large increases in pricing? Like, where is it coming from, and how sustainable is that over the long term to keep taking this sort of large price increases?", "Mark Hunter", "What we've seen, James, is we said it very clearly our value-ahead-of-volume strategy just about 3 years ago because of the downward pressure on industry volumes, we've now had actually 17 consecutive quarters of pricing growth. And that's fundamentally been around the quality of our negotiations with our major customers and our own -- the quality of our promotional plans that we're developing with our customers. So I don't think you will see, going forward, the kind of double-digit pricing increases that we've seen over the last couple of years. But clearly, driving value in our market, which continues to slide in volume, is a key priority for us as an organization as we continue also to manage our costs very effectively in the business.", "James Watson - HSBC", "Have the competitors followed at the same level of price increases, or has there been a big change in the price gap?", "Mark Hunter", "At retail, there's been very little change. Our pricing that we're commenting on clearly is our NSR, our cost pricing into our customers. And I can't comment on what our competitors have been doing or not doing in that area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "A few questions on the COGS you had, Stewart. I guess, firstly, your expectation for COGS increases has come up versus where it was when you reported the fourth quarter, but it doesn't look like it's come up all that much. Do you think that's a function of the hedges you've got in place or more a function of simply the basket of your commodities? And then I had a follow-up.", "S. Glendinning", "Yes, it's really a function of the hedges, Mark. Obviously, our cost programs are offsetting, but they would've been there already.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So in other words, hedges rolling off, COGS staying where we are, we're going to see probably an accelerating increase come '12?", "S. Glendinning", "You got to remember that our hedging program is a rolling program. It will depend on where pricing is. I mean, we saw very rapid rise in the price of fuel. That could just as easily go the other way. I think if you look at metal's prices over the last couple of years, there's been tremendous volatility there. So I don't know where price is going to go next year, but what I do know is that our hedging program is beneficial from the perspective that it smooths those changes over time.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And then glass, specifically, looks like there's some shortages there. How are you seeing your glass costs today versus when you reported fourth quarter? Is that shortage affecting your cost there? What's going on with that component of your cost?", "S. Glendinning", "No, Mark, we haven't seen any dramatic impact on our business from any glass shortages. And we certainly haven't broken our -- we don't breakout our COGS publicly like that. But I can just tell you that with respect to glass, we haven't seen a major impact from any shortages.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And availability of supply on glass, how do you feel about that versus rest of the year?", "S. Glendinning", "We feel very positive.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Peter Swinburn", "Okay. Thank you very much, Alicia, and thank you, everybody, for your interest in the company. We look forward to speaking to you again at the end of the next quarter.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's conference call.

My name is Michelle and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Molson Coors Brewing Company 2011 Second Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, I want to paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language.", "Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Peter Swinburn", "Thank you, Michelle. Hello, welcome, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. So with me on the call this morning are Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, President of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal Officer; Bill Waters, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors VP of Investor Relations.", "On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will take you through highlights of our second quarter 2011 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of 2011. ", "In the second quarter, our company underlying after-tax earnings decreased about 1% as positive beer pricing and cost reductions in our core businesses and favorable foreign exchange were offset by the impact of weak economic conditions, commodity inflation and investments in our International businesses.", "As we mentioned during our annual New York Investor Day in March, our growth strategies rest on 3 pillars: Maximizing the profitable growth opportunities in our core markets; accelerating our push into new and emerging markets to grow our brands globally; and looking for M&A opportunities that meet our criteria for generating shareholder value.", "We can [indiscernible] with our results for our core markets, we faced challenges in 2 main fronts in the second quarter. Volumes for the industry on our businesses were weak due to struggling economies, high unemployment among our core demographic base and high fuel prices. Our Canada and U.K. businesses cycled particularly difficult volume comparisons from a year ago, which negatively impacted results this year.", "Input inflation, including fuel, packaging materials and agricultural commodities has driven our 2011 cost of goods per hectoliter forecast in all of our businesses higher than we anticipated just 6 months ago. Our hedging strategies have lessened, but not eliminated the impact of this inflation.", "At the same time, we have continued to invest behind our brands and innovation, and in the U.S., Blue Moon and Leinenkugel grew double digits and led the growth of the craft category, while Coors Light grew both volume and market share.", "In Canada, we introduced Molson Canadian 67 Sublime, Miller Chill Lemon and Rickard's Blonde. And in the U.K., we grew market share for the third consecutive quarter. After successfully implementing an SAP system in the first half of this year, the U.K. team plans in the second half include a number of new brand introductions, a new beer to appeal to women and the rebranding of Carling.", "Our international group has increased its investment rate behind Coors Light, Carling and other brands, and has been growing the top line at high rates in a group of priority new and emerging markets.", "International business volume was 54% higher in the second quarter, driven by the addition of the Si'hai brands in China and the Modelo brands in Japan, along with growth of Carling in Europe and Coors Light in Latin America and China. In the quarter, we completed the purchase of a controlling interest in a new joint venture to brewing market the Cobra brand in Southeast Asia, including India. This $35 million investment represents a very attractive way to enter one of the world's most fastest-growing markets and gives us global control of the high opportunity Cobra brand.", "We also introduced the Carling brand in the Ukraine this quarter, and initial results are very positive. ", "As we mentioned in New York in March, our international group is increasing investments in high potential markets with the goal of becoming a significant contributor to total company top line and bottom line growth in less than 5 years.", "The primary focus of the international team for the short and medium term is on making the recent brand and market launches successful.", "We will also continue to look for M&A opportunities that fit our financial criteria. Besides the Cobra business in South Asia, other recent examples include the Sharp's Brewery in the U.K. early this year and Granville Island Brewery in Canada last year. During the past several years, we have used our cash not only for growth opportunities, but also to continue to strengthen the company's balance sheet and to double our dividends per share.", "The combination of strong cash generation and substantial cash balances now gives us the opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through a stock repurchase program, which we introduced this morning with our second quarter earnings.", "Our board has approved a program to repurchase up to $1.2 billion of the company's class B common shares, which we expect to implement over a period of the next 3 years. This new stock buyback program reflects our continued confidence in the long-term growth and cash generating potential of our company.", "In a few minutes, Stew will provide additional details regarding our capital allocation priorities.", "So with those highlights of our strategic growth pillars and the new share repurchase program, I'll turn it over to Stewart to give second quarter financial highlights. Stewart, over to you.", "S. Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. In second quarter financial highlights, Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors declined 2.8%, driven by continued industry volume weakness in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. Nonetheless, total company net sales increased 5.7% due to foreign currency movements, along with higher pricing and positive sales mix and international growth. Net sales per hectoliter increased 8.9% in the quarter.", "On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $231.6 million or $1.23 per diluted share was 1.2% lower than a year ago, driven by lower sales volumes, higher commodity inflation and investments in our international businesses, largely offset by positive pricing, continued cost reductions and favorable foreign currency movements. It is important to note that our second quarter underlying earnings excludes some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses, the net to an $11.3 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning.", "In segment performance highlights, starting with Canada. Underlying pretax income decreased 4.5% to $139.9 million. Increased pricing, MG&A reductions and favorable foreign currency were more than offset by mid-single-digit volume declines and the resulting fixed cost deleverage. These results included $5 million benefit from a 6% year-over-year increase in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar.", "Sales-to-retail or STRs declined 4.2% in the second quarter due to continued industry weakness and competitive price discounting in key regions.", "Our market share declined approximately 3/4 of a point from a year ago, which was partially, driven by a challenging comparison versus the second quarter last year, when we grew market share more than 1.5 points. Net sales per hectoliter increased 2.2% in local currency due equally to continued positive pricing and the addition of North American Breweries contract brewing sales.", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 7.7% in local currency, driven largely by the impacts of fixed cost deleveraging from lower volumes, input inflation, sales mix and the cost of brewing beer under our NAB contract. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased in the quarter due largely to lower overhead expenses.", "Moving to our U.S. segment. Underlying pretax income increased 5.6% to $172.2 million in the second quarter, driven by continued positive pricing, favorable brand mix and strong cost management. Domestic STRs decreased 2.7% in the quarter. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter from MillerCoors, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, increased 2.9% in the quarter. Meanwhile, cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.3%, with higher freight, fuel and packaging inflation partially offset by cost reductions.", "MG&A expenses increased 0.4% due to higher information systems expense, partially offset by cost savings.", "In our U.K. business second quarter underlying pretax income increased 6.1% to $34.7 million, driven by a temporary reduction in marketing spending, a decrease in defined-benefit pension expense and favorable foreign exchange, partially offset by lower volumes as a result of cycling the FIFA World Cup in 2010. The British pound appreciated 9% versus the U.S. dollar, which improved pretax earnings by approximately $3 million.", "STRs decreased 5.7% due to cycling the World Cup in June 2010. This compares to a 10% decline for the U.K. industry, yielding a market share increase, the third consecutive quarterly share gain for our U.K. business.", "Owned-brand net sales per hectoliter increased 7% in local currency, driven by the impact of positive sales mix in the quarter, especially the addition of the Modelo brands. Owned-brand cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 16% in local currency, with nearly all of the change due to sales mix, which was predominantly related to the addition of the Modelo brands. Other drivers include input inflation and fixed cost deleverage from lower volumes. Meanwhile, marketing, general and administrative expenses in the U.K. declined 7% in local currency due to lower marketing and pension expense, partially offset by higher sales force and information systems costs.", "The International and Corporate segment posted an underlying loss of $67 million pretax in the second quarter, 16% more than a year ago. This increase was primarily due to higher investments in our International businesses and brands, along with a $2 million increase in corporate net interest expense. Approximately 1/4 of the $10 million loss in the International businesses in the quarter was driven by quarterly time differences, as well as the integration costs relating to the new Cobra joint venture in India.", "Equally important, the International business grew volume 54% and contributed nearly 15% of total company net sales growth in the second quarter.", "Underlying free cash flow for the first half of this year was $122 million, which was made up of $272 million of operating cash flow, plus $15 million of proceeds from the Foster swapping line and $1 million from asset sales, minus $72 million of capital spending and $94 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.", "Note that MillerCoors also provided $273 million of operating cash in the first half, yielding net pretax free cash flow of $179 million in the first half.", "This $201 million reduction from last year was primarily driven by the timing of working capital and lower cash provided by MillerCoors this year. Our 2011 underlying free cash flow goal remains $750 million, plus or minus 10%. Please see our website for details regarding our adjustments to arrive at underlying free cash flow.", "Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $2 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.2 billion, resulting in net debt of $0.8 billion. ", "Looking forward, we have not changed our 2011 guidance for total company and capital spending, pension contributions, corporate interest expense or MG&A expense in the Corporate and International segment. Refer to our February and May earnings calls for our most recent guidance regarding these metrics.", "We are revising our outlook for the company's 2011 effective tax rate to a range of 15% to 19%, which is 2 percentage points lower than our outlook at the beginning of the year. ", "Turning to cash use, we have been consistent in saying that our priorities for allocating capital will be in 3 areas. Growth opportunities, strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders. First, in growth opportunities, Peter reviewed our growth strategies earlier and highlighted some of the transactions and brand investments we've made recently.", "Other examples of reinvesting in our business include high return investments in facilities, systems and capabilities, such as the new high-speed can line we're installing in our Montreal brewery this year and a series of planned supply chain improvements in the U.K. over the next few years.", "These are return-driven investments that also support our brand and innovation strategies.", "Second, our balance sheet is much stronger now after paying down substantial debt and pension liabilities in recent years, and our leverage ratios are in a comfortable range. One specific balance sheet question that we will resolve in the next year relates to the cross-currency swaps that are now about $440 million out of the money and maturing in May 2012. We likely will address this upcoming maturity through a combination of settlement and extension. ", "Third, in returning cash to shareholders, Peter mentioned that we have doubled our dividend per share over the last 4 years with significant, current cash balances and strong prospects for cash generation in the years ahead. A stock buyback program also makes sense.", "This morning, we announced our board approval of a $1.2 billion stock repurchase program, which we plan to implement over the next 3 years. We will manage this program opportunistically with the primary goal of growing long-term shareholder value.", "We are pleased to be in a strong position to increase cash returns to Molson Coors shareholders while preserving financial flexibility to explore growth opportunities and strengthen our balance sheet in the future.", "As we consider opportunities and circumstances change over time, we will continue to monitor and pursue the best returns for our shareholders, and this may impact our capital allocation priority. As always, all potential cash uses will be bettered by our disciplined process and must meet our firm criteria of providing a clear view to near-term earnings accretion and building long-term value and shareholder value.", "In the area of cost outlook, each of our businesses continues to face significant challenges from high unemployment and fuel costs. ", "Looking ahead by business. In Canada, we now expect our 2011 owned-brand cost of goods sold to increase at a mid-single-digit per hectoliter in local currency. We also expect Canada all-in COGS, which includes the cost of contract brewing, to increase at a mid-single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency.", "In the third quarter, we will be cycling a non-recurring reduction in costs that we called out a year ago.", "In the U.K., we still expect our full year owned-brand COGS per hectoliter, including the impact of active brands and contract brewing, to grow at a low double-digit rate in local currency. This increase is driven by the addition of the Modelo brands, which we treat as owned brands in the U.K.  We expect all-in U.K. COGS to increase at a mid-single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency.", "In the U.S., we continue to expect MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate in 2011, largely due to significant recent increases in freight and fuel costs. In all our businesses, we hedge a portion of our commodity inputs generally over a 1-to 3-year range to reduce the impact of commodity volatility on our financial results in the short term.", "Nonetheless, we expect significant cost challenges this year from volatility in freight, fuel and the unhedged portion of our commodity inputs. ", "In our core markets, we are evaluating our pricing in order to take into account growing input inflation.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter Swinburn", "Thank you, Stewart. So by way of regional outlook, in Canada, having now cycled last year's Winter Olympics and several new brand launches, we anticipate easier volume comparisons in the second half of this year. More important, our brand portfolio is the strongest it has been in many years, and we continue to build on this strength. We are investing behind our recent brand expansions, while continuing to drive consumer relevance for Coors Light and Molson Canadian through successful programming, such as our Red Leaf campaign.", "In the U.S., we continue our keen focus on premium lights, crafts and imports. Execution and distribution continue to be a major focus area for 2011, and we're investing heavily behind our programs, including multicultural outreach. ", "We also remain focused on core brand innovations. Coors Light super cold activation packaging is resonating well with consumers, and we are supporting it with retail programs and national advertising. Miller Lite will continue its taste for positioning with new TV spots placed during prime sports programs.", "We are driving a strong focus on Hispanic soccer with Miller Lite's sponsorship of the Gold Cup tournament and the Chivas Mexican team sponsorship. ", "We are also driving Craft and Import growth through Tenth and Blake. In Blue Moon and Leinenkugel, we  have 2 of the largest and fastest-growing craft beer brands in the U.S. market.", "Our Leinenkugel Summer Shandy and its summer sample pack are helping to win this summer, and we continue to increase Blue Moon momentum with additional television and a focus on seasonals.", "In the U.K., our team continues to make substantial progress in improving underlying profitability through the expansion of our brand portfolio and our value ahead of volume strategy. During the second quarter, we grew market share for the third quarter in a row. With the completion of our SAP system implementation this summer, our focus during the second half of the year will be aligned behind specific brand building and innovation activities.", "Examples will include the rebranding of Carling, which will give the UK's largest beer brand new positioning, a new visual identity, innovative aluminum bottle packaging and a new premium line extension called Carling Chrome, which will be launched later this month.", "Another innovation to be launched is Anim\u00e9e, a beer tailored to women with a delicious fresh taste that will be available in 3 variations beginning in early autumn. Coors Light and Caffrey's will also add individual aluminum bottles to their package lineups.", "In our International business, we continue to invest in emerging and other markets to drive top and bottom line growth so this business can be a significant driver of Molson Coors growth in 5 years or less.", "We continue to expect incremental 2011 investments across several markets to total $25 million to $30 million on the MG&A line, including adding the new Cobra business in India, the Modelo brands in Japan and the joint venture in China to our results.", "Our expectation is that there will be no significant impact on the international group's bottom line as a result of this increase in MG&A spending, as these new investments would be largely offset by volume and gross profit in 2011.", "The following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the 4 weeks ended July 23 decreased at a mid-single-digit rate as we cycled strong volume growth and share gains in July of last year.", "In the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs have increased at a low single-digit rate due to cycling weak sales following the World Cup in the third quarter 2010. In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended July 23, MillerCoors STRs declined at a low single-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a small portion of the third quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "To summarize our discussion today, Molson Coors second quarter underlying after-tax earnings decreased about 1%. Positive beer pricing and cost reductions in our core businesses were offset by the impact of continuing weak economic conditions and global commodity inflation in the quarter. Despite these challenges, we remain focused on building shareholder value through our growth strategies, profit and cash generation and our disciplined use of cash.", "We also generated substantial cash in the quarter, a large portion of which will be returned to shareholders via our increased stock dividend and our new stock buyback program.", "While our short-term results reflect challenges, we are implementing aggressive measures to ensure that Molson Coors continues to drive profit, cash generation and shareholder value over the long term.", "Now before we get -- before we start on the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional question regarding the quarter results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "So at this point, Michelle, we'd like to open up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "First, I guess, Canada, I just wanted to get a little bit more perspective as we think about, if you look at 2Q, your volume and market share was down, your costs are coming in higher and your pricing is lagging inflation. So just wondering what gets better in the back half, if any?", "David Perkins", "All right. Thanks, Judy. It's Dave. So what we saw in Q2 was the continuation of the economic pressures that we felt recently. Certainly, gas prices and competition from other alcohol beverage is putting pressure on. Weather was a factor in Q2 as well. So we see that. Now as you think through the balance of the year on the industry, the only thing I'd point out is that last year, in the first 7 months of the year 2010, we did have 6 months that were essentially flat or up. So we had a strong performance in the first part of the year. In the last 5 months of the year, 4 of the 5 months were down at the industry level. So as Peter said, we're cycling something different going forward than we have seen on a year-to-date basis. On market share, we gave up about half of our gain in Q2 from the 1.5 points that we picked up last year. As I look at the market share result, I actually feel pretty good about it. I look at on a sequential basis, Q2 versus Q1, we actually grew our share marginally. And when I look at our innovation and our core brand programs, they're working well for us. So innovation in the quarter delivered about 3 share points for us. That's on the high end of what we've seen over the last year or so. So feel good there. Canadian trademark share was at last year's level in Q2 and we had strong pricing behind the brand. So we're feeling good there. We've got some new programming out on Canadian, including the Red Leaf program with a positive reaction. And then on Coors Light, our share was off slightly. But Coors Light was really the key beneficiary of that major spike in Q2 of last year. Again, we're seeing good brand equity scores on the brand. Our pricing was strong. So feeling good there. Last year, our market share performed particularly well through the end of August. Once we get into comps from September through to December, it is easier for us. So I just give you that perspective.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just in terms of -- I mean, I guess the comparisons do get easier, both from a market share perspective and for the industry as a whole. But just in terms of the competitive backdrop and the discounting activity you're seeing, is it your sense that, that would also moderate in the back half and that gives you a little bit more comfort as well?", "David Perkins", "Well, yes, hard for me to predict what will happen in the back half. What I would say in Q2 is the market was very competitive. We did see a step up in discounting compared to the first quarter. I think small brewers were especially active. Consumers continue to respond obviously to the special offers. But nonetheless, we saw an increase in our NSR per hectoliter in the  quarter despite that environment. And as I say, our brands performed where we'd like to see them performing.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then Peter and Stewart, just a couple of questions on capital allocation. First, on the share buyback announcement this morning, should we think that this may be an indication that, perhaps, the M&A opportunities might be a little bit more limited at least in the near term? And then Stewart, you talked about the $400 million cost currency swap that's out of money or that expires in 2012 and that's out of money. Can you just help us on how we think about the impact on your cash flow for 2012?", "Peter Swinburn", "I'll take the first part of that, Judy. I'll let Stewart take the second part. I'd really refer back to the New York conference with the analysts that we had in early March, and I think we laid out pretty clearly that what we wanted was to -- or certainly laid out pretty clearly we wanted flexibility in terms of the cash we'd hold on hand. We're comfortable, we do that. We wanted to make sure that we got a balance sheet in good order and we feel much better about what we've done around pensions and liabilities that we had on our balance sheet a couple of years ago. We did say that we really, when we look at cash, we continue to look at our use of cash to the extent that it can actually drive shareholder value. This is one way of giving value back to shareholders. It's not the only way. We will continue to look for M&A opportunities, but only if they actually drive the shareholder value that we would expect them to drive. So really, our position hasn't changed. And really, I think we flagged pretty clearly in New York what we would do if we didn't have any opportunities on the M&A front. And that's what we're doing. So I think we've been pretty consistent from the announcement and the clarity that we try to give in York and what we've actually done.", "S. Glendinning", "Good. Thank you, Peter. Judy, I'd just say I really echo Peter's point there, but this preserves flexibility for us going forward. And we think it's an excellent way to continue to try to drive shareholder value. On the swap itself, I called out in the script that we're looking at a number of alternatives. But I think the most likely scenario is that you'll see this be a combination of some settlement of a portion of the liability and some portion that gets extended. This will basically allow us to take that up over time. It will potentially subject us to movements up or down as in any hedging program, and will allow us to take into account tax considerations as well. Bottom line is it's a period of years, Judy. That's how you should look at that.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And then the tax rate coming in lower for this year, is there any change to your long-term tax rate at this point?", "S. Glendinning", "We continue to expect that our long-term guidance will remain the same at 22% to 26%. We're expecting the benefit of some one-time benefits in the back half of the year that could push our tax rate down.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer from Jefferies.", "Jeffrey Farmer - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I think several months ago you pointed to a few 100 basis points of additional margin expansion in the MillerCoors segment over the next few years. I realize that's a ways out. But if we just think about this for a second, if the U.S. economic backdrop that we're seeing right now carries deep into 2012, is that number still realistic or in play in your mind?", "David Dunnewald", "This is Dave Dunnewald. That's actually SABMiller guidance, and so we'll leave it to them to comment on that.", "Jeffrey Farmer - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then just following up real quick on Canada as it relates to you mentioned innovation driving 3 points of growth. Are you willing to sort of talk about the brands that are driving that and the sustainability you think you'll see moving into the back half of '11?", "David Perkins", "Yes, I mean, the innovation is fairly broad based. In the past 6 months, we've rolled M, Molson M out to Ontario and the West. We've got Molson Canadian 67 Sublime and Miller Chill lemon in the flavored area and Rickard's Blonde, and those are building on top of the Keystone brands. And we've actually got fairly solid performance across the group of new brands. And you were far enough into this now that I'm actually feeling pretty good about the way the brands are performing and the staying power that they're showing.", "Jeffrey Farmer - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then just quick follow-up on Canada. You talked about this. But just following up on the competitive discounting, realizing that you can't predict what happens on the back half of '11. But was that competitive discounting intensifying as you moved through the 2Q?", "David Perkins", "It was fairly stable through Q2. And I would say it was a step-up rather than a dramatic shift in the environment that we're seeing. Clearly, there is some response to the volume softness. But I'd characterize it as more of a step-up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I guess, Dave, on Canada, also on a -- probably a  little bit more on the price discounting you're seeing. Could you talk a little bit more about the regions where you're seeing the discounting and how you think it affects the outlook for pricing across Canada beyond looking into the second half and into 2012?", "David Perkins", "Yes, Mark. There's not much regional variation in what we're seeing, which actually is encouraging. I mean, this isn't like something that we saw 3 years ago in Qu\u00e9bec where you get a fairly severe situation in a region. So we're seeing that step up across the country as, presumably, people go after volume. And I'm not very alarmed by it. I think given the circumstances with the industry contacts, it's a fairly predictable reaction to that.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. And are you seeing it both from your major competitor in the lower-end products? Or is it more weighted towards the lower-end products?", "David Perkins", "No, it's across the portfolios, actually. I mean, as you look at the various brewers across the country, I mean, whether it's mainstream or above premium, you're seeing temporary discounting behavior. In the value segment, the prices tend to be fairly stable.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Great. And then, yes, Peter or Stewart, on the share repo news, for the sake of modeling, any thoughts on how we should put it into our models over the next few years? I guess you're saying some of it is going to come in the second half. Is it reasonable to think ratably? I realize you don't know what deals you're going to do, but can you give us some sense of pace here?", "S. Glendinning", "Yes, Mark, I really can't. I mean, what we said is that we're going to do it opportunistically. We've laid out the 3-year period, but it will largely depend on how we think that's going to drive shareholder value. So I'm sorry, but I can't give you more than that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Faucher from JPMorgan.", "John Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And just a quick follow-up on Mark's question. I mean, by opportunistically and looking at best way to drive shareholder value, basically, it sounds like you're just saying, look, if the stock is down, then we'll be more aggressive. But it's not going to be sort of an in the market everyday type of thing, correct?", "S. Glendinning", "We really don't want to get into the details of exactly how we plan to trade. That's counterproductive. What I will say is, look, we're sitting on $1.2 billion worth of cash. And we continue to generate cash. This is a company that generates a lot of cash. We're going to have the flexibility to do all of the things that we need to do with using a varied pace depending on what the opportunities that present themselves to us. And that's the best way really I can give, bearing in mind also that we'll be paying dividends over that same timeframe.", "John Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Got it. Okay. And then a separate question. I think you guys talked about some marketing spending in the U.K. shifting out of the second quarter. And I think we saw a similar thing, and they talked about this on the MillerCoors call in terms of some of the NFL-related spending shifting. So I guess, it seems like the spending shift was most likely budgeted in something planned ahead of time and it doesn't sound like it's a response to continued tough category trend. Is that a fair statement? And as you shift some of that spending into the back half of the year, should we -- can you get a payoff that quickly where maybe that helps drive a little better volume going forward?", "Peter Swinburn", "So you're absolutely right, they were planned. As far as the U.K. is concerned, we had a major SAP implementation. So really, all of our efforts were placed on making sure that, that went through smoothly. And it seems we had a great job there. So we did plan for most of the activity in the U.K. to be back loaded. You'll get some benefit on the top line from that activity because there are some new product innovation, but obviously, you won't get a bottom line benefit from new products in such a short period of time. For the established brands, such as Carling, then yes, we would expect the impact of the expenditure to be reflected in better performance. On the U.S., it was more a structural thing where we've lost the NFL and we had first half spending on that last year. That's really being translated more to the NHL now on the second half of the year. But again, Tom, you're on the line, if you want to expand on that, please do.", "Tom Long", "No.  I think you covered it precisely. Thank you, Peter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Watson from HSBC.", "James Watson - HSBC", "First question is just back to Canada for a second. Wanted to know about the price gaps versus your competitors, both your primary competitors and the smaller competitors. Just how are they right now compared to historical ranges? And seeing that you guys took up pricing a little bit, if the price gap is getting larger, does this take-away from some of your flexibility to make moves in the market?", "David Perkins", "Yes, James, we haven't left the price gaps relative to any major competitors change appreciably. So we've remained competitive. Certainly, there has been some increased aggression from smaller brewers that it's difficult to fully keep pace with. But I wouldn't characterize it as a really significant widening of gaps. I mean, we continue to do promotional activity by region, by channel and by pack site that keeps us in the ballpark of competitiveness. We watch the price and volume balance, and then make sure that our brands are able to perform for us. So I think the challenge for us that we need to watch is just that gap relative to some of the smaller players.", "James Watson - HSBC", "And on the international MG&A, you guys talked about an additional spend on MG&A there for the rest of the year. I was just wondering is that behind the brands that you've already bought. And then is that something that we can look to going forward into 2012 that there's just going to be a higher sort of base level of spending to build up these new opportunities internationally?", "Krishnan Anand", "Jim, this is Kandy. Yes, these are behind the new brands as we mentioned in our release. It's behind our India Cobra acquisition, our cycling of a continued -- of our general JV as well as the Modelo brands that came out as superior [ph] in Japan. So these are ongoing MG&A increases. But I want to emphasize what Peter said in his remarks, which is the net effect of these on the bottom line of the company is not significant because it also comes with increased gross profit.", "Peter Swinburn", "Just to expand on that a little bit. We're actually very pleased the way the international program is going. Although more opportunities have presented themselves in the short term than we expected, we've been able to take advantage of that. And as we said in the script, it's already contributing 15% of our net sales of revenue growth and we've been pretty clear about what we expect this section or this sector to do for the business going forward. So it's something that is for the future, but we're very pleased with the way with the progress that's being made in that arena.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Christine Farkas from Bank of America.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Just picking up with the last point, overseas, the Chinese joint venture, can you comment on ultimate CapEx requirements? Are you happy with the way the distribution agreements or the licensing agreement is working out? And would you look further down the road into building facilities?", "Peter Swinburn", "So trying and hit all of those points, Christine. First of all, let's split the China business up into 2. We've got this, our legacy Coors Light business. That brand continues to do exceptionally well in China. And we're pleased with its continued progress, and it's absolutely right in line with where we expected it to be and it continues to build equity value. So we're very pleased with that. In terms of the JV, it is going slower than we expected. But a lot of that really has have to do with getting certain commissions and certain licenses. We now have those. And we're in a position where we can put in the CapEx that we always planned to put in, which will allow us to get much more flexibility around the Coors Light brand, of course the number of SKUs that we can produce and improve the margins. So from that point of view, slightly behind the timescale we initially envisaged, but everything is going to plan and we're pleased with that. In terms of the future, we've got enough on our plates at the moment with building the Coors Light brand and also trying to get the JV and the CapEx away. So that's what we're really focused on at the moment. But I will always give myself the out, which is if the right opportunity came up in China and it satisfied all our criteria, we would seriously ask it.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. And then moving to price mix across your segments. I don't think I've missed this, but could you help us with respect to the mix contribution within that revenue per hectoliter growth? So Canada was up 2.2% with respect to revenue per hectoliter. I'm wondering what current line pricing looked like relative to mix?", "David Perkins", "Yes, so on the Canada NSR per hectoliter, it was, about half of that increase was related to our contract brewing arrangement and half was to stronger pricing. And within that, mix didn't play a role.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then in the U.K. and the U.S.?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, so from a U.K. perspective, we've now had 18 quarters of our pricing growth and that Q2 of this year, that was principally driven by the addition of Modelo into our portfolio. We saw a continued pricing in the on-premise unit pricing growth in the off, but a little bit of overall price decline in all 3 because of customer mix. But the principal driver of pricing growth was addition of the Modelo brands into the portfolio.", "Peter Swinburn", "Tom, do you have a number for -- or Tom or Kandy, for the U.S.?", "Tom Long", "As far as pricing growth and mix is concerned, mix accelerated in the quarter, either to around 80 basis points of that was mix and the balance would be pricing growth. Mix is slightly stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first.", "Christine Farkas - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just the last question maybe it's more anecdotal than anything else because you have given us STRs for the first 4 weeks. But given a strong heat wave across much of the Northeast or into Canada, I'm just wondering is that something that actually helps your volumes or hurts it? Are we seeing just many outdoor activities being canceled? Or are you seeing some benefit to people out and just having to be hydrated?", "Peter Swinburn", "Broad answer is I've got no idea, but there are probably just as many people that want to go out and drink more as there are people who want to stay in and keep cool. So we'll have to see what the numbers turn out like.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "A quick question on Canada. If innovation is driving 300 basis points of share gain and your share is down 75 basis points, can you elaborate on what brands are the main drivers of the weakness? What you're doing about it? And then on the innovation side, there was a lot of, I guess, regional launches last year and expansion across Canada. So can you talk about how the innovation is performing within the regions in which they were introduced last year?", "David Perkins", "Yes, let me just be clear on the 3 share points that innovation accounts for.  That is not growth year-over-year. That is the total of our new brands, okay. And so what we're seeing is about the 3 share points from innovation, we're seeing the Molson Canadian trademark stable and then Coors Light off slightly as I mentioned before. On a regional basis, we're seeing a solid contribution from innovation across the regions. I wouldn't want to get into the brand level detail by region. But I would say that as we look across our 4 major regions, we're getting a meaningful contribution from innovation in each, and we're seeing similar trends year-on-year in each.", "Operator", "I have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to Mr. Swinburn for closing remarks.", "Peter Swinburn", "Okay, thank you, Michelle. And thank you, everybody for joining us this morning. I really appreciate your interest in the business, and look forward to speaking to you again at the next earnings results. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Swinburn", "Thank you, Martina. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. With me on the call is Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors CFO; Dave Perkins, COO of Molson Coors Canada; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Mark Hunter, the CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, President of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors VP of Investor Relations. ", "On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will take you through highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2011 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some initial perspectives on 2012. For Molson Coors, the fourth quarter was a positive finish to a challenging year, with underlying after-tax income up more than 42%; earnings per share, up 47%; and net sales growth of 12%. The fourth quarter benefited from solid pricing, an additional week in our fiscal 2011 calendar and cycling comparatively weak quarterly results the year before. ", "For the full year, net sales increased 8% and underlying earnings per share grew nearly 6%, driven by positive pricing, cost reduction initiatives, favorable foreign currency movements and an additional trading week. Our focus in 2011 continued to be on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy, namely to grow profitably in our core businesses to advance in innovation, to grow in new and emerging markets and, when it meets our strict shareholder return criteria, to grow through M&A. ", "In 2011, our primary focus remained on the first of these pillars as we continued to invest in our key brands and fill our innovation pipeline. Increased sales, pricing and underlying earnings tell us we are moving in the right direction. In Canada, during 2011, we grew volume and profit in the back half of the year to improve performance of Coors Light, Molson Canadian and our above premium portfolio, highlighted by the launch of Rickard's Blonde and the expansion of Creemore and Granville Island into new markets. ", "Our Canada team secured the key national hockey league sponsorship property, which is adding visibility to our brands. We introduced Molson Canadian 67 Sublime and Miller Chill Lemon, and we expanded Molson Canadian 67 into Qu\u00e9bec and Molson M into Ontario on the west. In the U.S., Coors Light significantly outperformed the premium light segment, in both share and average price and became the second largest beer in the market. The Blue Moon brands continued to lead the craft beer segment, with more than 20% growth. Leinenkugel's also grew to double-digit rate. These brands drive the Tenth and Blake business, which is focused on our craft and import brands. We introduced value-driving innovations, including Coors Light Super Cold activation and expanded the Miller Lite aluminum pint, Leinenkugel Summer Shandy, Blue Moon Seasonals and Batch 19 all into new markets. ", "However, the Miller Lite performance was a disappointment. In a very challenging U.K. market, we gained market share, and in the first half of the year, successfully completed a major SAP system implementation and then focused on brands and innovation in the second half, with the result being accelerated share performance. We acquired the Sharp's Brewery and Doom Bar brand early in 2011, added the Modelo brands to our portfolio and relaunched Carling and Coors Light in the second half. We introduced aluminum bottles for Carling, Coors Light and Caffrey's, and we had a limited launch of Carling Chrome and Anim\u00e9e. ", "Also in the second half of 2011, we initiated a multi-year redevelopment program for our U.K. brewing network, which will support brand growth, innovation and operations efficiencies in the years ahead. The second pillar of our growth strategy, our approach to international organic growth, is based upon disciplined market development, strong strategic partnerships and sound investment in our brands. Specifically in 2011, we expanded our Cobra partnership to include the Indian subcontinent, which now gives us global control of this promising premium brand. Together with our partner, Obolon, we set up a commercial venture to sell Carling in the Ukraine, Eastern Europe's second-biggest beer market, and this venture is off to a very strong start. ", "We continue to experience depressed markets, cost inflation and subpricing environments, exacerbated in the U.K. by punitive excise tax increases. This is a situation we do not see improving for some time. In M&A, the Sharp's acquisition has gone exceptionally well,, with the Doom Bar brand growing strongly, and now it is in the top 3 U.K. on-premise cask ale brands. The India partnership is also off to a solid start. These pillars of our growth strategy, paired with disciplined cash use and cost management, are designed to drive profit, cash flow and long-term share [ph] value to our shareholders. ", "During the past 4 years, we have used our cash to capitalize on growth opportunities, strengthen our balance sheet and double our dividends per share. In 2011, we further strengthened our balance sheet by settling 1/4 of our cross-currency swaps for approximately $100 million and paid down the outstanding Ontario beer store debt with $94 million in cash. In addition, following the announcement of our $1.2 billion stock repurchase plan in August, we repurchased approximately 7.5 million Class B shares by year end. Stewart will provide more details in a few minutes. ", "Beyond our growth pillars in 2011, our Resources for Growth Two cost reduction program delivered $60 million in savings for the year and a total of $126 million in savings since the program began 2 years ago. And in the area of corporate social responsibility, Molson Coors was selected for inclusion in the Dow Jones sustainability index, which is the most recognized global benchmark of sustainability on nonglobal corporations. We were 1 of only 6 North American food and beverage companies chosen to be in this index. ", "So with that as an overview, I'll now turn it over to Stewart to give fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on our 2011 cash generation and uses. Stewart, over to you.", "S. F. Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. In the fourth quarter financial highlights, worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased 2.6% on a 53-week basis. Excluding the 53rd week in our fiscal 2011, worldwide volume decreased 0.1% driven by decline in U.S. volume, which was largely offset by volume growth in our U.K., International and Canada businesses. ", "Total company net sales increased 12.2% in the fourth quarter primarily driven by the 53rd week in 2011, along with higher sales in the U.K., International and Canada businesses. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $176 million or $0.97 per diluted share was 42.4% higher than a year ago, driven by improved financial performance in each of our businesses. For our total company, the 53rd week increased 2011 worldwide sales volume by about 300,000 hectoliters and boosted pretax profit by an estimated $9 million. ", "It's important to note that our fourth quarter underlying earnings exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to an $8.6 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in the earnings release we distributed this morning. In segment performance highlights for the fourth quarter, starting with Canada, underlying pretax income increased 22.2% to $129.9 million, driven by increased net pricing, MG&A expense reductions, the addition of NAB contract brewing income this year and the additional week in our fiscal 2011. ", "The extra week in the fourth quarter added about 140,000 hectoliters to Canada sales volume and an estimated USD $12 million to pretax profit. This benefit was slightly offset by the $2 million impact of a 1% year-over-year decrease in the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Sales-to-retail or STRs increased 7.1% in the fourth quarter, largely due to the additional sales week in 2011. Excluding the extra week, comparable fourth quarter STRs increased 0.2%. Our Canada market share declined approximately 0.5 share point from a year ago. Net sales per hectoliter increased nearly 4% in local currency, with more than 1/3 of this driven by continued positive pricing and the remainder due to the addition of NAB contract brewing sales this year. ", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 6% in local currency, with about half of the increase due to the cost of brewing beer under our NAB contract, and the remainder driven by higher distribution costs and input inflation. These factors are partially offset by RFG2 savings in the quarter. Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased 5% in local currency, largely due to lower employee incentive compensation and other overhead expenses in the quarter. ", "Moving to our U.S. segment, underlying pretax income increased 27.2% to $85.5 million in the fourth quarter, driven by higher pricing and the results of cost savings initiatives, which more than offset the impact of lower volume and higher input inflation. MillerCoors domestic STR declined 3.3% on a trading day adjusted basis, while domestic sales to wholesalers declined 1.6% with the variance to STRs driven by the quarterly timing of shipments last year. ", "Domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, grew 2.9% primarily due to frontline pricing. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 0.9% in the quarter driven by higher freight, packaging innovations, brand mix and commodity inflation, partially offset by continued cost savings. MG&A expense decreased 3.7% for the quarter. In our U.K. business, fourth quarter underlying pretax income increased 29.4% to $34.8 million due to overall higher volumes and lower pension costs, partly offset by lower net pricing and higher marketing investments. ", "These results reflect minimal profit impact from a 1% depreciation of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar, and the additional week in 2011. STRs increased 16%, reflecting a strong performance in both the on-premise and the off-premise channels: customer buying ahead of our 2012 price increase and the cycling for U.K. weather in 2010 and the approximate 165,000 hectoliter benefit of the additional week in 2011. Excluding the impact of the extra week, STRs increased 9%. With overall industry volumes decreasing an estimated 1.4% from a year ago, this represented share growth for us in both the on-premise and the off-premise. Own brand net sales per hectoliter decreased 1% in local currency, driven by a 6% lower net pricing largely offset by the mix benefit of adding the higher-priced Modelo brands. ", "Net pricing in the quarter was impacted by an increasingly competitive market dynamics and adverse customer impact mix in the off-premise, partially offset by positive pricing in the on-premise. Total cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased approximately 2% in local currency driven by fixed cost leverage from higher volumes and cost savings, partly offset by input inflation and the addition of the Modelo brands. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased nearly 2% in local currency due to higher marketing investments and the impact of the 53rd week in 2011, partly offset by lower employee incentive and pension expense. ", "Now to help improve visibility into our international business, we began separating results for these operations from our corporate expenses for the first time in the fourth quarter. The international segment posted an underlying pretax loss of $7.5 million in the fourth quarter, and this $2.2 million improvement from a year ago was driven by increased sales of higher-margin brands this year. International volume increased 51% due to the addition of the Modelo brands in Japan, along with the growth of Carling in Europe and Coors Light in Latin America and China. ", "Net sales per hectoliter increased 24% and cost of goods sold per hectoliter grew 16%, primarily due to sales mix improvements, including higher sales of Zima and Modelo brands in Japan and Carling in Europe. International MG&A increased 35%, driven by investments in our Ukraine, India, China, Spain and Russia businesses. Meanwhile, underlying corporate expenses totaled $52.3 million pretax for the fourth quarter. This reduction of $3.9 million was primarily due to lower employee incentive compensation. ", "The 53rd week in 2011 added approximately $3 million of interest and overhead expense in the fourth quarter. Now moving beyond the fourth quarter operating performance, underlying free cash flow for 2011 was $635 million, down 31% from 2011 and $115 million below our original goal for the year, which was $750 million plus or minus 10%. While most of the free cash miss was due to timing of working capital, the result was, nonetheless, disappointing. ", "Our 2011 cash generation was made up of the following: $868 million of operating cash flow, including $458 million from MillerCoors, plus $20 million of proceeds from asset sales in the Foster\u2019s swap unwind, minus $235 million of capital spending and minus $17 million of net cash invested in MillerCoors. Lower underlying cash for 2011 is primarily due to onetime cash sources in 2010 and higher capital spending, $58 million plus MillerCoors, as well as higher cash taxes of $24 million and higher working capital this year largely due to timing. ", "Consistent with our usual practice, we plan to share our 2012 underlying free cash flow goal with you during our Investor Day in New York next month. Regarding cash uses in 2011, Peter mentioned our stock buybacks and partial cross-currency swap settlement and the Ontario beer store debt paydown. Totaling more than $500 million, these cash uses strengthened our balance sheet, improved our debt ratios with the rating agencies and reduced our share count at an attractive price. We ended the year with $884 million of cash in our balance sheet, and here are the details regarding the buyback. ", "During the fourth quarter, we bought back approximately 1.2 million Class B common shares for $50 million in cash. Since the inception of the program in August 2011, we have repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares for $321.1 million, which is approximately 27% of the total program, and just over 4% of our outstanding Class B shares. As originally announced, we have been implementing this program opportunistically. As always, all potential cash uses will be vetted by our disciplined growth process and must meet our firm criteria of providing a clear view to building long-term shareholder value. ", "Looking forward, regarding our 2012 guidance, we expect 2012 MG&A expense in corporate to be approximately $115 million. This would represent a $12 million increase from 2011, driven by higher incentive compensation and project expenses. We expect full year 2012 corporate interest expense to be approximately $100 million based on current foreign exchange rates, a reduction of $8 million from 2011. Turning to our effective tax rate, we expect a full year underlying rate for 2012 in the range of 17% to 21%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. While we continue to see our normalized long-term tax rate in the range of 22% to 26%. We anticipate that it will take a few years to move up to that range. ", "Our 2012 capital spending outlook is approximately $200 million for the full year. This $35 million decrease from last year is driven by a lower capital spending in Canada following the installation of the new high-speed can line in our Montr\u00e9al brewery. Note that this capital spending guidance excludes the U.S. Regarding our defined benefit pensions for 2012, our preliminary view is that U.K. pension expense will increase about $10 million, that means from $7 million of pension income in 2011 to about $3 million of pension expense this year. ", "In Canada, we anticipate that our 2012 expense -- pension expense will increase approximately $20 million from 2011. In the U.S., we expect a decrease of about $15 million, on an underlying basis, which excludes a $22 million special charge in the third quarter of 2011 related to MillerCoors assuming a multi-employer pension plan, that's at 42%. ", "Taking these together, our total company 2012 pension expense is expected to be approximately $80 million, including our portion of the MillerCoors pension expense, which is about $15 million higher than 2011 on an underlying basis. This increase is driven by current long-term interest rates, which are now lower than at any point in the past 60 years. Meanwhile, we expect total cash contributions to our pensions to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million this year, up from $59 million in 2011. This is due to increased contributions in Canada and in the U.S. ", "Looking ahead, our cost outlook in Canada for 2012, we expect our all-in cost of goods sold to increase at a mid single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency, due to input inflation and higher distribution and pension costs, as well as the cost of brewing NAB contract volume, which was largely absent from our first half results last year. In the U.S., we forecast COGS per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate in 2012. In the U.K., we expect our full year COGS per hectoliter to grow at a high single-digit rate in local currency, with about half of the increase due to input inflation; 40% due to sales mix; and 10% from onetime expenses related to our U.K. brewery improvements this year. ", "The incremental brewery expenses will total about $8 million in 2012 primarily in the first half of the year, and we expect these improvements to provide significant returns in the years ahead. At this point, I'll turn it over to Peter for total company and regional outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Stewart. So we expect 2012 to be as challenging as 2011 in all of our markets. Additionally in 2012, as Stewart has outlined, we anticipate negative foreign exchange rates and increased pension expense. We firmly believe that we have to continue to focus on our core brands and new innovation to drive top line revenue, and this means growing Coors Light, Carling, Molson Canadian and Miller Lite. We also need to execute our innovation program effectively, and to help ensure this is achieved, we plan to invest incrementally in marketing this coming year. ", "We will continue to grow our existing international businesses and move them forward profitably over the next few years. Finally, we will consider prudent value enhancing growth opportunities to M&A. Despite these efforts, we expect the early part of the year to be especially challenging, partly due to higher brewery, marketing and pension costs. Additionally, we will be cycling the release of a $3.8 million indirect tax reserve in Canada in the first quarter of 2011 and the volume pull-forward of the U.K. price increase, which we estimate pulled in nearly $3 million from Q1 2012. ", "These factors will put increased pressure on Q1 results. And, of course, later this year, we will be cycling lower employment incentive expenses and the 53rd week sales in Canada and the U.K. By way of regional outlook, in Canada, beyond the focus on Coors Light and Canadian, we have begun full activation of the NHL sponsorship. That drives relevance to our brands with hockey fans, a key consumer group in Canada. Our -- the premium brands were highly successful in 2011 and finished the year with real positive momentum, contributing 1/4 per share point of growth to our portfolio in the fourth quarter. ", "Specifically, the Rickard's brands have benefited from some successful innovative brand launches. We will gain further geographic expansion of the Creemore and Granville Island brands with the Six Pints, our new craft and speciality group. Beyond our current offerings, we plan to introduce some exciting new brands unpackaging in 2012, which we expect will further strengthen our portfolio and our competitive position in Canada. ", "In the U.S., we will unveil our new take on Miller Lite taste at our distributor convention in mid-March. Innovations such as the aluminum pint and the vortex bottle, have been well received by consumers and will continue to be a focus. We'll unveil the innovative Miller Lite Taste Flow Can along with new programs to drive Miller Lite engagement among our African, American and Latino consumers. With Coors Light, we'll continue to drive success with the super cold activation along with other packaging innovations such as the aluminum pint. We will also remain focused on multicultural programs that reach Hispanic consumers through local market soccer activations and the Coors Light Fan\u00e1ticos Del Frio website. ", "Miller 64, the relaunch of MGD 64 brand, will be available at retail by the end of this month with bold new packaging and positioning. Tenth and Blake will continue to drive momentum around Blue Moon with Seasonals such as Blue Moon Spiced Amber Ale. We are also looking at extending the Leinenkugel Shandy brand with a version for the fall, and we'll continue to grow Peroni with a strong focus in the on-premise channel. ", "Additionally, we will leverage our minority equity investments in Terracon [ph] beer company and in our acquisition of the Crispin Cider Company last week, which gives us significant and immediate presence in one of the industry's fastest growing categories. In the U.K., since our SAP system implementation in summer 2011, the team has -- was focused on brand building and innovation activities. In 2012, we will be launching a major investment focus on the refreshed positioning behind Cobra and Carling, plus Carling Chrome and further new Carling brand extensions. We will be on that consistently through spring and summer. And Coors Light will return with heavyweight support to build on last year's double-digit growth. We are well into the first stage of a multi-year redevelopment program in our U.K. brewing network in order to improve bottle innovation, flexibility and performance, including additional brewing capacity for Doom Bar, and will enable us to deliver on our brand and innovation agenda. ", "By the middle of this year, we will have new flow up capability up and running, and a new energy center and flexible bottling line will be under construction for early 2013 commissioning. During 2012, Molson Coors International will continue to focus on leveraging the investments made in new markets and infrastructure over the past 2 years. The primary focus will be to continue to drive double-digit top line growth in the key strategic markets of China, India, Russia, U.K. and Spain, focusing on the key brands of Coors Light, Carling and Cobra. ", "While we anticipate similar overall investment levels in these businesses in 2012 versus last year, we expect these investments to be somewhat front-loaded this year. Our overriding international goal remains to build this group of businesses quickly and to reduce our investment per hectoliter so that our international group becomes a significant contributor to total company profitability by 2015. ", "Finally, the following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in 2012. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 5 weeks of 2012 declined at a high single-digit rate versus 2011. This decline is largely a result of calendar differences related to the 53rd week in 2011. The January volume reporting for fiscal 2011 included the week leading up to New Year's Eve, whilst this week is excluded from our early 2012 fiscal results. ", "On a comparable basis, 2012 first 5-week STR volume is down low single digit versus 2011. In the U.S. for the first 5 weeks ended February 4, STRs declined at a low single-digit rate on a trading day adjusted basis. In the first 6 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a mid single-digit rate, largely for the same reasons as Canada. And in the first 5 weeks of the quarter, our international STRs have increased at a double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead. ", "So to summarize our discussions today, the fourth quarter for Molson Coors was a positive finish to a challenging year, underlying tax income up more than 42%; earnings per share up 47%; and net sales growth of 12%. For the full year, net sales increased 8%; underlying earnings per share were up nearly 6%, driven by positive pricing, cost reduction initiatives, favorable foreign currency movements and the additional week in 2011. ", "Despite some challenging market conditions, our focus continues to be on growing our business. Rather than waiting for the market to come to us, we're building on 3 pillars of our growth strategy, which are to grow profitably in our core business through brands innovation, to grow in new and emerging markets, and when it meets our strict shareholder criteria, to grow through M&A. Our primary focus remains on the first of these pillars, as we continue to invest in our key brands and fill our innovation pipeline and core markets. We will increase our investment behind our brands to drive top line growth and take advantage of changing consumer taste and new market segments as they emerge. ", "Our approach to global organic growth is based on disciplined market development, strong strategic partnerships and sound investments in our brands. These growth strategies, paired with a disciplined cash use and cost management, will drive profit, cash flow and long-term value for shareholders. ", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours. Also, at 2 p.m. Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. So at this point, Martina, can we open it for the questions please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First, I guess, just in terms of the Canada performance, it sounds like the fourth quarter share was a little bit softer, so any color as to the competitive dynamics and how you're thinking about your ability to hold onto the pricing in that market. And it sounds like January trend, even excluding the extra week impact, was also still somewhat softer, so what are you seeing just in terms of the most recent trend there as well?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I'll let Dave do the detail on that, but I mean, the one thing I would point out, Judy, is that if you look at the total year, then we've certainly seen improvement in Canada in the second half, from an industry basis point of view, which we're pleased to say. And also, as I called out, we're very pleased with our premium portfolio performance in Canada as well. But, Dave, do you want to talk to the specifics?", "David Perkins", "Yes, for sure. It's Dave. So, yes, what we've seen in Q4 was strong industry performance, up 1.8% when you take out the 53rd week impact. So we've had 2 quarters in a row that feel good. We've had good weather through those 6 months, but certainly I think, some of the value offerings and innovation that have gone into the market have made a difference. Consumer behavior seems to be changing. I think the folks are loosening up a little bit on their wallets, and so that's playing true well for us. In terms of the competitive environment, pricing bids continue to be very competitive right across the country through Q4. Consumers continue to respond to that activity. December is, obviously, a pretty important month, and I think, with the slow start to the year with the first half being soft, we did see a spike in activity and pricing activity in December, not to be unexpected. We gave up the 0.5 share point that you've referenced, that largely comes from our unsupported brands. Innovation continued to deliver about 3 share points for us in the quarter, which is really good. As Peter referenced, our import performance, which I had called out in Q3, as the softness actually strengthened up for us in Q4 so that was good to see. And if you look at the 10 or 11 brands that we put our focus behind, we grew a share or volume on all but 2 and we're able to get price increases through as well, so I feel good on that. Coors Light in Qu\u00e9bec, we gave up a marginal amount of market share because of competitive pricing. But Coors Light grew in the rest of the country. So overall, I think as we continue to play with the price and volume balance, it feels like we have it about right, but no doubt it's a competitive environment there and we'll continue to focus on that.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just following up the unsupported brands as a portion of your portfolio, can you quantify how big that is, and is that sort of a drag in terms of the share performance going forward or just in the fourth quarter given the competitive activity at the value end that just got hurt more.", "David Perkins", "Well, we've seen softness on the unsupported brands right through the year. They would likely -- I don't have a precise number for you, but I would say probably high single-digit or very low double-digit as a percent of our portfolio. And -- so what we try to do with those brands is migrate the drinkers through to the brands that we support over time. As far as your question on January, I mean, January is a small month for us. We are down low single-digit, so far, when you take out the 53rd week impact. It's difficult to establish a real pattern so far. There are some things in the market that feel good to me in terms of the pricing environment. We'll see how they play out through the rest of the quarter, but in the West, we have seen some selective price increases that seem to be in the right direction. In Qu\u00e9bec, we've seen -- but not brewer-instigated price changes, but retailer price increases, which I think were a positive sign. So there is some encouraging news there.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Stewart, just on the free cash flow generation in 2011, just in terms of the miss versus your target, just can you elaborate on some of the buckets, where that shortfall came from. And then, obviously, we'll wait for your March meeting, but just broadly speaking in 2012, it sounds like maybe you're making additional pension contributions. So your ability to sort of step up the cash flow side, and then the buyback, obviously, the pace seems to have slowed down in the fourth quarter, is that sort of indicative of maybe cash generation in 2012 potentially being a little bit more subdued than what you've previously thought?", "S. F. Glendinning", "Let me take those, Judy. So first, let's take the buyback first. I wouldn't necessarily connect those dots. We'll say that we bought back almost $325 million worth of shares, that's a huge chunk of money back to shareholders. It still left us with some almost $900 million in cash, which we think is an appropriate level. And we have said that we'd like to maintain flexibility, that's the reason I wouldn't necessarily connect any other dots, as you say, we will share with you, in a couple of weeks when we are in New York, our guidance for 2012 and we'll be prepared to explain all the details around that. With respect to the miss, we did call on the third quarter, as we saw the year turning out a little bit tougher than we expected, that we expect to be at the lower end of the range. Then, in fact, it was true, that played out, but what also played out were some timing items on working capital, and we expect some of that to come back in the next year. So if you'd looked at that, just to sort of dimensionalize that, somewhere in the $40 million to $50 million range, which explains the difference between the bottom of the range and the number we ended up with.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Dave, I wanted to talk a little bit more about Canada. And I was wondering, the comments you just made about feeling a little better about the pricing environment, and you remarked that Quebec, the retailers have started taking some incremental pricing. Can you talk a little bit more about Qu\u00e9bec, specifically, and anything else that leads to that comment about the pricing environment?", "David Perkins", "Yes, so in Qu\u00e9bec what we've seen, Mark, is that almost all of the major retailers have moved away from the minimum price, have moved away from that floor, and generally are up about $1 a case, a case being at 24, from that level, and that's just happened in recent weeks. And so we'll see consumer reaction and how that plays out, but that feels good. And then in Western Canada, it's really selective price increases that we or other brewers have been pursuing, that would reflect a strengthening environment there. In Ontario, the next catalyst to any pricing change would be the increase, the index increase for the minimum price. So on an annual basis, the minimum price has increased by, I think, it's a weighted average of the prior 3 years CPI. And in Qu\u00e9bec, the beginning of the second quarter, there is also a CPI adjustment to the minimum price there.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "In what month again?", "David Perkins", "That would be in April in Qu\u00e9bec, and it's in late March or early April in Ontario.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And as we think about -- I mean, a month is only a month, but as we think about the portfolio kind of in recent months, if you will, it sounds like the share performance has been a little softer than what you would like. You mentioned these unsupported brands, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the evolution and trends for Coors Light, specifically, and Canadian, specifically?", "David Perkins", "Yes, Canadian continues to hold or grow share so the brand's performance is strong. It will be receiving pretty significant support behind the NHL property as we go through into the playoffs this year. So new piece of news on that brand, which, I think, will be really positive for it. We weren't able to activate heavily in the tail end of 2011 because of some legal uncertainty that you'd be aware of, and so certainly, as we go into this year, you're going to see strong activation there behind Canadian. All the equity tracking that we're doing is very positive, so we're seeing the equity scores on the brand move up at rates that we haven't seen before. Coors Light continues to be a very strongly rated brand in our consumer tracking. As I said in the fourth quarter, it grew or held share everywhere but Qu\u00e9bec, where there was some pricing challenges that caused a minor erosion of market share. But Coors Light continues to be a strong brand for us, and there's no question, moving forward, that the thing that is very important for us is the performance of those 2 brands. There's a number of other things we do in our portfolio around the above-premium brands and the Six Pints and so on, but we really have to have that strengths from Canadian and Coors Light, they'll both benefit from the NHL exploitation. They will both benefit from innovation going forward. So the plan feels strong, the equity measures look good and the performance is good, along with NSR increases, which is really important.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. So it really does sound like that -- that maybe the unexpected to-do item is these unsupported brands as you head into '12, is that a fair characterization?", "David Perkins", "Yes, I mean, look, the losses are happening on the unsupported brands. The reality is that we need accelerated growth on Canadian and Coors Light to offset those declines. I don't want to try to slow the declines on brands that don't matter to our future. It's how do we feed our major brands with the volume that comes out of those. And, as I say, innovation, hockey program and just good solid marketing and day-to-day sales execution are the things that are going to make the difference for us on that. And so we're pushing into those brands really hard, and they'll make the difference for us. So we always have the price volume balance that we can play with. We've been tracking some share loss through 2011 knowingly and we do believe that our brand need to get NSR growth. And -- so we'll continue to play with that balance, but I feel pretty good about the balance right now, actually, and I think it's really for our marketing programs to continue to accelerate the performance on Canadian and Coors Light.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great, and if I could, finally on that. I don't know, Peter, if this is for you, but you've drawn our attention to the importance of marketing dollars not only in quality, but it sounds like in quantity. And I know you're not going to give us a percentage increase, but could you talk, maybe just directionally, about how you're thinking about the absolute level of support in the market of Canada today versus a year ago or even a few years ago, given the dynamics that have played out at the consumer and competitive level.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Two things, first of all, we try to make it very clear in the script that we recognize that we've got to grow the top line of this business. I think there's probably 3 areas that we're focused on. One, obviously, is the more dynamic area around crafts. And I think we've done a good job, whether we look at the U.S., with Blue Moon, Leinenkugel; as you look at Canada, with Creemore, Granville Island, Rickard's; if you look at the U.K., with Doom Bar, if I can be really knock that out of the court to be honest with you, but it's a small part of the overall portfolio. We talked about adjacencies or the impact of wines and spirits, and I think we feel really good about the innovative ideas that we have to address some of that space. So, again, we're pleased with that, but, really, the biggest U.S. [ph], as Dave has called out is we got to get our power brands moving forward, and that's Miller Lite, Coors Light, Carling and Canadian. And that's what'll make the difference, and so we want to put our marketing dollars behind those, as well as innovation. To give you some scale, it's difficult, it'll be a minimum of $30 million, really depends on how much we put behind innovation at the top end of the scale, so I think I'll leave it at that, if that's okay, if that helps.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so you're saying on those brands, on a combined basis, an incremental $30 million versus last year.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, as a minimum.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "At least as a minimum, great. And then just more on the modeling side, that's helpful. But over on the modeling side, Stewart, the pension up -- I'm not sure I even got it right, but I think you're saying pension up $80 million, is that the right number? And can you just give us the replay there on the amount by region?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes -- not, Mark, sorry, can I just come back, because you did reference Canada. My $2 billion [ph] is talking about the total business, okay.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Across regions, right. And that's on a 42% basis for the U.S. or that's excluding the...", "Peter S. Swinburn", "That excludes the U.S., I'm sorry...", "S. F. Glendinning", "So, Mark, let me just make everything clearer. So just to recap, what we said is that the U.K. will increase $10 million year-over-year. That'll move from a pension benefit, up $7 million in 2011 to $3 million of expense this year, $10 million year-over-year, then. In Canada, we expect expense to increase by $20 million from 2011, and then in the U.S., we actually expect a decrease of about $15 million on an underlying basis. So just ignore the $22 million that we saw come through this year, it was a special charge related to a multi-employee pension plan. So take those 3 things together and then you end up with about a $15 million year-over-year total for the company. $80 million is the total expense for the [indiscernible].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just want to follow up on a comment you had made in the prepared remarks, where you talked about 2012 being just as difficult as 2011, and just wanted to get a better handle on, is that from a market development standpoint, is that from an overall financial performance standpoint. I wasn't quite sure exactly where you were sort of taking us with that comment.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, John. Thanks for giving us the opportunity to expand on it. All we're trying to lay out there is when we look at the external environment, we certainly don't see things getting worse, but we certainly don't see them getting better to any great extent. If I had to put money on either side of that, and probably we expect it to get slightly better, but most importantly, not worse. That means that 2012 externally looks the same to us as 2011. Within that, however, we will continue to focus on what we think is important. I'll go back to the comments I just made to Mark about focusing on our core brands, especially the big brands and putting money behind that to actually generate top line growth. Does that help?", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It does and then I guess, the next question would be sort of -- and I know you guys don't give guidance, if the markets are about the same from your financial stand -- I mean, we're expecting tax to go up. Do you feel like your financial performance can be similar in 2012 as it was in 2011?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "That sounds like guidance to me, John.", "S. F. Glendinning", "I always say, it's not true we don't give any guidance. Of course, we do give guidance around MG&A and around our tax rate, and around the capital spending, around our COGS, it's some important elements. What we don't give is guidance around our top line.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Watson from HSBC.", "James Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "I had a quick follow-up on Canada. First, just about the competitive environment. I was hoping you could break it down a little more in terms of whether the competition -- the competitive pricing is more on the value segment, which I might imagine is your unsupported brands the ones struggling, and I imagine those are skewed towards value as well. And if you could just break down value versus premium and maybe smaller competitors versus your main competitor in the competition.", "David Perkins", "Yes, all right. On the pricing, it really comes into play at the premium and the above-premium level, it's actually rather than value, I mean, value tends to sit down close to the minimum price, anyway, so you will have some movement there, but the majority of the pricing action that we see is in the mainstream and above. And I would say it was across-the-board when you look at the competitive environment. We do see the smaller regional and national brewers active in this area on an ongoing basis, but certainly I would say through the fourth quarter and into December, it was fairly broad-based as opposed to regionally and across the industry.", "James Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "Okay. Are the price gaps between value, premium and above-premium staying about the same, then?", "David Perkins", "Yes, there hasn't been any fundamental shifts in that. There are certainly is, anytime there's a major price promotion going on in a market. You may see above-premium come down -- and this isn't just brewer action, it is sometimes retailer action. So, for instance, in Qu\u00e9bec in December, the retailers used the above-premium import brands as traffic builders, and so you'll see a fair amount of discounting there. And they'll come down fairly close to the price of our regular brands, and so it varies by region, what you actually see. But generally, the price gaps, on an ongoing basis, are holding up and we're seeing the action, as I say, in the premium and above-premium.", "James Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "Great. And then I just had another question on the U.K. Also, on the pricing environment there, I just noticed that you guys had a 6% lower net pricing kind of on your core brands, and at the same time, great volume and share gains there. So I was just wondering, that almost sounds like just from those stands, that you guys are the ones discounting there in order to gain share. But if you could give me a little more background on that competitive environment and anything I might be sort of missing in that quick analysis.", "Mark Hunter", "It's Mark Hunter here. I mean, I think you have to set a little context here. We've had about 19 quarters of total pricing growth in the U.K. when you include mix on unit pricing, 17 quarters of pure unit price growth as we've come through 2011 through Q2 through to Q4, we've had to be a little more competitive in the marketplace. The U.K. market from a volume perspective remains challenging, and certainly from an off-trade perspective, we've seen that competition increase pretty significantly. So our strategy is very clear, which is about driving for revenue growth. Wherever possible driving for value ahead of volume, and we remain flexible and employ tactics where required. So we're very clear about what we're about as a business, and I think we're responding to the market on a real-time basis.", "James Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "Are there -- I mean we've seen a lot of quarterly swings throughout 2011, but just going into 2012 compared to kind of entering 2011, is there a significant shift in where this market is?", "Mark Hunter", "I don't think there's a significant shift. There's one dynamic that has moved, it has been, really, the softness in the off-trade market. There are volumes in the off-trade over the last year, so we've actually finished last year where our total industry was down on a full year basis about 3.5 points and off-premise was down 3.7, on-premise was down 3.4. Now that's the first time for a long time that I can remember the off-premise volumes actually being softer than the on-premise. I think it's too early to tell whether that's a sustaining trend but it's certainly interesting and a shift in dynamic.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "If I can just build on that, James, again, just to step back from the minutia a little bit, if you look at the U.K. market, it's still roughly 50-50 on-premise, off-premise. We have consistently grown share in the on-premise. That's where your brands are built and where your brands remain, and they're not susceptible to fluctuations or promotional pricing. In the off-premise, Mark and his team have been very diligent in terms of trying to move pricing up, but what you've seen is actually just the strength of our brands. When we choose to be competitive in that area, we actually do exceptionally well. And so we've always got that lever to pull if we choose to pull it. So strategically, we're in a very strong position in the U.K. as to which way we want to go, and I think Mark and his team have done a great job putting us in that position.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions around -- I just want to make sure I captured some of the incremental costs for 2012. So pensions are an incremental $15 million, the tax rate's going to be higher, and then the corporate MG&A, I think if I took it down right, it's $115 million. Does that compare to -- what number does that compare to for 2011, is it $104 million?", "S. F. Glendinning", "It's going to be $12 million higher. And I guess, the only real difference in corporate this year is to point out that there's about $1 million that's in there that's related to the 53rd week. So that'll be the only small thing to point out, but [indiscernible] the actual year-over-year versus $103 million is the number to point to.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then Resources for Growth were about $60 million of contribution in 2011, is that right?", "S. F. Glendinning", "There's $60 million of savings in 2011, and another $24 million to go in 2012. Based on the current program, let me be specific about that.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And so we may hear more about something more incremental on that in March?", "S. F. Glendinning", "Wait to see how we frame it up in March, but, yes, the current program has $24 million still to go.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just, I guess, in terms of looking at gross profits for next year, gross margins for next year, is -- do you have all the pricing in place that you need at this point to cover your cost of goods per hectoliter outlook and also just how volatile could your cost of goods be, how much of your costs are locked in at this point?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I'll let Stewart take what's been locked in, but we've given guidance on our COGS. But I'm not going to give guidance on our top line pricing. We'll let you sort of work through that.", "S. F. Glendinning", "The only thing I would say is that U.S. is taking pricing at the end of the year, and U.K. is also taking some pricing. So we'll have to see how that plays out during the year, but as Peter says, we're not going to give any guidance on what we might do over the course of this year. With respect to COGS, we don't give real guidance in terms of what specifically is locked. What I will say is that in the marketplace, you are seeing the pressure from some of the brewing materials and continued fuel pressure, I mean, that's publicly available data. What is important is that you just reflect on the mix and how that's impacting our business. So I don't think you see as much volatility in parts of our business because of our hedging. We will be subjected to these broad inflationary pressures, which we haven't baked into the COGS numbers that we've given you. And because of the mix differential in our various businesses, so, for example, Canada uses a high percentage of returnable packaging, whereas the U.S. is almost all nonreturnable packaging. That's the reason we give you COGS by the year to help you model that.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in the queue. I turn the call back over to Mr. Swinburne for closing remarks.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thank you, Martina. And thank you, everybody, for your interest in Molson Coors and for the questions.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Molson Coors Brewing Company 2012 First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] ", "Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thank you, Steve. Hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Stewart Glendinning, Molson Coors' CFO; Dave Perkins, COO of Molson Coors Canada; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, President, Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors' Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.", "On the earnings call today, Stewart and I will take you through highlights of our quarter 1 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with additional perspective regarding our pending acquisition of the StarBev brewing business and our outlook for the balance of the year. In the first quarter, underlying earnings per share grew 9.3% on positive beer pricing and sales mix, continued cost savings initiatives and stock repurchases in the second half of last year.", "Underlying gross margin, including MillerCoors, increased 10 basis points from a year ago in the quarter, while underlying operating margin was unchanged at 9%.", "The U.S. posted a strong quarter, with underlying earnings growing nearly 17%, while the U.K. and Canada, underlying pretax income declined from a year ago. The U.S. benefited from its strongest NSR per hectoliter quarter in 3 years and drove significant cost savings to the bottom line. In Canada and the U.K., we faced margin pressure from higher pension and input inflation, as well as increased marketing investments in the U.K. and cycling onetime costs in Canada.", "Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a number of new line extensions. Within our core brand portfolio, Coors Light sales to retail grew more than 4% in the quarter driven by volume growth and market share gains in Canada, the U.S. and the U.K.  Most of the Canadian STRs increased to the low-single digit rate in Canada. We recently expanded Molson Canadian Lager into Quebec and have begun full national activation of our NHL sponsorship.", "Miller Lite declined low-single digits but did receive revitalized brand messaging, new advertising creative and an even higher level of engagement with multicultural audiences across the U.S. beginning in March. We have been rolling out this new programming over the past few weeks, and the initial feedback from distributors and the retail trade has been very positive. ", "Carling declined at a mid-single digit rate, reflecting the competitive U.K. market as 2011 consumer buying ahead of the 2012 price rise. We drove growth in our premium brands, including Rickard\u2019s, Creemore and Granville Islands in Canada; Blue Moon and Leinenkugel in the U.S.; and Cobra and Doom Bar in the U.K.", "On the innovation front, we introduced Coors Light Iced T to Canadian consumers in April. In the U.S., we introduced Leinenkugel Summer Shandy and the Coors Light aluminum pints. In the U.K., we launched Carling Zest, refreshing citrus beer with 2.8% alcohol, especially designed to appeal to a broad range of adult consumers. And obviously, the major impact of these launches will occur during the remainder of the year.", "The biggest news from Molson Coors in the first few months of 2012 was our agreement on April 3 to buy StarBev, the largest brewing business in central Europe, for EUR 2.65 billion or approximately USD $3.54 billion. This business generated 2011 sales of approximately $953 million and an EBITDA of $322 million under European Union IFRS. The purchase price represents a multiple of just under 11x EBITDA. StarBev brews 13.3 million hectoliters of beer annually and has the #1 brand in more than half of its markets, with strong positions in the rest.", "The acquisition of StarBev fits squarely into our strategy to increase our portfolio of premium brands and deepen our reach into growth markets around the world. The central European beer market is attractive, with strong historical trends and upside potential. StarBev is a market leader in the central European region, and this acquisition provides Molson Coors with a great platform for growth and an excellent foundation from which to extend our key brands, such as Carling, into central Europe.", "StarBev's international flagship brand, Staropramen, will also enhance our portfolio in some of our current unplanned markets. Investment levels behind the StarBev brands have been broadly appropriate, although we believe that a moderate increase is necessary to adequately support our planned innovation and brand strategy. Based on statutory tax rates, ranging from 10% to 20% in the 9 countries where StarBev does business, we expect our effective tax rates related to this business should be in the mid-teens. We'll update you at the appropriate time if this changes following the close.", "We have consistently said that making targeted acquisitions that expand our global presence and drive shareholder value is a key pillar for our growth strategy. We believe the acquisition of StarBev is financially compelling, that meets all of our return on capital requirements and is consistent with these goals.", "By way of an update, we are well along to completing this acquisition. We completed a public financing of $1.9 billion on May 3 and in the process, maintained our investment grade ratings. This debt issue was divided into tranches of $300 million for 5 years, $500 million for 10 years and $1.1 billion for 30 years, with very attractive coupons of 2%, 3.5% and 5%, respectively.", "When combined with the 0 coupon EUR 500 million convertible issued to the seller  on short duration low-rate bank financing, we expect the average coupon to be about 4% on a book basis and in the 3s on a cash basis. Thus, the only steps remaining prior to closing the transaction are regulatory clearance from the EU and Serbia. We expect to complete these steps and close the acquisition before the end of the second quarter.", "With that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Stewart to give first quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the balance of 2012. Stewart, over to you.", "S. F. Glendinning", "Thanks, Peter. Hello, everyone. First quarter financial highlights. On the bottom line, underlying after-tax income of $85.3 million or $0.47 per diluted share was 4.5% higher than a year ago, driven by positive beer pricing and sales mix across our company.  Underlying EPS increased 9.3%. Regionally, pretax equity income from MillerCoors drove our bottom line performance in the first quarter, with a 16.8% increase on the strength of solid pricing and sales mix, along with continuing cost reductions.", "With respect to the U.S., we also note that there's some timing impact of spending in marketing, which we expect to reverse in the balance of the year and especially in the second quarter. Canada results were negatively influenced by approximately $4 million of onetime benefits realized in the first quarter of 2011. In the U.K., increased marketing investment, weaker off-premise pricing, primarily driven by customer mix, combined with lower volumes and input inflation negatively impacted our results. In addition, both U.K. and Canada results were affected by increased defined benefit pension expense of $6.6 million in total. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 0.4% due to lower volume in the U.K. and Canada, partially offset by 24% STR growth in international. ", "For the first time, this quarter, I will provide some consolidated non-GAAP results that include our portion of MillerCoors. On this basis, total company net sales increased 1.9% in the first quarter driven by the U.S., Canada and international. Net sales per hectoliter increased 2.7% in the quarter, primarily due to solid pricing across our company and the addition of NAB contract brewing revenue in Canada.", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.5% due to input cost inflation, higher pension expense and the addition of contract brewing volume in Canada.  Input inflation accounted for more than 3/4 of the COGS increase and was largely driven by agricultural materials, packaging and fuel costs.", "Total company gross margin was 37.9%, 10 basis points higher than a year ago, primarily due to solid pricing. Marketing, general and administration expense increased 4% due to higher pension costs and non-core StarBev transaction expenses, along with increased brand investments in the U.K. and international and cycling onetime costs in Canada. Excluding non-core StarBev expenses and Canada onetime costs, the MG&A increase was only 1.5% in the quarter.", "Underlying operating margin was unchanged at 9%, with the increase in U.S. operating income offset by declines in Canada and the U.K. Please see the earnings release we distributed this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "It is important to note that our first quarter underlying earnings exclude some special and other non-core gains, losses and expenses that net to a $6.4 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "In the first quarter 2011, our Resources for Growth 2 cost reduction program delivered $10 million in savings for the quarter and a total of $136 million of savings since the program began over 2 years ago. Regarding cash uses, we did not repurchase shares during the first quarter due to the potential -- and we do not expect further purchases until our debt ratios are closer to pre-StarBev levels.", "Looking forward, regarding our 2012 guidance. We now expect our total company 2012 fund benefit pension expense to be approximately $70 million, including our portion of MillerCoors pension expense. This total expense is about $12 million higher than 2011 on an underlying basis, primarily due to lower long-term interest rates with higher expense in the U.K. and Canada offset by lower expense at MillerCoors.", "Meanwhile, we expect to -- we continue to expect total cash contributions to our pensions to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million this year, up from $50 million in 2011, due to increased contributions in Canada and MillerCoors in the U.S.", "Our outlook for capital spending, corporate interest expense, MG&A expense and corporate and effective tax rate have not changed from our last earnings call. Please note that all of these forward-looking statements exclude the StarBev business and related transaction and financing costs as the acquisition has not yet closed. We plan to update our outlook to include StarBev later in the year after we have closed and reported U.S. GAAP pro forma financial results for the business.", "Looking forward, there are a number of considerations for our balance of the year financial performance. Regarding our cost outlook, in Canada, for 2012, we continue to expect our all-in cost of goods sold to increase at a mid-single digit rate per hectoliter in local currency, with the result weighted toward the first half due to the cost of NAB contract volume being largely absent from the first half results last year. ", "In the U.S., we continue to expect liquids COGS per hectoliter to increase at a low-single digit rate for the full year 2012. In the U.K., we now expect our full year COGS per hectoliter to grow at a mid-single digit rate in local currency, down from high-single digits on our last earnings call. This change in expectation is primarily due to reduced sales forecast for low-margin beverage sales this year.", "Most of the annual COGS increase in the U.K. is expected in the second quarter due to planned brewery redevelopment costs. We expect this redevelopment to drive significant operations efficiencies in the years ahead.  We expect higher pension expense of about $15 million in Canada and $10 million in the U.K. For the balance of the year, we are investing incrementally in our brands and innovation to drive better performance in the years ahead. Marketing investments are planned to be about $30 million higher across Canada, the U.K. and international. Marketing spending will also be higher in the U.S. for the balance of the year.", "In other outlook, in the U.K., we expect the Europe football championships to accelerate volume from the third quarter to the second quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we don't anticipate any stock repurchases this year as we focus our cash use on paying down debt. Later this year, we'll be cycling lower employee incentive expense and the 53rd-week sales in Canada and the U.K. ", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for a regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Stewart. So in April, we rolled out Coors Light Iced T across Canada, and in June, our above-premium portfolio will be strengthened through the addition of the new Castle & Strongbow brands. In the U.S., we have strong marketing and sales programming behind our key brands this year, leading into the peak season, especially for Miller Lite, Coors Light and Miller 64. We are also introducing or testing a range of new brands, and we are rolling out a full slate of innovative packaging, including the Miller Lite punch top can to help build our existing brands. In the U.K., Carling Chrome and Carling Zest will receive increased marketing support, as will Coors Light to extend its current strong double-digit volume growth. ", "The 2012 investment in our International business will be similar to last year, with phasing buyers to the first half of the year. Our overriding international goal remains to build this group of businesses quickly and to reduce some investment per hectoliter so that our international group becomes a significant contributor to total company profitability by 2015.", "Finally, the following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In Canada, our sales to retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter declined at a mid-single digit rate versus 2011. In the U.S. for the 4 weeks ended April 28, STRs declined to a low-single digit rate on a trading day adjusted basis. In the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a high single-digit rate. And in the first 4 weeks, our international STRs have increased at a low double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "So when we measured our first quarter against the 3 pillars of our strategy that we laid out for the first time at our investors in New York last year, we have grown profitability in our core markets but only because of an exceptional quarter in the U.S. While the Canada market showed signs of improvement, we need to improve our gross profit margins. And while we've increased share in the U.K., the issue remains one of market performance. International growth is in line with our plan, and we expect the acquisition of StarBev to improve our growth market exposure while delivering returns that will grow shareholder value. And as discussed in New York, our primary focus continues to be on the improvement of total shareholder returns in our core business.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, 2 quick comments. Firstly, our prepared remarks will be on the website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. And that call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. ", "Second point I would just like to reference is that we did announce some personnel changes today, namely that Mark Hunter will be moving from the U.K. to when the StarBev business subject to satisfactory close and regulatory improvement (sic) [approval]. Stewart Glendinning, CFO, will be moving to the U.K. and Ireland business; and Gavin Hattersley will be moving from our U.S. business to join us as CFO of Molson Coors.", "I would just like to congratulate all 3 of those on the moves, which are heavily deserved. And so with that, I would like now to open it up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First, just in terms of Canada, so in Q1, you're down 0.5%. But competitively, it looks like you lost market share. So first, maybe you can talk about the competitive performance and how would you sort of assess your market share performance in Q1. And then just in terms of the April trend being down mid-single digit, how much of Q1 strength was sort of weather-driven? And why do you think April weakened, understanding that month-to-month there could be some volatility there?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "This goes to you, Dave.", "David Perkins", "Judy, yes, let me cover the different aspects, and let me start first with industry performance in Q1. On our fiscal basis, it was up about 1.3%. If you look at it on a calendar basis, it was up over 3%. Weather was certainly a positive factor during the quarter. Timing of Easter accelerated some volume from Q2 into Q1. And so it's our third consecutive quarter of industry growth now, so we're actually feeling good about that. We actually look like we outpaced the total beverage alcohol category in Q1 as well, so some positive things on the industry. But I do want to acknowledge the role of Easter and weather in that. On our market share performance and specifically, Judy, Coors Light, Molson Canadian both grew in the quarter, as did our above-premium portfolio. Our nonstrategic brands declined consistent with what I talked about last quarter, but that was largely offset by strategic brand growth everywhere but the West. And it's in the West that our share decline was concentrated. In the West, we achieved really strong NSR per hectoliter growth as we moved our value brands up and we shifted our promotional activity to less costly packs. But there's no doubt that came at the expense of share and volume, so we're just rebalancing that now. And as we look to April then in the mid-single digit decline in volume, I would say that Easter would certainly be a consideration in that with the acceleration to Q1. We had very cold weather in our major Eastern markets through the month. And I would say that our price competitiveness in the West, the factors I just talked about continue on into April and will likely continue on the early part of May as well.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So Dave, just following up on that. So I guess, can you maybe quantify how much non-strategic brands were down? And kind of how should we think about that portion of your portfolio just in terms of as you see the decline in those brands shouldn't we see better maybe pricing and better profitability? And I understand Q1, there's a lot of noise in the COGS line. But it seems like maybe you're not getting sort of the benefit of decline in some of the nonstrategic brands that you -- at the profit line.", "David Perkins", "Yes, I mean, the decline of the nonstrategic brands, I think the important thing to understand about those brands is they're actually quite profitable because there's low levels of support on them. They tend to have NSR similar to our mainstream brands, but at the bottom line, the contribution is quite strong. Really, the challenge for us, and I think I mentioned this the last quarter as well, is for us to get both innovation and core brands growing at a rate that it more than offsets what's happening on our nonstrategic brands. Nonstrategic brands would be in and around 10% of our total business, and there's nothing that we want to do by way of attention there to try to prop them up. It's really about leaning hard into our strategic brands. That's what we're doing. I think other than the challenge we've had in the West, pretty happy with what I've seen east of the Manitoba border in Q1.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the StarBev acquisition, maybe just taking a step back and talk more just from an organizational capability perspective because, obviously, Molson Coors have gone through some mergers and acquisitions with Molson and others. And I'm just wondering just based on your experience just looking back, some of the lessons that you've learned in sort of identifying what the right level of marketing spend, why do you think that the marketing investments in the StarBev business is appropriate and whether we should really not expect an even bigger step-up in terms of the brand investments. And you're making some personnel changes here, so any risk through -- as you're looking at the acquisition and some of the organizational changes and how you sort of keep the core business improving because that seems to be still your key focus. At the same time, you're obviously trying to implement this large-sized acquisition.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay, Judy. I'll try and answer all of that, if I can. Let me take the personnel and organization changes first. We're in very fortunate position to be able to announce the changes that we've made. There's obviously very capable people. The reality is that I could have chosen at least another 3 or 6 people to have done those roles. And the one thing I think we have done over recent years is build  up a huge strength of depth -- strength in depth, I'm sorry, of people. Now that goes to the overall teams as well. So as a leader of the business, I have to make sure that if anything happens to any of our business unit leaders, be it Dave, Mark or anyone else, in some sort of crisis that we've got people to come step in, but also teams below them, that are very, very capable of running the business, and that's what we have. So as far as the existing business is concerned, I'm absolutely confident that, that will be -- we won't miss a heartbeat. As far as the StarBev business is concerned, I think we mentioned when we made the acquisition that we are very impressed with the management team over there. I have been over there to speak to all of the management team. And even this morning, we were on a call, and the message there, very clearly, is business as usual. So again, with Mark moving over to lead that business, I don't think we'll miss a heartbeat. Their plans are laid out. We know what they're plans are. We went through their plans in due diligence. We've got strong belief in their plans, and everybody needs to achieve them. So really, I think that's the strength as far as we are concerned. And as you say we've been to this process quite a few times in recent years. Specifically, on the marketing spend, we did, as you would expect, a huge amount of due diligence market by market, brand by brand. And obviously, one of the things that we looked at was the relative spend of the StarBev business against the competitive bench and also, the performance of brands by market. And based on that, we made some assessments, which, we think, are very realistic about how we would need to put behind the brands. And this is really market by market. It's not a layer approach. It's very specific to brands by market. And so again, we're very confident that the numbers that we have in are the correct amount, and we don't believe there'll be any need to increase them. Did that answer your question?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Peter or Dave, could give us an update on how Coors Light Iced T is going in Canada and where you're headed on the opportunity for that innovation in the U.S.?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I'll take the second part. Well, no, actually, what I'll -- Tom, do you want to take the second part of that -- the front, and then we'll pass it on to Dave?", "Tom Long", "Sure. We're watching the rollout of Coors Light Iced T very carefully and, of course, we borrow with no pride at all. We're eager to find successful products across the country, and Coors Light Iced T in Canada is a great innovation that we're watching carefully. So we would be prepared to launch it given the success, and as if we learn about how the drinker base works, so we're watching that closely.", "David Perkins", "Again, Mark, it's Dave. It's not a very robust update to give. I'm -- we're in full distribution now. Above the line marketing support started April 23. So it's quite recent. Certainly, all the indications that we're getting in the early days are positive. We're seeing the numbers come in where we'd hoped to. We're achieving the pricing that we'd hoped to on the brand. It is very early days.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then, I wonder, Peter, if you could just talk sort of philosophically about marketing spend as we think beyond 2012, you're going to own StarBev. You've called out, for 2 quarters now, the intention to really up the level of spend in markets other than in the United States. So as you think about how you prioritize spend, I guess, my 2 questions are, it seems like the U.S. is a lagger at least in 2012 in terms of rate of increase. So it that something we should view as kind of a strategic statement? Or is it just kind of an anomaly for the year? How are you thinking about how you allocate these dollars on a multi-geography basis?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Well, I think over the full year -- or can I let the U.S. team speak to it. We are looking -- we will be looking to increase marketing spend from hereon in, so Q1 shouldn't be an indicator of the future. And I think, Tom and the team talked about this morning but I'll let them jump in later on if they want to. As far as this year and looking forward is concerned, Mark, the -- we really tried to link this year's increased expenditure to 2 things: one was an increased innovation pipeline. We see that innovation pipeline being pretty full for 3 years, and so we would see this is a rebate, if you like, looking forward. But also, some of that money will also go on our core brands. So I think we've got to a level this year where we want to get it to you looking forward. As an indicator, obviously, that will move around at the margins plus or minus X%, obviously. But that would be really the way we're thinking about it. Shawn, do you want to add anything on the U.S.?", "Unknown Executive", "No, I don't think so. I think that captures our position, Peter.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And to my -- and I mean, the number as I understand it, the percentage increases are much more dramatic outside the U.S. even once you factor in the full year plans for the U.S. Is that a fair understanding? And can you just speak to that as an indication of priorities by region?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Well, I don't believe such priorities. I mean, it will be much a higher percentage because the U.S. base is considerably higher than either the U.K. or Canada. If you look at our marketing expenditure as a percentage of turnover, I think you'll find that we're trying to catch up in some of the other geographies compared to the U.S. So I think overall, we're in a pretty good position geography by geography.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JPMorgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "In general, Eastern Europe is viewed as somewhat of an emerging market. And I guess, the only issue becomes with beer, you've got much higher per capita consumption to start with. So can you talk about sort of how we should view the development of Eastern Europe from a beer standpoint? And as we look at your growth expectations going forward, where can per capita consumption go? Where can pricing go? Where can market share go because most of these countries, at this point, seem relatively well developed?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "John, a couple of things. I think the per capita consumption does vary country by country, and we are in actually 9 different countries. So that's the first point I would make. Everything that we've seen in these countries because as you say that's somewhat emerging markets reflects the fact that the per capita consumption is -- there is a very, very strong correlation between that and GDP growth. And so you have take a view on what's going to happen to the GDP growth in these countries. And yes, it's going to be volatile. But over the -- if you average it out, looking forward over the next 5 to 10 years, we see that is a positive trend. And so really that's the background to it.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So I guess, if you look at this, can you talk about, then maybe getting down to some of the more specific countries within the StarBev acquisition Czech, obviously, very high per capita consumption, low market share there. Where do you line up well in terms of maybe high market share and growing per capita consumption or high per capita consumption and low market share? Just trying to understand where the opportunities are.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, I think it's probably in terms of detail because we're talking about 9 countries and a multiplicity of brands, Dave can pick the real detail on that later on. But if I was to give you a background, I mean, as I mentioned, we have got the #1 brand in 5 of the markets that we're talking about. And within that 5, there are a good number where we see opportunity to continue to grow our market share position or certainly hold it and improve value around that piece and also see improvements within the overall velocity of the market. So we're comfortable that there is opportunity. It does vary market by market, but Dave can take you to the detail about later on, if you like.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "You're talking about being less price competitive in the West than Canada. Can you talk about you got there? Was it discounting? Or do you take price up and it wasn't followed? And then finally, is it safe to assume that since you talked about -- not to put words in your mouth, but basically rolling back on price, should we see the price decelerate over the back end of the year or is there an offset?", "David Perkins", "Yes, okay. In the West, what we did is we moved our value brands up certainly at a rate higher than the rest of the market in any of the GPIs. So we're trying to close the gap between our value brands and our mainstream. In addition, a lot of the promotional activity in the West is happening in fairly expensive SKUs, and so we attempted to shift that to less costly SKUs. That worked in part, but it didn't work the way we wanted it to because it wasn't the general market move, and we haven't seen the market move that way. So we're finding ourselves less competitive now, and that's why we're rolling back. In terms of the impact it will have on NSR, going forward, I wouldn't characterize is as particularly material on a national basis. Certainly, in the West, it will have some impact.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Do -- can I just follow up? On the value brands, you moved up and did -- is it fair to say competition didn't follow?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. We found ourselves uncompetitive after having moved up, so our value brands ended up above the market.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. First, I just want to make sure I understood the pension expense increase correctly. It's going to be -- it's a 1,200 million -- or I'm sorry, $12 million incremental expense relative to last year. Is that just for the U.K. and Canada or that's including the offset from the U.S.?", "S. F. Glendinning", "No, that includes the offset from the U.S.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So it's -- the U.K. and Canada, specifically, are $25 million higher combined?", "S. F. Glendinning", "Yes, that's correct, $25 million combined.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "All right. And then -- so the $6.5 million of higher pension costs that you referenced earlier in the call is just the U.K. and Canada, right? That matches -- that's basically phasing in the $25 million in the U.K. and Canada?", "S. F. Glendinning", "That's correct. That's $6.6 million just for the first quarter.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And so -- okay. And then, I guess, more broadly, as you went into this year in your core markets, basically, the expectation or the plan is to basically drive more volume growth in order to drive the P&L. And I guess, you factored out the weather in the U.S. in the first quarter, which helped in the U.S. and maybe to an extent it helped in Canada as well. Is there anything just in terms of the overall environment that has changed your thinking at all in terms of your ability to do that? Is the consumer any better or worse than it was when you set your original plan? Just want to try and get a sense for how you feel about your plans and sort of what the environment's willing to give in terms of a more volume-driven plan.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. So I mean, obviously, not just volume, it's balancing the volume with the NSR growth, what we've been trying to do, Bryan. But if I try and encapsulate it, I would say that we have been, all things being equal, probably pleasant, cautiously pleasantly surprised with the U.S. and Canada. The markets are probably even better than we expected. To be honest, no idea whether that will continue, but that's what we would say, and probably the U.K. is being the same as we expected, which is difficult. So that's some of it. I mean, before April, I think we would've been a bit more positive, but you've seen the numbers in April, and so it really reflects consumer trends at the moment. It's pretty volatile, to be honest with you. But overall, yes, I think Canada and U.S. is probably more positive than we expected.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And fairly characterize that you'd be effective -- the first quarter didn't really see a full effect of all of the marketing and product innovation that you've got planned. I mean, it's part of driving the NSR. So I mean, we're not really seeing the effect of what you're investing to drive that better revenue growth. Is that fair characterization?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, absolutely fair to say that marking it both from a marketing investment line on our core brands but also from innovation. Really, we should see the major benefit of that in the remaining of the year -- remainder of the year.", "S. F. Glendinning", "So Bryan, I would just add to that by saying that, of course, the first quarter is a slower quarter than any of the others. And second, as Peter highlighted, a good deal of our investment has gone behind new innovation. And as always, that innovation has some ramp-up period that there's a part for you to consider.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just finally, Peter, that -- I guess, since the StarBev acquisition was announced, the stock is -- your stock has underperformed. And I guess, if I can encapsulate, I guess, there was a disconnect in terms of what you're seeing in terms of the value in StarBev versus what maybe the market was hoping for, whether that was a dividend or a bigger share repurchase or some other use of the capital. Can you just talk to how you viewed that difference in terms of where the value lies in StarBev relative to doing those other kind of capital return options?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, I mean, what I can say, Bryan, is that really over the last 3 years plus, we've consistently examined with our board the best way to use any cash that we have at any point in time. And we've always judged the usage of that cash against total shareholder return in the medium to long term. And as we announced a year ago, it was appropriate to use that cash for share buybacks because there was no other option on the table when StarBev came up. It was an option at the price that we bought it at, which was below 11x EBITDA multiple. It really satisfied all the financial criteria we laid out and both in our estimation and the board agreed, so over the medium to long term, that was a better way to use our cash. It will be much easier to talk about StarBev in the fine detail when we actually own the business. But you understand, at the moment, we're bound by confidentiality. So I think a lot more will become clear when we'll be able to talk in more detail as to our beliefs and our rationale. So I'd ask you just to be patient on that for a little bit longer.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of James Watson with HSBC.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on Canada and the market share loss. I was actually surprised when you said that the nonstrategic brands were kind of had a similar profitability, similar bottom line effect. I wanted to find out what -- how you guys define your strategic versus nonstrategic brands? And are you okay with the share loss assuming that it's all in nonstrategic brands and your strategic brands are maintaining or gaining share?", "David Perkins", "Yes, okay. Let me take a crack at that, James. I mean, the way we define a strategic brand is essentially one that we're investing behind to maintain or grow for the future. And there's about a dozen brands that would fall into that camp. The nonstrategic brands are brands that were either fully harvesting or that we may be spending a little bit on to moderate the decline in some cases. But generally, they're harvest brands. And for us, what's important is really to have a stable to growing market share over time. I mean, we want a portfolio that is capable of ensuring that we're competitive within the category. And so it's important to us that our supported brands, our strategic brands do get to a point where they're fully offsetting and more than offsetting the decline of those nonstrategic brands. Now some of our strategic brands also have premium, above-premium pricing. You know that we have a strong above-premium portfolio. But even if you look at our innovation like Coors Light Iced T, that is coming in at an above-mainstream pricing, an above-premium pricing. And so that will have a beneficial impact on our NSR and on our margins.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "So that's something where even if the share losses coming from lack of the nonstrategic, we should still be seeing kind of mix benefits and gains through higher-priced brands?", "David Perkins", "Yes. I mean, over the longer term, what we're attempting to do on our portfolio is ensure that the kind of segment shifts the we see happening in the market don't disadvantage us. So over time, we see the mainstream segment declining, the above-premium increasing and the value segment tends to vary. Generally, it has trended up, but there are times when you'll see it reverse itself. We need to have fair share within each of those 3 pricing segments so that as the market shifts, it doesn't mathematically cause our market share to decline. And then within the portfolio, we want to push the premium-ization. Premium-ization is the growth of the above-premium segment, but it is also the kind of innovation that we do in the mainstream segment. So I don't consider Coors Light Iced T a true above-premium brand, but it is commanding a price index that is very attractive to us. And so within the mainstream, to the extent that we can push towards higher priced products, we will.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "So is it fair to say that your marketing investment kind of matches your outlook there in terms of above-premium being higher growth so you'd have a little bit over-index if in terms of marketing on that segment?", "David Perkins", "That would be fair, although I would emphasize that the investment that we make behind Coors Light and Canadian, which are our power brands that are absolutely critical to keeping our breweries running and maintaining our bottom line, get very healthy investment.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back for any closing comments.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Thanks, Steve, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today and for your interest in the business. And we look forward to speaking to you again at the end of our next quarter. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

This is a reasonable multiple for a business with a good long-term growth profile and we expect it will be earnings-accretive in the first full year. Poor February weather and local FX impacted first half results, but the business delivered strong market share growth and recent performance is in line with our expectations.", "For 2011, Central Europe pro forma results under U.S. GAAP included net sales of $940 million, an underlying pretax income of $182 million, the underlying EBITDA of $317 million. Gross margins as a percent of net sales was 44.2%, underlying EBITDA margin was 33.8% and underlying operating margin was 19.3%. These results confirm that the business has a solid margin structure on which to grow.", "We financed the acquisition with $2.8 billion of new debt at very low interest rates along with more than $600 million cash in hand. We are taking immediate steps to capture $50 million in annualized pretax operational synergies by 2015, and we expect the purchase of our new Central Europe business to drive positive returns for shareholders towards the early part of the 3- to 5-year range that we used to evaluate significant investments.", "In terms of what Central Europe brings operationally to Molson Coors, this business sold 13.3 million hectoliters of beer last year and has the #1 brand in more than half of its markets with strong positions in the rest.", "On a pro forma basis, for 2011, Central Europe makes up 22.7% of our worldwide volume, 12.3% of net sales including MillerCoors and 16.2% of underlying operating profit.", "We now own the worldwide brand rights to Staropramen which is growing strongly in many of the 30 countries where it is sold. In a number of markets, we have licensing or distribution agreements with third parties for Staropramen and other brands and we expect these to continue under the same conditions as prior to the transaction.", "We also see opportunity to increase our Central Europe market share through branding and packaging innovations, including introducing Molson Coors brands like Carling.", "In summary, our first couple of months with this business confirm that this acquisition fits squarely into our strategy to increase our portfolio of premium brands and deepen our reach into growth markets around the world. The Central European market is attractive with strong historical trends and upside potential. Our Central Europe business is a market leader in the region and this acquisition provides Molson Coors with a great platform for growth.", "Shifting gears now to our second quarter financial results for Molson Coors. Underlying after-tax income for the second quarter 2012 increased 8% to $250 million, driven by positive performance in our U.S. business and the inclusion of 2 weeks of Central Europe results in 2012. Underlying earnings per share increased 12.2% to $1.38, which includes the benefits of 2 weeks of Central Europe results and fewer shares outstanding this year. Gross margin including MillerCoors declined from a year ago while underlying operating margin increased.", "Regionally, the U.S. had a good quarter, but the U.K. and International businesses reported lower underlying earnings. In Canada, we grew earnings in local currency, but this was offset by negative foreign exchange in our reported U.S. dollar results. Central Europe pro forma pretax earnings declined in the second quarter, but outperformed the industry. Based on the macroeconomic environment in Europe, we see some industry-related risk to our near-term performance, but we have encountered no negative surprises in the business and current performance is in line with our expectations. Gavin will provide additional financial highlights in a minute.", "In brands, second quarter Coors Light sales to retail grew 4% with solid volume and market share growth in all of our regions. Most of Canadian trademark STRs in Canada grew in the quarter. Miller Lite declined low single digits while showing incremental trend improvement versus the first quarter. The Carling brand declined in a weak U.K. economy that also suffered its wettest April to June period on record. Our Central Europe brands grew 1.4% on a pro forma basis.", "In innovation, the launch of Coors Light Iced T in Canada has delivered strong consumer awareness and trial and is performing in line with our expectations. In the U.S., the Coors Light Aluminum Pint and Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy are consistently exceeding expectations. In a depressed U.K. beer market, the launch of Carling Zest has exceeded our expectations with this new brand picking up listings in most of the major grocery chains.", "With that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Gavin to give second quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the second half of 2012. Gavin?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. In second quarter financial highlights, Molson Coors second quarter underlying earnings increased 8% to $250.1 billion while earnings per share increased 12.2% to $1.38 per share. The addition of Central Europe results drove approximately 40% of the increase in underlying earnings per share. The Central Europe impact is made up of $19.7 million of underlying pretax income in the last 2 weeks of the quarter, partially offset by $5 million of acquisition-related interest expense in corporate.", "Regionally, MillerCoors has contributed a positive underlying profit performance in the quarter with a 7.2% increase, driven by continued solid pricing and cost reductions. In Canada, positive volume, pricing and cost reductions are offset by negative foreign currency in the quarter. The U.K. had a challenging quarter due to lower volumes, increased marketing and pension expense.", "Now, a note about how we are presenting our results following the Central Europe acquisition. In order to provide the most useful information, our discussion regarding Central Europe will center on pro forma results for both this year and the comparable prior year period. A discussion of consolidated, Canada, U.K., International and corporate results will be on the same basis as before StarBev.", "So on a pro forma basis, Central Europe underlying pretax income in the second quarter declined 37% driven by unfavorable foreign currency, channel and geographic mix along with higher input costs and brand investments.", "Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased 6.4% due to the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe results. Excluding Central Europe, worldwide volume decreased 1% driven by lower volume in the U.K. and U.S., partially offset by growth in International and Canada.", "As we did last quarter, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionally consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business.", "On this basis, total company net sales increased 5.7% in the second quarter driven by the U.S., Canada and International. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 0.8% in the quarter due to the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe sales at a lower NSR per hectoliter, which more than offset solid pricing in the U.S. and Canada and the addition of NAB contract brewing revenue in Canada.", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 0.4% due to input cost inflation, higher pension expense and the addition of contract brewing volume in Canada.", "Total company gross margin was 41.5%, 70 basis points lower than a year ago primarily due to the U.K. and International performance.", "Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 8.2% due to the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe results including acquisition-related costs, higher pension expense, increased brand investments in Canada and International and cycling lower employee incentive costs in Canada last year.", "Underlying operating margin was 17.2%, up from 16.9% a year ago due to margin growth in the U.S. and the addition of 2 weeks of Central Europe operating income this year.", "Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier in the morning for a detailed review of a our business unit financial results in the quarter including for Central Europe on a comparable pro forma basis. It's important to note that our second quarter underlying results excludes some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to $178.9 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to the Central Europe acquisition and financing and are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "In the second quarter of 2012, our Resources for Growth cost reduction program delivered $14 million in savings and a total of $150 million in savings since the program began over 2 years ago. As a result, we have achieved our 3-year RFG2 program target of $150 million 6 months early. MillerCoors achieved cost savings of $32 million in the quarter and we benefit from 42% of those cost savings.", "Underlying free cash flow for the first half of this year was $335 million. This $213 million increase over last year was primarily driven by year-over-year change in the timing of working capital. Our first half cash generation was made up of the following: $397 million of operating cash flow, which includes $305 million from MillerCoors plus $125 million of net add-backs for acquisition-related costs, purchases and sales of businesses and other assets.", "Cash outflows were $81 million of capital spending and $106 million of cash invested in MillerCoors. Regarding cash uses, we did not repurchase shares during the second quarter. And as we mentioned when we announced our Central Europe acquisition in April, we do not expect further repurchases until our debt ratios are closer to pre-acquisition levels.", "Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $4.9 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $516 million, resulting in net debt of $4.4 billion.", "Looking forward, we are updating our 2012 guidance in a number of areas principally because of the Central Europe acquisition. We now expect our 2012 MG&A expense in corporate to be approximately $135 million. This guidance includes about $35 million of acquisition-related fees and expenses, which we estimate will be less than $5 million in the second half of this year. We now expect full year 2012 underlying corporate interest expense to be approximately $115 million based on current foreign exchange rates and excluding underlying adjustments.", "The new debt used to help fund the Central Europe acquisition currently carries a weighted average interest rate of about 3%.", "Our 2012 capital spending outlook is approximately $240 million for the full year. This $40 million increase from previous guidance is driven by second half capital spending in Central Europe. Note that this capital spending guidance excludes MillerCoors' capital expenditure. We currently expect annual capital spending in Central Europe to be in the range of EUR 80 million to EUR 90 million for the next 2 years and moderately lower after that.", "Over the medium term, we will be focusing on reducing our leverage. However, we remain committed to our existing capital allocation strategy and maintaining a strong dividend for our shareholders.", "As far as our cost outlook is concerned, in Canada, for 2012, we are now expecting our all-in cost of goods sold to increase in the high single-digit rate per hectoliter in the local currency, up from mid-single digits on our last earnings call. This increase in forecast is driven by a mix shift towards higher-cost packages and products including Strongbow and Newcastle.", "In the U.S., we continue to expect MillerCoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year of 2012.", "In Central Europe, we anticipate a low single-digit increase in pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency, driven by agricultural commodities, utilities and fuel inflation.", "In the U.K., we now expect our full year cost of goods sold per hectoliter to grow at a high single-digit rate in local currency, driven by input inflation, sales mix, pension costs and onetime expenses related to the U.K. brewery improvement this year. We expect additional pension expense this year of about $15 million in Canada and $10 million in the U.K.", "For the balance of the year, we are investing incrementally in our brands and innovation to drive growth in the years ahead. Marketing investments are planned to be higher in Canada, U.K. and International. MillerCoors also plans incremental investments in the U.S. for the balance of the year. In Central Europe, after a double-digit increase in marketing and sales spending behind our innovation agenda in the first half, we plan more moderate local currency increases in the second part of this year.", "In other outlook. At current levels, we expect foreign exchange to have a negative impact on second half 2012 profit of approximately $3 million in Canada, entirely driven by the third quarter and approximately $25 million in Central Europe on a pro forma basis, primarily driven by the third quarter.", "Also in Canada, in the third quarter, we expect a reversal of the second quarter volume benefit from the timing of the Canada Day holiday. In the fourth quarter, we will cycle the 53rd week in our fiscal 2011 year, which provided approximately $12 million of additional pretax income in Canada last year.", "And in the U.K., in the third quarter, we will be cycling a reduction in employee incentive compensation expense last year. This will have a negative impact in our results in the third quarter of about $6 million.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. So in Canada, we continue to roll out our Coors Light Iced T and have launched Aluminum Pints for Coors Light and Molson Canadian. We also acquired the license for Newcastle Brown Ale and the Strongbow Cider in Canada and managed the pricing volume mix in the west to better balance our market share performance.", "In the U.S., we have strong marketing and sales programming behind our key brands this year in peak season especially for Miller Lite, Coors Light and Miller64. We are also introducing or testing a range of new brands and we continue to leverage a full slate of innovative packaging including the Miller Lite punch top can to help build on existing brands.", "In Central Europe, our results were impacted by a negative foreign exchange and upfront investment behind innovations and marketing efforts ahead of the peak season this year from which we expect strong returns in the second half. These innovations include lemon and grapefruit extensions of some of our leading brands. These line extensions and new packages have been growing strongly this summer and are pulling volume from inside the beer category and from other types of beverages. Additionally, following expansion last year, Staropramen is growing strongly in Central Europe and in our export markets. As a result, we are optimistic that our Central Europe trends in local currency will improve in the second half.", "In the U.K., we plan to invest in marketing and in our Sharp's Brewery to increase capacity in order to support the strong growth of Doom Bar, which has been the fastest-growing cask ale in the U.K. for the past 3 years. The 2012 investment in our International business will be moderately higher than last year.", "Finally, the following are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter declined at a mid-single-digit range versus 2011 and this was related to the year-over-year shift of the Canada Day holiday. In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended July 28, STRs were in line with the prior year. In Central Europe, our sales volumes increased to the high single-digit range for the first month of the quarter. And in on the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a mid-single-digit rate. In the first 4 weeks, our International STRs have increased at a low double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "So to summarize our discussions today. We've completed an important acquisition that we expect to strengthen our company, enhance our growth profile and increase shareholder value in a relatively short time frame. Increased net sales and NSR per hectoliter on an apples-to-apples basis on solid pricing and we sustained moderate gross margin compression, which we are addressing. We also continue to invest in our key brands and innovation across the business, and most important, on an underlying basis, we grew operating margins, earning per share and free cash flow in the quarter. The markets in which we operate remain tough, but we are taking and will continue to take aggressive steps to drive long-term value for our shareholders.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. And also as usual at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "So at this point, Martina, we would like to open it up to -- for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So first, just on the Central Europe because obviously it's the first time we're seeing the pro forma results here. So if I just look at the profit weakness in 2Q, it sounds like the -- it really came a lot from the COGS inflation being much higher. So can you just walk us through in terms of what the -- how much of that was kind of industry-wide issue? And based on your comment, it sounds like you're expecting the COGS per hectoliter to improve in the back half? Why are you expecting that to happen? And then some of the negative geographic and channel mix that you've talked about in 2Q, if you can just go through that in a little bit more detail?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, I'll let Mark take you through the detail, Judy. But I think, really, as far as our perspective on the business that we've acquired and what we've seen of it, everything that's happened is either due to strategic business decisions which we support, which will be -- which will give us a good solid foundation for the second half of the year and/or just stuff that's happened in the market regarding weather, which is being quite difficult but that was in the first quarter. So Mark, do you want to take us through a bit more detail?", "Mark Hunter", "Sure. Really -- let me give you a little bit of context then talk about the specific on COGS. So I think what we've seen in the business has been very impressive and very much in line with our expectations around the quality of the people, the brands, the focus and execution and the discipline and leanness of the business. And certainly, in the first half of the year, following a very, very soft February driven by very poor weather across Central Europe, the business decision to invest aggressively ahead of the peak selling season, so we've seen a significant increase in sales and marketing investment, significant increase in innovation and we've invested more heavily in customer relationships and customer trading and that certainly helped drive momentum in the business. As you heard Peter and Gavin mentioned, we've seen a high single-digit volume growth through July and that's, as you know, our peak selling season so I think those decisions have been well placed. As we've got to the end of the first half, volume run ahead of the market. Our market share is up. Our pricing is up. So for the first half, pricing is up by about 5% and that's more than compensating for any mix or discount activity in the marketplace. And then to your final point, COGS clearly have moved along kind of a high single-digit level in the first half. And to be fair, none of that is MCCE-specific. Most of it is industry-wide challenges around input cost inflation on things like malt, energy and fuel. So I don't think we're not seeing anything unusual in our COGS numbers. As we look to this -- towards the second half, we will be lapping some one-off costs associated with packaging changes and bottle changes in the second half of last year and that will have a dampening effect on COGS as we move through the second half of the year. So that's why we're confident that a high single-digit number will certainly come back through the second half of the year.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Just following up on that, Mark. Maybe can you give us some comfort around why you think that, that sort of the strategic investment step-up that you saw in 2Q was really just a one quarter situation that we're not going to continue to see sort of higher investment needed to drive better sales growth going forward? And then, it sounds like your comment about the business or the acquisition being accretive in the first year. So if you can just help us maybe quantify how much accretion you're assuming for 2013? And what are some of the assumptions that you have in your forecast to kind of get to that accretion number?", "Mark Hunter", "Well, I can certainly pick up the first part of the question and I'll ask Gavin or Peter to pick up the second part. With regard to the investments in the business, I mean, the industry in Central Europe in the first quarter was down over 3% in volume terms. And I think the leadership team here took a decision, which was do we either start trimming back on investment to deal with that volume softness or do we pool some of our investment from the second half towards the first half. That's a decision that was made and I believe it to be the right decision. So it's been very much a change in phasing of investment from second half to first half across sales and marketing and innovation and that's starting to pay dividends, a lot of the volume trends improvement that was seen through July. I think we said at the time of acquisition, we do see opportunities over the medium term to move the sales and marketing investment up, but what we've done is very much in the context of ensuring that the bottom line of our P&L moves in the right direction. So there are clearly opportunities on a market-by-market basis to further strengthen our position and we'll be taking those, but we will do that in the normal course of business. So I think you can look on the sales and marketing investment this year very much as a re-phasing of that spend for the right reasons. With regard to the accretion, Gavin or Peter, do you want to pick that up?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes, that's fine. Thanks, Mark. Look, Judy, we're not going to give earnings per share guidance or accretion numbers. What we have given you is our pro forma numbers and we've tried to give you some flavor around what's impacting those pro forma numbers going back and going forward. So that's as far as we can go on that question, Judy.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then my last question, just on Canada. So you had a pretty big step-up in terms of marketing spending in the quarter. It sounds like the share is still down a bit kind of on a year-over-year and then I don't know if the industry number has also weakened in the July, but July being down mid-single digits in terms of sales-to-retailer growth for Canada just also seems a little bit weaker. So Dave, maybe you can tell us kind of what you're seeing from a competitive environment and why don't you -- do you think that some of the investment that you're making is actually driving better share performance?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. Thanks, Judy. Let me take you through the shape of our share results in Q2. Let me start by brand. First of all, Coors Light trademark was up double digits. We had really strong trial on Iced T and the interesting thing is despite the strong trial, we saw the Coors Light brand, itself, up mid-single digits. So didn't seem to be any cannibalization on the surface there. If anything, there was a bit of a halo for the brand. So really pleased with what we saw in the Coors Light trademark. Obviously, the Iced T is at a premium price, as you know, so it would have had a premiumization effect for us. Canadian was up low-single digits and our above premium brands were strong for us through the quarter. Crafts were up double digits. Our domestic above premium, which would largely be Rickard's was up mid-single digit and the imports were up low single digit. Innovation in total, and remember that the step-up in our marketing investment would come into play here, was between 3 and 3.5 point. And again, with the premiumization effect from Iced T and from the growth of Molson Canadian is 67. What we saw in the quarter was something similar to Q1. Our share challenge was in Western Canada. That's where we lost share. What we did see in the quarter is better trends on our core brands, so Canadian and Coors Light. But we saw worsening trends in the value segment. And I think when you look at the mix of what's happened, that helps you understand why we had a very positive NSR result for the quarter. So where we were feeling the pain was really at the bottom end of the market, and premium and above doing very well for us. In terms of the competitive environment, I'd say very competitive market across the country both in terms of price and innovation. So we saw an awful lot of activity in the market. There was more beer that would have been sold on promotion than in prior quarters. I'd characterize the West as the most active market, but I think there was a step-up in Qu\u00e9bec as well that we saw. And despite that, we're really pleased with what we saw on our NSR per hectoliter where we're up about 3.3%. So we're not blindly chasing volume or share. We're making the right decisions, I think, to get the balance between value and volume. Does that help?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kaumil Gajrawala from UBS.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I want to follow up a little bit on the profit declines at StarBev. There was only, I guess, 2 weeks in your reported numbers. It sounds like some of the marketing decisions were tactical decisions, but that's a short period of time for such a big -- what sounds like a big swing in the strategy. So can you help maybe give some context on how big of an impact each one of these things had on the decline in profitability?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, just for clarity, the decline in profitability that we're talking about on a pro forma basis is for the first 6 months, not just for the 2 weeks. We only had the business for 2 weeks. And during that period of time, the business has performed absolutely in line with our expectations. So the main drivers, by far, are the ones that Mark has talked to. There's FX in that. There was very poor weather in February where literally accounts were closed and they couldn't deliver beer, which significantly affected the profits in that particular month. And also the decisions, the strategic decisions, that the team made locally to put money behind the brands in advance of the peak season and that has -- that's really been a, if you like, a movement of funding from the second half of the year into the first half of the year. But over the full year, the marketing expenditure will be much in line with what we expected.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And if maybe we could talk about Romania a little bit. I believe that's your largest market of all the new countries and it's been a market where the market share over the last couple of years has declined quite a bit. Is the marketing step-up getting allocated to a particular division? And how do you see your share trends progressing in Romania?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Well, again, I'll let Mark talk specifically about Romania. It's not our biggest market, either in volume or in profit terms. But Mark, you want to pick it up?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes. So, I mean, just to be clear, if you look at total industry volume and Romania clearly kind of leads the pack across Central Europe, we have a #3 position there. And my sense is as we conducted a current planning process, that we are growing in confidence with our ability to move that business forward. Now it won't be in 12 months, but I believe over the next 36 months we can, with the strength of our brand portfolio, expect to see an appropriate level of increased marketing spend, a broader commercial spend to be fair on an improvement in both our share trends and our bottom line performance. So if you look back over the last 3 to 5 years, this was a far, far more profitable and a larger market for the Central European business. My view is that we can regain a material proportion of that over the course of the next 3 years, but clearly beyond that, I'm not going to offer any detail at this stage.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could ask one financial question. You alluded to the focus on paying down debt. What would be your -- the target ratios that you want to hit before it would be appropriate to just begin considering a buyback again?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks, Kaumil. What we're trying to do -- it's Gavin here, what we're trying to do is get back to our pre-acquisition ratios that we had in place. And as we said at the time of acquisition, we would expect that to be in the next 2 to 3 years' time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "On -- I guess, Mark or Malcolm, it actually sounds like on a local currency basis -- this is also on StarBev, you expect things to actually improve quite a bit here in the second half. You've got pricing that has been positive. You've got volumes accelerating. Sounds like cost of sales per hectoliter decelerating. You said marketing spend is shifting from 2H or has shifted from 2H into 1H. Are you -- I guess, is that a fair understanding and it sounds like it actually translates into an expectation of EBITDA growth, local currency for StarBev in the second half.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Mark, I think you picked up all the data points accurately.", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, I think that's a very fair summary.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And when you said pricing up 5% for StarBev in the first half, was that inclusive of mix -- I think it was local currency, but can you speak to net sales per hectoliter inclusive of mix?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, in the second quarter, unit pricing was up 5% and then mix and discount activity that took about 3% of that, so it gave us a net position of about 2% growth in the second quarter. And that's pretty similar for the first half in total.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay, similar. Okay, great. And then finally, if we try to tease out FX in the first half, can you give you us some sense of what EBITDA did in terms of rate of decline or maybe gross profit, some metric. We're trying to tease out the underlying business performance in the first half?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Mark, this is Gavin here. From a second point of view in Central Europe, about 1/3 of that decline was related to FX, a little over $9 million.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And the EBITDA -- and that's at the EBITDA line?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes.", "Mark Hunter", "And Mark, just to clarify that. That $9 million is at the operating income level. The FX impact on EBITDA is actually more significant than that.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Can you give us some magnitude difference?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, so it's probably about $15 million impact at the EBITDA line and about $9 million at the operating income line.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And these are -- both those numbers are translation?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, that's correct.", "David Dunnewald", "And Mark, this is Dave Dunnewald. For a clarification or just looking at the relative size of the -- going from operating to EBITDA, if you look at the size of the depreciation and amortization, you'll see the kind of ratio that Mark just alluded to when he gave you those numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on Mark's question. In terms of FX, what was the effect on -- well, I guess, first, in terms of the outlook you gave, the $25 million impact in the second half, is that on operating income or on EBITDA?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "It's on pretax, Bryan.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Pretax profit?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, what was the effect in the first quarter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "It was pretty flat at a pretax level, Bryan.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, okay. And then in terms of your outlook for the year, just on FX, there's no -- is that a fixed -- have you done anything to hedge foreign currency at all, or is there a chance that the number would float around with exchange rates?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes. The number that we gave you was based on current exchange rate, Bryan. So if anything happens to the exchange rate going forward, it would obviously impact that outlook.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess when you look at, I think, some of the reaction today to the pro forma, I suspect that there is some -- still some lingering question about kind of the ongoing margins and whether or not they're sustainable. And I think part of it is foreign exchange has had a pretty significant negative effect on the translated number, so I think that's one thing. The second is, and I'd like to get your insight into this, just how much -- is there any purchase accounting or any other accounting adjustments that have been made that would be negatively affecting it? And then finally, just in terms of kind of where we stand today on margins, just what -- why you think that this is a good base and a base to grow off of?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Maybe I'll take the purchase accounting question quickly, Bryan. The purchase accounting had a very minimal impact on our EBITDA and our EBITDA pretax numbers. In fact, the numbers that were announced at the time of the deal, the numbers that were showing down the pro forma are very similar. There's very little difference between the two.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, and Bryan, as I sort of highlighted in the script, we've had a chance to look at this business. We can see the structure of the business both in terms of the top line, in terms of the pricing and the margins that are being driven out there plus the cost structure and any likely increased costs that we might have in terms of running the business plus the capital structure that we think we're going to need going forward. And really, as I said in the script, we are very confident of the EBITDA margins. Our local currency are sustainable. We also believe that the initial chore that we made on the business in terms of what we thought we'd have to spend in capital was over ragged and so we -- our capital expenditure going forward is less than we expected. And we also expect to drive up the synergies. So we're very confident on all of those 3 points. And on a much broader basis, I have to say we're very pleased with the business that we bought and we're very confident that we'll hit the sort of return rates that we talked about at the very early part of the 3 to 5 years that we've always outlined.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then if I could follow up. It sounds like February had a pretty negative effect on the first quarter. And can you just talk about how volatile or how this business is affected by weather. Is it any more weather-sensitive, I guess, relative to your core businesses or was the weather just so extreme that it had that type of effect?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, the weather was so extreme. The business closed down and even with the rain in the U.K., we never got to that level, so that's -- it's was just a -- I wouldn't say it's a one-off but it was very extreme weather.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one final question. There was a -- in the quarter, you had some write-downs in China. Can you just talk a little bit more about what drove that and if there's anything that we'd anticipate going forward in that regard?", "Krishnan Anand", "Well, this is Kandy, Bryan. In our International business, as you know, it's been growing strong top line, putting 30% in the quarter, specifically the China. Our performance has been below expectations since the inception of the JV, led with the challenges by joint venture partner. As a result, they did the testing and wrote off the entire goodwill related to the joint venture in this quarter. We have an agreement to buy out the minority interest of our joint venture partner this quarter. However, due to developments, we think closing of that agreement is challenged, and therefore, we are, at this point of time, looking at other alternatives for that investment.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So you're needing a different partner there?", "Krishnan Anand", "We're looking at all the alternatives at this time, Bryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Watson from HSBC.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "First question, just wanted to go on StarBev, the kind of marketing that you were pulling forward. I was just curious why -- what you were so confident in, in the first half having kind of just been able to take over this business that you wanted to -- that you wanted to pull forward if there were certain great opportunities that you saw or certain things that you felt were just so obvious, certain brands or things that you wanted to pull that forward as opposed to kind of waiting to own the business a little longer before phasing in the marketing that way?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "James, we probably need make this a bit clearer. We didn't make those decisions. Those decisions were made by the previous management. So we deflected -- and they're reflected in the pro forma results. As I already point out, we only had the business for a couple of weeks. So we did not make those decisions. They were made previously.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "And then I'll just go further. In terms of your marketing, do you see any big opportunities when you look at certain brands, certain regions that perhaps having done more due diligence in the last -- since our last conversation that you'd like to talk about?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Well, yes. I think that the -- as we said, we've got very strong positions in most of the markets. The team has done a very good job on innovation in terms of line extensions, making new flavors. And a lot of investment that went on in the first half was behind that innovation. And as Mark said, that's really, excuse the term, that's bearing fruit now. The other part of it would be that Staropramen was extended into most of the markets last year and early this year. Investments gone behind that brand and that brand's performing exceptionally well. That's a mixed play because it indexes at around 110, 115 compared to most of our core brands, so that's growing at strong double digits so we're pleased about that. And looking forward, we're currently examining the year and researching the possibility of expanding the Carling brand into some of the markets, but we haven't yet matched the product nor do we have the consumer research back yet. But they would be the 3 main areas I'd highlight.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "Okay. And Staropramen at 110 or 115, I was just wondering how big of a premium segment do a lot of these markets have built out and if you were to bring Carling in, would that be kind of squarely within an International premium segment?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes. The premium or the above premium, whichever sector we're talking about, they're both mainstream category in all of these markets is pretty limited and so that's an opportunity going forward. And as we -- as GDP grows in these markets, we would expect that sector to -- or that category, sorry, to increase as a percentage of the overall business. Carling will be -- again, we haven't done a consumer research so we can't tell you what exactly what the index would be, but it would certainly be above the average.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just quickly on Canada. Looking at your main competitor there, they also seem to lose share in the second quarter. So I was just wondering where the competitive pressure is. Is this coming from in -- Canada? And if it's coming from smaller brewers or from retailers pushing pricing. How long that can last if that's going to spill over to the mainstream from the value brands?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Again, I'll let Dave go into detail, but you've got it right. It has to do with smaller brewers in the value sector that they're the ones who are picking up the share in general. But Dave, do you have any more specifics?", "David Dunnewald", "No. I mean it's a long-standing trend where we've seen the smaller national and regional brewers playing hard in the value segment and picking up share there. It's the reason that we've done things like the introduction of Keystone a couple of years ago and working hard on our position with it in the value segment. It's a very, very fragmented segment. The competitive set is different in each region and so it takes some finesse to compete in that segment and the work that we have going on, but it is an ongoing trend that we face.", "James C. Watson - HSBC, Research Division", "Did the pricing pressure from -- within value spill over to mainstream and all? Is the gap between value and mainstream kind of staying where you want it to stay?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, the gap is larger in the West, frankly, than where I'd like to see it. I mean, you have some provinces where value index is as low as a 53, but generally, in the major markets across the country, the gap is manageable. But you will get the exception in a couple of the Western markets where the gaps are large enough that it certainly spills into the mainstream.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Again, Mark, I wanted to try to understand a little bit better what's going on with the mix in StarBev and how you think about the stickiness of volume as you move into next year. On the mix side, you're getting -- you're netting out a positive net sales per hectoliter. Are these incremental products you're putting more emphasis on? Are they gross margin-enhancing? Are they gross margin-degrading? And then, how do you think about the stickiness of this volume lift? What -- I really don't understand what's driving it in terms of products or channels. You're spending -- or the prior management decided to up spending in the second quarter, but I'm not sure where that money is going against and whether it's sustained volume lift.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay, I mean, there's a number of question in there, Mark, so let me try and kind of pick my way through them. The orientation of the business is really from a portfolio perspective to drive everything we can at core, which is our mainstream brands or above and everything we're doing from an innovation perspective should be margin enhancing versus our average margins, so that really is the focus of the commercial team. And the bulk of incremental investment in sales and marketing in the first half or really the second quarter has gone principally behind innovation agenda and our core brands, so you've got to remember we currently got the #1 brand in 4 markets and we're strong #2 or #3 in the other markets. So investing in our core brand, not dissimilar to Coors Light investment in the U.S. or Canadian Coors Light investment in Canada or Carling in the U.K., that remains absolutely central to our thinking. So we're looking to continue to strengthen the backbone of our business through marketing and orientate the business to top line and value growth on the back of the premiumizing the portfolio with a big chunk of that being driven by our innovation agenda. The mix that we refer to is a combination of things that's a shift in some of the dynamic in our customer mix, but we're seeing some shift from our traditional trade to what's called key accounts here or you'd recognize as the grocery channel. And a little bit of mix on packaging types as well as we move from some returnable bottles into more nonreturnable packaging, things like PET in some of the markets. So below the top line, there's a combination of different factors going on and our job is obviously to manage that holistically and make sure that the total number moves in the right direction and that's what the team generally have been doing and continue to do.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And so it sounds like the objective is mix enhancement. But because of the channel mix and because of the package mix, there's been a little bit of a mix degrade, is that a fair assumption? And how do you think about lapping these volumes benefits? I know it's very early days, but how do you think about that?", "Mark Hunter", "Well, I'd probably characterize the challenge much more as more general top line growth. So a combination of both pricing, volume and mix all being managed effectively. And the good news is that if you look at overall industry trends, the likelihood of a stronger industry growth than we've seen in other markets is higher because of the economic growth that we have seen here from a GDP perspective. And even against the broader eurozone, we expect GDP growth to be at least twice that we'll see across the broader eurozone and correlation between GDP growth and industry beer volume growth is very strong. So I have relatively high degree of confidence as long as the economic situation doesn't take a dramatic turn for the worst, that the volume growth should come through in the business and if we can continue to manage pricing and mix, as the team have been doing, and drive innovation agenda, maintaining and developing the margins and our local currency level should be well within our capabilities.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer's Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "A couple of questions. It would be helpful if we could get the 8% increase in SG&A in the Central and Eastern European business, how much of that was a pull forward, I guess, versus just sort of underlying growth in the quarter? And then the second one would be in Canada, how much did the shift of Canada Day impact volumes?", "David Dunnewald", "Do you want me to take Canada first, probably simpler? Our estimate for the quarter is that it was about 2%, a 2% impact on volume.", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, can you just repeat the 8% referring to?", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "So I think you said in local currency, MG&A was up 8% in Central and Eastern Europe. We've obviously talked a lot about that being pulled forward or I guess marketing expenses being pulled forward for the second half. I just was trying to understand what the, if you will, the underlying or x that pull forward increase was just so that we can understand what the underlying growth in MG&A would have been or might be as we think about this going forward?", "Mark Hunter", "Well, let me talk specifically about sales and marketing. So on a full year basis, we would expect our sales and marketing to be relatively flat year-on-year, so that's probably the best indication I can give you of the difference in phasing that's taken place in our investment. So on a total year basis, we're currently projecting sales and marketing investment to be generally flat. So you'll need to work back from there how much of that flowed through as incremental in the first half. I don't have that specific number in front of me.", "David Dunnewald", "Brett, to be sure, that's in local currency that Mark is talking about.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Yes.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Thank you, Martina, and thank you, everybody, for taking part this morning or this afternoon. We really welcome the interest, and look forward to speaking to you at the next quarter's announcement. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thank you, Chrissy. Hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call, and thank you for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Dave Perkins, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Central Europe; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors U.K.; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors' Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.", "On the earnings call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our third quarter results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter.", "The third quarter was our first full reporting period following our Central European acquisition. The addition of this business provided more than $60 million of pretax earnings accretion on an underlying basis, net of related interest expense. Strong results in the U.S. also contributed to our bottom line growth. As a result, underlying after-tax income increased more than 17% to $249 million, and underlying EPS grew more than 20% to $1.37 per share. Gross margin and underlying operating margin, including our share of MillerCoors, both increased significantly with the addition of the Central Europe business this year.", "Regionally, the U.S. had another good earnings quarter, up 16%, while the U.K., Canada and our International business reported lower earnings, with the Canada beer market being particularly weak in the third quarter. In local currency, Central Europe underlying earnings increased nearly 16% on a pro forma basis. Negative currency movements, however, meant Central Europe pro forma earnings decreased 2.2% in the third quarter. Central Europe pro forma volume declined 1.5% due to a decrease in consumer demand, particularly in September, but we maintained solid market share in the region. Gavin will provide additional financial highlights in a minute.", "With respect to our brands, third quarter Coors Light brand sales to retail grew market share in the U.S., the U.K. and in Canada. In Central Europe, we grew share in the majority of our markets, and Staropramen brand grew volume at a low double-digit rate in the region. Our premium craft brands in the U.S. and Canada substantially outperformed the industry to grow market share in the quarter. Miller Lite declined mid-single digits but reduced its trend graph to the overall market versus the first half of the year. The Carling brand grew share in its biggest channel, the on-premise, in a very weak U.K. economy, whilst Coors Light is growing at a strong double-digit rate and is now our second biggest brand in the U.K.", "Nonetheless, we saw a decline in consumer demand across our businesses in the third quarter, and we expect the fourth quarter to be the most challenging of this year, with difficult profit comparisons in Canada and the U.K. and higher costs in the U.S. and Central Europe.", "In this challenging macroeconomic climate, we have consistently said that in addition to growing our brands, we would aggressively drive costs out of our business. In the third quarter, our Resources for Growth program delivered $22 million in saving, bringing total program savings to $172 million since 2010. In Canada and the U.K., these cost savings offset cost of goods inflation. Our share of MillerCoors results added another $12 million of cost saving.", "Consistent with this strategy, in the third quarter, we began a number of new initiatives to standardize and further streamline our company over the next 2 years. As a first step, at the end of this year, we will combine our U.K. and Ireland business with our new Central Europe organization to create a single European business called Molson Coors Europe.  This move will allow us to use our go-to-market resources more effectively in the region and promote better sharing of commercial best practices and marketing expertise. With the larger European footprint, we'll be able to negotiate better terms with suppliers, improve processes and integrate systems to increase efficiencies. We will continue to manage the export and license business in Europe, including Staropramen export through Molson Coors International.", "Along with this restructuring, we are making a few leadership changes. First, I've named Mark Hunter as CEO of our combined Europe business effective January 1. Since taking on the leadership of Molson Coors Central Europe earlier this year, Mark has gained deep insight into the business and earned the trust and confidence of the new team. And it's a major advantage for us that Mark brings so much experience with these markets to his new expanded role.", "Next, Dave Perkins plans to retire at the end of January. Dave has spent more than 30 years in the beer business and has led operations around the globe, from Asia to Europe to Mexico and beyond. It is fitting that he retires from the top job in Canada after spending so many years successfully building the Molson brands.", "Finally, I have appointed Stewart Glendinning to replace David as CEO in Canada upon Dave's retirement. Stewart's experience includes a broad range of executive leadership positions, including Global Chief Financial Officer and CEO U.K. and Ireland. And as such, he is perfectly qualified to lead the Canada business.", "With that as an overview, I'll turn it over to Gavin to give third quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the fourth quarter. Gavin?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks, Peter, and hello, everybody. In third quarter financial highlights, Molson Coors third quarter underlying earnings increased 17.2% to $248 million -- $248.9 million, while underlying earnings per share increased 20.2% to $1.37 per share. The acquisition of Central Europe drove the increase in underlying EPS, along with the performance of MillerCoors and lower shares outstanding, following our repurchases in the second half of last year. Earnings accretion from Central Europe is made up of $82.6 million of underlying pretax income in the quarter, including the export business that is now part of our International group and partially offset by $22.4 million of acquisition-related interest expense in Corporate.", "Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased nearly 31% due to the addition of Central Europe results. On a pro forma basis, including Central Europe in 2011, worldwide volume decreased 3% for the quarter, driven by lower volume in the U.K., the United States, Canada and Central Europe and partially offset by growth in International.", "Regionally, MillerCoors contributed a 16% increase in underlying profit, driven by continued strong pricing, favorable brand mix and cost reductions. In Canada, positive pricing and cost reductions were more than offset by the negative impact of lower volume and mix shift towards higher-cost products and packages, increased pension costs and foreign currency movements. The U.K. had a very challenging quarter due to lower volumes, higher input inflation, cycling the prior year reduction in employee incentive expenses, partially offset by cost reductions.", "Now a note about how we are presenting our results for our new Central Europe business and MillerCoors International. In order to provide the most useful information, we will discuss Central Europe results this year in comparison to pro forma results for the comparable prior year period. As Peter mentioned, beginning this quarter, our International group is managing the export and license business for our Central Europe brands. The discussion of our consolidated financials and our Canada, U.K. and Corporate results will be on the same basis as before the Central Europe acquisition.", "As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business. On this basis, total company net sales increased 14.2% in the third quarter, driven by the addition of the Central Europe business, along with growth in the U.S. and International. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 11.8% in the quarter due to the addition of Central Europe sales with a lower net sales per hectoliter, which more than offset solid pricing in the U.S., Central Europe and Canada. Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 13.2% due to the addition of Central Europe, which has a lower cost structure than our other segments. Total company gross margin was 41.4%, 100 basis points higher than a year ago, primarily due to the strong economies of scale and margin structure in Central Europe, coupled with the margin expansion of 140 basis points in the U.S. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 12% due to the addition of Central Europe results. Underlying operating margin was 17.3%, up 150 basis points from a year ago due to the addition of Central Europe operating income this year and margin growth in the U.S.", "Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter, including for Central Europe, on a comparable pro forma basis.", "It is important to note that our third quarter underlying results exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to a $62.4 million pretax charge. These adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to Central Europe acquisition, financing and integration and the impairment of our China joint venture, and are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "Underlying free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of this year totaled $742 million, nearly reaching our goal of $750 million, plus or minus 10%, for 2012. This $278 million increase over last year was primarily driven by an increase in operating cash flow due to the addition of Central Europe and year-over-year changes in the timing of working capital. Our year-to-date cash generation was made up of the following: $840 million of operating cash flow, which includes $437 million from MillerCoors, plus $148 million of net addbacks for Central Europe acquisition-related costs, along with purchases and sales of businesses and other assets. Investing cash outflows were $143 million of capital spending and $103 million of cash invested in MillerCoors. Although we nearly achieved our full year free cash flow goal in the third quarter, it is important to remember that timing of working capital can have a large effect on quarterly cash generation. And our goal of $750 million, plus or minus 10%, is unchanged.", "Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $4.7 billion, $200 million lower than the beginning of the quarter. And cash and cash equivalents totaled $586 million, resulting in net debt of $4.1 billion, approximately $300 million lower than 3 months earlier.", "Looking forward, we are updating our guidance in a few areas. We expect our 2012 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $135 million, with about $40 million of this representing acquisition-related fees and expenses that we exclude from our underlying results. After lowering our 2012 effective tax rate guidance in September to a range of 15% to 19%, we are now also lowering our long-term tax rate guidance to a range of 20% to 24%. This 2-percentage-point reduction in the range is principally due to the Central Europe acquisition.", "As far as our cost outlook is concerned, in Canada for 2012, we continue to expect our all-in cost of goods sold to increase at a high single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency due to higher pension costs, mix shifts towards higher-cost brands and packages and the absence of the NAB contract volume in the first half of last year. In the United States, we continue to expect MillerCoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2012. In Central Europe, we now anticipate a mid-single-digit increase in pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency, a change driven by increases in both brewing and packaging material costs. In the U.K., we still expect our full year cost of goods sold per hectoliter to grow at a high single-digit rate in local currency, primarily due to input inflation, sales mix, pension costs and expenses related to the U.K. brewery improvement program. Our International business anticipate cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease at a low single-digit rate for the full year due to the addition of the Central Europe export business, along with geographic mix changes.", "In other outlook, at current rates, we do not expect foreign exchange to have a significant impact on consolidated fourth quarter financial results. Nonetheless, as Peter mentioned, we expect the fourth quarter to be the most challenging overall this year, with difficult profit and volume comparisons in Canada and the U.K., along with increased input costs in Central Europe and significantly higher marketing and business transformation costs in the United States.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. In Canada, we launched Rickard's Cardigan and Oakhouse, our first seasonal brands in the Rickard's family. We continue to realize strong pricing gains but remain focused on managing the right balance of price and volume. Our recent fourth quarter volume trends reflect continued industry weakness, as well as the impact of the National Hockey League lockout, which has limited our opportunity to activate Molson Canadian and Coors Light at retail.", "Also, in the fourth quarter, we are cycling the 53rd week in our fiscal 2011, which last year provided approximately $12 million of additional pretax income in Canada. We are also cycling approximately $10 million of adjustments last year that we do not expect to repeat this year. And finally, we anticipate about $5 million of additional pension and other retirement expenses in the fourth quarter, which is consistent with each of the first 3 quarters this year.", "In the U.S., we expect fourth quarter results to be affected significantly by incremental spending for marketing and business transformation, as well as the impact of a planned reduction in distributor inventories by year end. Specifically, we expect to see high single-digit increase in MillerCoors' marketing, general and administrative costs, driven by brand investments in the range of $20 million higher than last year, along with a substantial increase in business transformation spending, which is designed to transform the way the U.S. team works to improving core capabilities, simplifying business processes and building information systems. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. sales to wholesalers have significantly outpaced sales to retailers, resulting in higher distributor inventory levels at the end of September versus prior year. However, given MillerCoors' plan to shift to consumption for the full year, we expect distributor inventory levels to revert to 2011 levels by year's end.", "In Central Europe, our third quarter results were impacted by weak economic conditions. However, we grew share in the majority of our markets in the region. Our innovations continued to take share and support margin growth. We plan to accelerate further introductions to additional countries in the near term. Because the business put forward its investments behind innovations and marketing efforts ahead of the peak season this year, our results in the third quarter benefited from lower marketing and innovation spending versus a year ago. We expect this benefit to continue in the fourth quarter. Additionally, following expansion last year, Staropramen is growing strongly across all of the Central Europe markets in which we operate.", "In the U.K., we are capitalizing on the success of Carling Zest citrus by introducing a winter version with a hint of spiced orange. Also, our brewery network investment continues, with building work started in preparation for the arrival of a new state-of-the-art bottling line in Burton in the first quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter, we face particularly challenging STR and underlying profit comparisons, which increased 16% and 29%, respectively, in the U.K. a year ago.", "Our International business continues to drive top line growth through our key global brands. And the addition to Staropramen to our portfolio enhances our growth opportunities. We now expect the 2012 investment in our International business to be moderately lower than last year on an underlying basis, including the benefit of 6 months of Central Europe export earnings.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail in the first 4 weeks of the quarter declined at a high single-digit rate versus 2011, primarily related to continued industry declines, along with the NHL lockout. In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended October 27, STRs were flat versus a year ago. In Central Europe, our sales volume decreased at a low single-digit rate in the first month of the quarter. In the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our U.K. STRs decreased at a low double-digit rate, driven by challenging comparisons in the off-premise channel. And in the first 4 weeks, our International STRs decreased at a double-digit rate, excluding the addition of Central Europe export, driven by the year-on-year timing differences and the deconsolidation of the China joint venture. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "To summarize our discussion today, in the first full quarter of owning our Central Europe business, the addition of these results, net of financing costs, drove strong earnings growth. We continue to expect that the acquisition will strengthen our company, enhance our growth profile and increase shareholder value. In the third quarter, we grew total company underlying free cash flow, operating profit, after-tax income and earnings per share, all at double-digit rates. Looking forward, we anticipate significant volume and earnings headwinds in the fourth quarter. Recognizing these challenges in our businesses, we began a number of new initiatives in the third quarter to standardize and further streamline our company over the next 2 years. Combining the U.K. and Ireland business with our new Central Europe organization to create a single Molson Coors Europe business is the start of that process. All of these steps are designed to improve efficiency and effectiveness across our company and drive profit cash and value for our shareholders.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. That call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "So at this point, Chrissy, we would like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The first question is just really trying to understand better what's going on in Canada, both from an industry perspective and from your market share perspective, so just some color around the industry-wide softness that you're seeing. And then your volume softness, how much is that industry-wide-driven as opposed to maybe competitive environment getting worse, especially for some of the value brands?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, okay, Judy, thanks. I'll pass that on to Dave. There are a number of moving parts, and so I think it's better if Dave gives you the detail on that. Dave?", "David Perkins", "... and in Molson volume for quarter 3. Nonetheless, we did see underlying softness in the industry. Hand in hand with that, we saw a pretty competitive pricing environment, so more beer being sold on promotion across the country. And the other thing that we saw that was very significant for us was a strong shift to cans that has been unfolding through the year. And just to give you a sense of the significance, in a market like Qu\u00e9bec, where it was most pronounced, we saw cans increase about 30%, so very significant shift. Within that context, we maintained positive pricing. I think you've seen in our NSR per hec numbers that we've led the industry there. So I'm pleased on the pricing front. We lost about 1 share point. We estimate 1/2 of that share loss is related to can shortages that we ran through the quarter. And so we had difficulty meeting that unexpectedly large shift to cans. We're at very high capacity utilization, our first season of ramping up our major new can line in Montreal. And so we did run some reasonably extensive shortages of product. So that would account for about 1/2 the share loss, as I said. The remainder of the share loss is really what I've talked about in prior quarters, you've seen it in recent quarters, and it's the segment shifting that we continue to experience. So we're very well developed in the mainstream. We are less well developed in above-premium, but we're growing our share there, and that's really a focus for us. And then we're quite underdeveloped in value where we see growth. And through Keystone and the use of regional brands, we continue to attempt to strengthen our position there. And so the segment shifting is really the key factor in the underlying longer-term trend that you're seeing, and in this quarter, as I say, amplified by a can shortage. Just to give you a sense on the regional front, we did moderate our share decline in the West. We were more price competitive in the quarter. And we saw a response to that, that gives us confidence as we continue to play with the price and volume balance, that we do have responsiveness in our portfolio. Unfortunately, the gains we made in the West were more than offset by lost sales in the East with the can shortage.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And Dave, is it...", "David Perkins", "Is that helpful?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's helpful. But the can shortage situation, is that pretty much done, and now you're back into meeting demands on the can side?", "David Perkins", "Yes, that is behind us. And as we look to next year, with the can line in year 2 and with advanced planning, we're confident in our ability to meet what seems to be a pretty strong trend in the market. As far as October is concerned, just to give you a sense there in what we're seeing, I mean, there's probably 2 key factors. We are cycling the strongest quarter from an industry perspective that we saw last year. So the industry, even taking out the 53rd-week effect, was up 1.8%. So it was a strong result, and that was behind very good weather that we're not benefiting from this year. And the NHL lockout is a major -- NHL is a major property for us. Hockey generates a lot of beer occasions in Canada, whether it's in bars, in home or in the venues. And it's a really important part of how we activate behind our power brands, Coors Light and Canadian. So we're obviously working to replace the hockey programming, but hockey would be the premier property. And on top, we lose the direct volume in the hockey venues that are ours.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just secondly, in Central Europe, just again, sort of the demand falloff that you saw in September because you talked about July being up high-single digits, so clearly, the quarter -- the late quarter trends were much weaker than we saw in the -- earlier in the quarter. So can you just give us some sense of what's happening both from a macro perspective as just well as from a competitive perspective? And then sort of in terms of what's happening with the macro being tougher in those markets, how are you thinking about the ability to maybe even extract more cost savings, particularly as you integrate the U.K. business into Central Europe and have a wholly integrated European division?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "So, Judy, I'll take the second part of that question first, and I'll let Mark address the first part. For the moment, we've put $50 million as a synergy number for Central Europe, and that's the number we're speaking to. As I alluded to in the script, we're starting with the reorganization in Central Europe and the U.K. But obviously, we need to make more cost moves within the business, and that will be something that we can talk about at a later date. So, Mark, you want to talk specifically about consumer demand and market share in Central Europe?", "Mark Hunter", "Sure. Judy, just to your very specifics, to start at macro level, I think what we saw as we went through the third quarter, really through the second half of August then in September, real kind of slowdown in consumer demand. Now clearly, we're currently investigating what we think is driving that. Probably at the highest level, what we are seeing is the GDP forecasts for, first of all, with the markets that we operate in turning in a negative direction versus the 2011 numbers. And certainly, in Serbia, Croatia, Hungary and Czech, we expect GDP to be actually negative by the end of 2012 on a full year basis. So there's clearly a macro sluggishness from a demand perspective, and that manifested itself in industry volumes. And I'll just pick a couple of markets to give you an example. So at the end of August, the Hungarian market was up about 2.5 points in volume; in September, it was down 5 points. Czech market was up just under a couple of points the end of August; and in September, it was down 7.5 points. So clearly, in September, consumers tightened their belt. Now clearly, to your second question, what does that mean competitively, well, those pressures are felt by us and all of our competitors. The good news is that in 5 of our 7 markets, we actually grew share, and in our biggest markets, we continued to grow our business, which was good news, and grow our pricing. And obviously, that manifested itself in a double-digit increase in our earnings, which is very, very positive. I think the one thing just to call out and flag to you is probably the Romanian market. So if you look at industry volume in Central Europe through the third quarter, our handling level looks reasonably -- volume is up about 4%. So 90% of that growth came in Romania. And it came in Romania in a very, very low margin segment, the value segment. And I think one of our competitors had already flagged the fact that they saw very, very high growth, but it had actually been margin dilutive on a Pan-European basis. We choose not to compete there, so we actually gave up some share in Romania as one of the 2 markets where we gave up some share. If you strip out Romania, industry was up by less than 1%. If you strip out Romania in our business, our volume was actually up by about 3%. So excluding the Romanian market, where there is that volatility in the value segment, I feel very, very pleased with our performance, as I say, strong earnings growth and share growth in 5 of the 7 markets. And we continue to manage our costs very effectively, both from an investment perspective and a G&A perspective. So I think the business is feeling very solid and competitively performing very strongly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So, Peter, given some of the volume struggles around the world really across your geographies, as well as market share issues and the difficult macro environment you cited, do you think you need to boost marketing spending going forward to drive a volume pickup in 2013? And also, how do you protect profit in that difficult environment? I'd love some clarity just on kind of prioritizing volume growth versus profit in your key markets at this point given the environment.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Sure. Thanks very much. Well, as we flagged in the earnings, we're actually increasing our G&A marketing spend in the U.S. by a figure of around about $20 million. So the short answer is yes, we're taking some action. We did increase our marketing spend this year, which we flagged at the beginning of the year. In terms of how we're addressing it, I think Dave alluded to the fact -- and I think Tom did in the U.S. earnings call this morning, that most of our portfolios are skewed towards mainstream premium. And we suffer from not having enough exposure to above-premium. And what you'll see is both from -- in all of our innovation activity that we've undertaken over the last couple of years and going forward, we're very much skewed towards premiumizing the portfolio. And so we're looking to mix as being a big driver for us over a 2- to 3-year period. So if you look at some -- again, U.S. was talked about this morning, but if you looked at what we did in the U.K. this year with Carling Zest, that was very much a premium play. The Coors Light Iced T was a premium play. Aluminum Pints, it's selling at an index of 1 10 to 1 20 was a premium play, and so on. And so really, that's the way that we're dealing with it.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And when do you think you'll give us more clarity on the potential level of cost savings from the combination of the U.K. and Ireland business with Central Europe? And also, just can you give us a sense of the overall cost-cutting potential or productivity potential at your company as we look going forward versus recent trend, and if at some point you'll outline new longer-term cost savings goals across the company?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, we'll be in a position to give you much more detail, I would suspect, when we have our analyst call next year in New York, and so we can be much more definitive then. In terms of the overall approach, I mean, we've consistently said that we see cost saving as something that's an ongoing task within the business. We believe there is more cost to take out of the business, and we're actively seeking to do that at the moment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Gavin, on the cost of sales per hectoliter, I wonder if you could speak directionally as you look beyond the fourth quarter, whether it's fair to characterize the whole of Molson Coors as being in a less inflationary environment next year than you've been this year, and perhaps even remark whether a given region -- how a given region might compare to that overall performance.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Mark, sorry, I can't help you at this point in time. What we normally do is we give our cost of goods sold guidance for the year during our fourth quarter earnings call. So we'll be doing that for you in February of next year.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then probably a little bit more, Gavin or Peter or Mark, on the consolidation of Europe. Can you walk us through a little bit about how you're thinking has unfolded since you announced the StarBev transaction, how much the performance in September and October has motivated this decision to consolidate, and how much of this was other factors and part of the game plan when you announced the transaction?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Sure, Mark, I'll take that. Short answer, no, it was not motivated or driven by anything that happened in September or October. We always planned to look at this and probably do it. It's pretty standard for most businesses to have a European platform, which -- the honest truth is we expected integration to be slower and take longer than we expected. We are -- really, this is a good news story because the integration has gone much more smoothly and has bedded in much more quickly than we expected. So we just feel we're in a position to be able to make this call earlier than we would've otherwise done, simple as that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I've got 2 questions. One, just in Central Europe on the cost of goods per hectoliter or the input costs, is there anything different about that market that would cause -- I guess, what I'm trying to drive at is whether or not you're -- there is some difference in the way that you buy raw materials there, you're not hedged out as far -- where it would've -- where you would've seen an increase relative to what you were thinking back in July? Or was it just simply the type of raw materials or the type of costs that increased are the type that you can't hedge? Just try to make me understand whether there's something different about that market in terms of the way you buy raw materials than your other markets.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Sure, I understand. Bryan, I think the best thing is I'll let Mark talk to the specific of what's driven the difference between our Q2 guidance and Q3 guidance. It's very simple and straightforward. I'll let Mark do that, and then maybe Gavin might want to come back in terms of hedging and what have you. So, Mark?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes. So in headline terms, I wouldn't point to anything that's materially different between how we buy in Central Europe versus other parts of our market. Relative to the guidance we gave in Q2, the only thing that is different has been really the issue with grain harvests across Europe cost, particularly in Romania and Serbia. And that's having an impact on costs as we move into Q4. Everything else is very much in line with the guidance that we offered.", "Gavin Hattersley", "And from a hedging point of view, Bryan, as you know, we've got a very comprehensive hedging program in the U.S., and we've got a solid and comprehensive growth hedging program in our other businesses. And our supply chain group is working to get Central Europe embedded in those programs. So I would say they're not quite at the same level from a hedging perspective as the rest of our businesses are, and we're getting there quite quickly.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Peter, just as a follow-up to Dara's question earlier, I'd just go back to the Investor Day in March. I mean, the message that we took away -- one of the messages we took away was that they're trying to rebalance -- you're trying to rebalance the model so that we get to a point where we're seeing more of the profit growth driven by sales growth as opposed to being overly dependent on cost saves and that's sort of the motivation to increase the new product innovation, part of the motivation to get into the StarBev markets. And clearly, right now, we're not seeing the top line growth for a number of reasons. But just, I guess, as I listen to a new or some incremental cost savings potentially over the next 2 years, I just want to make sure that we're -- I'm clear that what's happening isn't that we're sort of losing faith in the ability to drive the top line and thus are going to focus more on cost savings, or as much as this is just something that you weren't ready to talk about in March, and it's still an imperative to drive the top line to sustainably drive the bottom line. I hope that's clear.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "No, it's very clear, Bryan, and it's a great point, and you've got it spot on. We -- in no way are we abandoning the top line. I mean, the business really has to show top line growth. It's a journey, though, so as I said earlier, a lot of what we're trying to do is to get the above-premium part of our overall portfolio moving in the right direction. We have undoubtedly suffered from a lack of consumer demand in a number of our markets in this quarter. But the cost-saving piece is just the other part of the triangle. We've consistently said that we will continue to look at cost savings and continue to drive down costs in the business. So really, it's not an either/or, it's very much doing both of them.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "A quick question on Canada. With pricing for you guys up 3, I think your competitor was up 1.25, volumes were down, I guess if we back out Canada, we're down 3% in the quarter. So I mean, how sustainable is, I guess, the better pricing that we're seeing from others in the market, and how should we think about that going forward? And then a second question is on Coors Light Iced T. Obviously, you guys made a big deal about that. At the Analyst Day, can you just give us an update, I don't know, if it's -- what it's contributing to your business in terms of growth or consumer demand on that side?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Brett.", "David Perkins", "Yes, sure. On the pricing front, we have outpaced the competition, there's no question. It wouldn't have made sense to do anything differently given the shortages we were running. Our net pricing would have been about 2%, and then the balance was through mix. So we do have a meaningful premiumization effect in our business, and I think that is sustainable. Coors Light is a really good example of that. I mean, Coors Light has come out the end of the summer in line with our expectations. It was profitable in year 1 for us despite a fairly aggressive investment behind it. And it appears to have had a halo effect on the mother brand because Coors Light itself has performed better than it has in recent years even. So we're quite happy with what we've seen overall there. And I think it is indicative of what we're able to do through premiumization. Look, how that plays out in terms of the price volume mix and the competitive dynamic, we watch that from day to day, but what's happened in this quarter was the right thing to have happen. Does that answer both your questions adequately?", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "It does. If I could just have one follow-up, so without the NHL -- I'm just trying to think about how we model this in the fourth quarter -- there's certainly going -- clearly going to be a volume impact on it. Is there less marketing dollars going in because of, I guess, the loss of the ability to activate against NHL?", "David Perkins", "Well, I wouldn't give guidance on what we're doing in Q4 on marketing spend. What I'd say is we are looking for and are working behind substitute programming to ensure that we remain competitive in the quarter. But as I said earlier, there is no doubt that this property is quite unique in its impact both on industry volume and on our share. And so to think that we can actually replace it in the short term, I think, is unrealistic.", "Operator", "Your next question -- sorry, since that person got out of queue, there are no further questions in queue at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thank you, Chrissy. Thank you for everybody for joining us today and for your interest in the business, and we look forward to speaking to you again at the fourth quarter earnings call.

Underlying after-tax income declined 28%, driven by a higher tax rate and cycling strong quarterly results the year before, which included an additional week in our fiscal 2011 and some other onetime factors that did not repeat in 2012. Gavin will provide additional details on the fourth quarter performance in a few minutes.", "For the full year 2012, the biggest news was the acquisition of our Central Europe business, which we expect to strengthen our company, enhance our growth profile and increase shareholder value in the years ahead. We have begun implementing plans to capture synergies, leverage best practices and pay down debt related to buying this new business.", "This acquisition helped our 2012 worldwide volume grow by 14%, net sales by more than 11% and underlying earnings per share by 4%. In addition, Molson Coors generated $865 million of underlying free cash flow, up nearly 40% from 2011.", "In 2012, we continued to focus on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy, namely: to grow profitably in our core businesses through brands and innovation; to grow in new and emerging markets; and, when it meets our strict shareholder return criteria, to grow through M&A. As in previous years, the first of these pillars was our primary focus as we continued to invest in key brands and fill our innovation pipeline.", "In 2012, Coors Light grew market share in the U.S., U.K. and including Ice T, in Canada. And our premium craft portfolios in the U.S. and Canada outperformed the industry and grew market share.", "In Canada, during 2012, we achieved positive price and brand mix. We strengthened our above-premium portfolio by introducing Rickard's Cardigan and Oakhouse seasonal brands and by acquiring the licenses for the Newcastle Brown Ale and Strongbow Cider brands. We also launched Aluminum Pint bottles for Coors Light and Molson Canadian.", "In the U.S., Coors Light significantly outperformed the premium light segment and posted its eighth consecutive year of growth. We completed the relaunch of Miller 64 and rolled out Leinenkugel's Lemon Berry Shandy and Batch 19. Also, in above-premium, we expanded Henry Weinhard's brands nationally and tested Redd's Apple Ale and Third Shift. The Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's brands continued to lead the craft beer segment with double-digit growth.", "We also purchased the Crispin Cider Company, which gives us brands in the fast-growing U.S. cider category. And we continue to work hard to improve volume trends for Miller Lite.", "In a very challenging U.K. beer market, we now have 2 of the fastest-growing premium brands in Coors Light and Doom Bar. We also introduced Carling Zest with the launch being recognized as the best of the year in the U.K. by ACNielsen.", "In Central Europe, we delivered a strong competitive performance in a tough trading environment with share and pricing growth in our key markets, accelerated innovation performance driven by beer mixes, Staropramen growth in double digits in 2012 and strict overhead cost management.", "On a full year basis, we took the market share leadership position in Bulgaria, we grew share in Croatia to its highest level for the past 10 years, and achieved strong volume growth and record on-premise share in the Czech Republic. We recorded solid share growth in all of our major markets in 2012 apart from Romania, where we gave up volume share in the thin-margin value segment.", "In our second growth pillar, our International business drove improved financial performance in the fourth quarter as it began liquidating its underperforming China joint venture, restructured its Coors Light business in the rest of China, improved performance in Japan and integrated the Central Europe license and export businesses.", "In M&A, the Central Europe integration has gone well. We are on schedule to capture the committed $50 million of cost and revenue synergies, and we are leveraging important processes and commercial learnings from this business globally. The addition of this business provided more than $17 million of pretax earnings accretion in 2012 on an underlying basis and net of related interest expenses.", "Beyond our growth pillars, we have consistently said that in addition to growing our brands, we would aggressively drive costs out of our business. In 2012, our Resources -- full Resources for Growth program delivered $74 million in savings, allowing us to close out this 3-year program with total savings of $200 million, which is $50 million higher than our original goal.", "Our share of MillerCoors results added another $46 million of cost savings.", "And in the area of corporate social responsibility, Molson Coors was selected as the 2012/2013 global beverage sector leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which is the most recognized global benchmark of sustainability among global corporations.", "With this as an overview of 2012, I'll turn it over to Gavin to get fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on 2013. Gavin?", "Christien Coors Ficeli", "Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors' fourth quarter underlying after-tax earnings decreased 28.4% to $126.1 million or $0.69 per share. The decline in results was driven by weak economic conditions and challenging prior year comparisons in all of our businesses.", "Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased more than 15% due to the addition of Central Europe results and strong Coors Light growth in all of our core markets. On a pro forma basis, including Central Europe in 2011, worldwide volume decreased 7% for the quarter, driven by lower volume in the U.K, Canada, Central Europe and international.", "Canada and U.K. declines were partially attributable to starting the 53rd week in our 2011 fiscal year.", "Regionally, lower volume translates into lower underlying profit performance.", "Results of this quarter were in line with expectations, and we continue to pursue additional sources of top line and bottom line growth, which we will discuss in a few minutes.", "Now a reminder about how we are presenting our results for our new Central Europe business and Molson Coors International. In order to provide the most useful information, we will discuss Central Europe results this year in comparison to pro forma results for the comparable prior year period. Also, our International group is managing the exports and license business for our Central Europe brands.", "As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business.", "On this basis, total company net sales increased 6.3% in the fourth quarter, driven by the addition of the Central Europe business along with growth in the United States. Net sales per hectoliter decreased 5.4% in the quarter due to the addition of Central Europe sales with lower net sales per hectoliter, which more than offset solid pricing in the U.S., Central Europe, Canada and internationally.", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 2.1% due to the addition of Central Europe, which has a lower cost structure than our other segments.", "Total company gross margin was 37.5%, 210 basis points lower than a year ago due to the impact of fixed-cost deleverage related to lower volume, higher input inflation, onetime margins that did not repeat and increased pension costs primarily in Canada and the U.K. These negative impacts were partially offset by margin expansion of 90 basis points in the U.S.", "Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 5.5% due to the addition of Central Europe results and increased investments in brands and business transformation by MillerCoors.", "Underlying operating margin was 11%, down 200 basis points from a year ago, driven by substantially the same factors as those affecting gross margins.", "Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "It is important to note that our fourth quarter underlying results exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to a $25.4 million pretax charge. Underlying results also exclude a $38.3 million noncash charge for the tax effect of a Serbian statutory corporate income tax rate increase.", "The pretax adjustments to our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to Central Europe, acquisitions, financing and restructuring charges in the U.K. and Canada, and they are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "Underlying free cash flow for 2012 totaled $865 million, which exceeded our previous estimate for the year of $750 million by $115 million largely due to improvements in year-over-year working capital management. This $246 million increase over the prior year was primarily driven by an increase in operating cash flow due to the addition of Central Europe and working capital improvements.", "Our 2012 cash generation was made up of the following factors: $984 million of operating cash flow, which includes $511 million from MillerCoors, plus $170 million of net addbacks to Central Europe acquisition-related costs, restructuring payments and MillerCoors' purchases of businesses and other assets. Investing cash outflows were $222 million in capital spending and $66 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.", "Total debt at the end of 2012 was $4.67 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $624 million, resulting in net debt of $4 billion, approximately $60 million lower than 3 months earlier.", "Looking forward to 2013, our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $700 million, plus or minus 10%. This goal is $165 million lower than our 2012 result because of 3 factors: higher capital spending and cash interest, primarily related to having our Central Europe business for the full year; higher cash taxes in 2013; and an increase of about $50 million in our total pension contributions. Currently, we anticipate approximately $150 million of cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013 and pension expense of about $50 million, both including 42% of MillerCoors.", "Our 2013 capital spending outlook is approximately $330 million, up from $222 million last year largely because we will have a full year Central Europe capital expenditure.", "We expect our 2013 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $105 million.", "Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2013 is approximately $170 million.", "We expect our 2013 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 20%, assuming no further changes in tax laws. Our 2012 underlying rate was 18%. We continue to see our long-term tax rate to be in a range of 20% to 24%, but we anticipate that it will take a few years to move to that range.", "As far as our cost outlook is concerned, in Canada for 2013, we expect our cost of goods sold to increase at a mid-single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency. In the United States, we expect MillerCoors' cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year 2013.", "In Europe, which now combines the U.K. with Central Europe, we anticipate a low single-digit increase in pro forma cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency. Our International business anticipates cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. So in Canada, we are pleased to see the return of hockey. But due to the short lead time, we'll be unable to affect full retail activation until the fall. We expect our 2 lead brands in Canada to benefit from the renewed drive behind our innovative Aluminum Pint bottle and our new Molson Canadian advertising that went viral prior to its TV launch. We also -- we will also continue to transfer our craft beers to new regions following the success of Granville Island in Ontario last year.", "In the U.S., we will be developing our portfolio in the above-premium and craft and working to gain share in premium lights. We are planning new line extensions for Leinenkugels and Blue Moon for fall -- for summer and fall.", "In above-premium, we're also launching Redd's Apple Ale and Third Shift. In premium lights, we're investing behind new commercial properties, including multicultural for Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we'll also launch a new Miller Lite bottle in the on-premise.", "In Europe, we delivered a strong competitive performance in a tough trading environment with market share and pricing growth in all our major markets with the exception of the U.K. and Romania. We also accelerated innovation performance driven by beer mixes, strong Staropramen growth and strict overhead cost management.", "The restructuring to combine our U.K. and Ireland businesses with Central Europe has gone smoothly, enabling additional European cost savings to be delivered in 2013.", "In Hungary, we have stabilized and restructured the business under new leadership. And in Romania, which is our lowest share major market in the region, we have introduced new leadership, added sales resources, dealt with inventory overstocks and refocused the portfolio on higher-value segments.", "In the U.K, Carling-produced cider will be hitting off-premise retailer shelves next month. We are investing in new platforms for Carling to strengthen its position and enhance its performance on the bar.", "In the craft space, we have purchased the Franciscan Well brand and micro-brewery in Cork City, Republic of Ireland, to build a strong share in that craft beer market.", "Across Europe, in 2013, we will be increasing the scale of innovation and accelerating sales and marketing investment to strengthen our mainstream and premium portfolio across all major markets to drive the top line and bottom line.", "Our International business continues to focus on growth and is investing ahead of the curve in emerging markets behind a solid portfolio of Coors Light, Carling, Staropramen and Blue Moon. We anticipate that the liquidation of the China joint venture and the restructuring of the Coors Light business in the balance of China will reduce the underlying loss for this business in 2013.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the first quarter. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter increased at a mid-single-digit rate versus 2012 primarily due to year-over-year differences in the timing of pricing and promotional activity.", "In the U.S., for the first 4 weeks ended January 26, STRs were down low single digits. In Europe, our sales volume increased at a high single-digit rate for the first month of the quarter, driven partially by year-over-year differences in the timing of price increases. And in the first 4 weeks, our international STRs increased at a double-digit rate on a comparable basis. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "To summarize our discussion today, lower fourth quarter underlying earnings were driven by a higher tax rate and cycling strong quarterly results the year before, including the 53rd week in our fiscal 2012 and some other onetime factors. Full year results included higher underlying earnings and $865 million of underlying free cash flow generation.", "Our Central Europe business is being integrated very effectively and, in a different retail environment -- in a difficult retail environment, is performing very well.", "In 2013, our focus will continue to be on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy and particularly the first one, which is to grow profitably in our core businesses with brands and innovation. We also intend to pay down debt. In combination with disciplined, high-return cash use, our growth strategy is designed to drive long-term profit, cash flow and total return to our shareholders.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "And so at this point, Jay, we'd like to open it up to questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more color on Central and Eastern Europe. I think you've talked about some of the competitive dynamics in some markets. But broadly speaking, kind of what are you seeing from a macro perspective for the category as a whole? A little bit more color in terms of the markets where you're gaining share, what you're doing differently in those markets. And then just the profit decline in the fourth quarter was also a little bit surprising to me in Central Europe. So kind of from a profitability perspective, if you can help to understand what drove the decline in the quarter.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Sure. So Judy, I think I'll take the first part of the question, and I'll pass the second part on to Mark to give you the sort of granularity. I think really, we covered it off in the script. I mean, on a relative basis, this business is performing exceptionally well. As I said, we've taken market share in Bulgaria. You asked why. I mean, obviously, that's down to execution and the strength of our brands. We've got the highest market share ever in Croatia, and we've got activity coming forward there that we're very pleased about in terms of new bottles. Czech Republic, we've gained share in a difficult on-trade market and doing well generally in that market. We've grown share in every single market, apart from Romania, and Mark can speak to that in a second. And we've got double-digit growth in Staropramen, which is our -- I would say our core brand in that -- sorry, our core above-premium brand in that market. So overall, that's a very strong set in a relative difficult environment. So overall, very pleased with it. Because the results have some detail and which need explaining, so I'll pass it now over to Mark. And Mark, maybe you can make reference to what's going on in Romania as well.", "Mark Hunter", "Sure. Thanks, Peter. Judy, just a couple of builds on Peter's comments, and I'll talk specifically about the fourth quarter. I mean, I think on the Q3 call, I was very clear about the fact that we're seeing, certainly from a GDP perspective, lower growth rates than we're anticipating, and that's having a direct impact on overall beer consumption. And in fact, on a full year basis overall, there were only really 2 markets that showed any volume growth, the Romanian market and the Bulgarian market. And as Peter said, we've taken market leadership in Bulgaria, which is great news. In Romania, I mentioned in Q3 that most of the growth in that market was coming in the very low-margin value segment. We chose not to participate in Q3, and we've continued not participating through the fourth quarter, with our focus really being on our core brands and our premium brands because we believe that will give the business long-term sustainability. We actually look at the specific profit numbers in the fourth quarter. In local currency, we were down about 5%. So we've been running the business now for 2 quarters. We posted strong growth in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we're down 5% in local currency. And I took 2 decisions through the fourth quarter which impacted on that. It was clear, as the business left 2011, a significant stock had been pushed into the market in both Romania and Serbia, and I took a decision to de-stock the distribution pipeline. And that cost us in profit terms a couple of million euros. So if you actually add that back on to our Q4 numbers, then it gives us a much more solid position in the fourth quarter. And it sets us up for, I think, all of the right behaviors and actions as we move into 2013, building on the back of what has been share growth in every one of our major markets, with the exception being the Romanian market for the reason I've described. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit more color to both the profit number and just some of the volume trends.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. So -- and then just in terms of Europe, so can -- is the savings you could be getting from the integration of the U.K., Ireland and then, I guess, perhaps the further savings, Europe broadly consolidating between U.K. and the Central and Eastern Europe, can you quantify potential savings, how meaningful that could be over time?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "We will, when we update everybody at the next analyst call, Judy, which is what we promised at the last quarter. We're still in consultation in Europe. We have to go through certain regulatory hoops in terms of doing restructuring. So that consultation won't be completed until the end of March. So we're not in a position to give final details. But you can see some of the specials that we've highlighted in our earnings results this morning. So that should give you some idea or some guidance but not in so many specific numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was hoping you could review the competitive environment in Canada, particularly in the West, and the impact on your business potentially from the Qu\u00e9bec excise tax increases.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Sure, Dara. Stew, here. Just -- I'll take those separately. I mean, certainly, as we look at Qu\u00e9bec, 20% increase in taxes there will have a negative effect. And certainly, we saw it in the latter part of the fourth quarter. Difficult to say precisely what that impact is. But as price goes up, consumers will buy less. I think when you look at the West, the dynamic is different there. It's a competitive dynamic. A couple of things in play. So first, the smaller brewers have continued to extend in 2 markets there, one in the value space, where value has grown quite dramatically, and then particularly in the craft space. We're competing in both of those spaces with Keystone at the value end and with Granville Island and, to a lesser extent in the West, with Creemore at the top end. There's also -- we've seen in the West perhaps some more aggressive innovation, which came earlier in last year, which -- from competitors, which we saw coming earlier last year, which sort of flowed through the year. And if we look out to this year, we think we've got a very exciting innovation pipeline, and we're well positioned to play in the market.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then the mid-single-digit January growth in the STRs, that's a very strong rebound in Canada. But you mentioned some timing benefits. So can you give me a sense of kind of a more normalized underlying trend?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, I -- we can't really give any guidance there. But I would say that the mid-single-digit rate that you see there is not reflective of the market fundamentals, and that is largely down to the timing of promotional activities and customer buy-in. So I would -- that's the best answer I can give you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Two questions. So just clarifying what I think what Peter said. On Canada, the comment was made that, if I understood correctly, that you'd expect market share to be covering by the fall after the hockey change. I just wanted to clarify if I got that right. And equally, on the International business, was the comment made that the losses will be small in 2013? We're not expecting a return to profits that we saw in Q4?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "All right. So on Canada, Ian, what I said was that we wouldn't be able to fully activate the NHL sponsorship at the retail end until the fall because, obviously, the lead times you need with retailers and so on means that we can't put it into place some -- in sort of first half of the year. So it wasn't the market share position, it was specifically the activation against the NHL property. And yes, you were right in terms of the International business. The -- what we said was the loss would be reduced.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I mean, is it going to be fairly substantial? I mean, are we talking about the halving of the loss you had this year for 2012?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "The loss will be reduced, yes. I think that's as much as we can tell you, Ian.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just want to follow up a little bit on Dara's question in terms of Canada. And your answer there, it sounds as though, I guess, it's shipments coming in a little bit earlier. So do you think you'll be able to be positive for the quarter in terms of STRs given the strong start you had, even if it's taking volume out of the rest of the quarter? And then the second question I have...", "Unknown Executive", "Well, let's answer the first piece. I just -- I don't -- we can't give you guidance for the first quarter. I just want to draw attention to the fact that I think the number that you're seeing there is not reflective of the true market fundamentals. Some of the increase we, no doubt, will get are around hockey, for example. I mean, hockey didn't get going right until the end of January. So that's not a big influence here in the number. I just -- as we release that number, I'd like you to just make sure you understand what some of the drivers are.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then moving on to the tax rate. It's one of the things where you guys talk about the long-term tax rate and eventually it's going to go there. It hasn't moved. And in fact, because of some of things you've done, the tax rate generally has been lower. What's the right way to think about the progression on that? Is -- when it finally starts to move, is it a slow buildup over time? Is it a one-shot deal? How should we think about that in terms of longer term?", "Gavin Hattersley", "John, I would not characterize it as a one-jump deal, I think, you referred to. I think it's going to be a slow progression over time. And as I said on the call, it'll take us a few years to get there.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So 2 questions. One, first, just in terms of the hockey season this year, given the strike and the lack of ability to fully merchandise against it, do you get any rebate or any insurance? Is there any remuneration you get for not being able to fully merchandise against it?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Bryan, it sounds like you've been at a good hockey game. But I will say that we work -- clearly, one of the drivers in the fourth quarter was a reduction in some of our marketing expense related to activation around hockey, but we haven't been specific about what those numbers are that -- since that agreement is confidential.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. So that is -- that's not necessarily just not spending. That is getting some sort of remuneration for it, I guess, is what I was trying to get after?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, I can't get into any more detail, I'm sorry. But all of that stuff is reflected in total in our marketing spend. And so I guess my argument would be it doesn't really matter which side it comes from.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Well, I guess what I was -- as we're looking at modeling to the back half of 2013, were you -- we should be looking at more significant increases in marketing just because you've got an abnormally low level in the fourth quarter? I guess that's what...", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "I would say that, that is true in the fourth quarter. We had an unusually low level in the fourth quarter. But again, we also had much lower volumes. So we would naturally take those kinds of steps.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right, right. Understood. And then just a second question more broadly. We've had a couple of big acquisitions on the tape this morning. And just in general, given the low financing environment, it just seems like it's a market that's pretty conducive to M&A. I know that you're still digesting StarBev, but just -- could you just talk more broadly about kind of what your perspective is on M&A, on the environment, your willingness to look at things today?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Sure. As you said, since we did the StarBev acquisition, we're very focused on paying down debt and maintaining our investment grade. So that really is what we're focused on. If there is some small infills in terms of portfolio fills or whatever, we would be interested and would look at that. But if you're talking about major M&A activity, that's not something that's on our agenda in the short term.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to the presenters.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Well, thank you, everybody, for participating. And I look forward to speaking to you again at the end of the next quarter.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results that the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year period and in U.S. dollars.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thank you, Candice. Hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.", "With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors's CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors's Chief Legal and People Officer; Zahir Ibrahim, Molson Coors's Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors's VP of Investor Relations.", "On the earnings call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2013 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective of the remainder of 2013.", "Our first quarter numbers include the effect of the Central Europe acquisition that we completed in the middle of last year. Because of this addition, we recorded volume and sales increases but a posttax income decline. The decline was driven by 3 months in Central Europe debt-servicing costs being allocated against our lowest earnings quarter of the year in that region, along with foreign exchange losses and increased marketing spend across the rest of the business.", "As reported by others, weather affected volumes in all of our markets. Against this backdrop, we grew share in Europe, saw relatively flat share in the U.S. and lost share in Canada. Our innovation programs got off to a fast start and reflects a pipeline that is both full and exciting. In the U.S., our portfolio transformation strategy delivered growth in domestic net revenue per hectoliter of 4%, the largest quarterly percentage increase in 4 years.", "Also, Nielsen results indicate that we gained share in each key segment in the first quarter, and we achieved initial success with the national brand launches of Redd's Apple Ale and Third Shift Amber Lager. Coors Light grew market share, while Miller Lite declined. Overall, we again achieved market share growth in the Premium Light segment.", "In Canada, the substantial excise tax increase in Qu\u00e9bec last November impacted volumes this quarter. Our business was disproportionally affected because of our high market share in Qu\u00e9bec. Late in the quarter, we relaunched the Aluminum Pint bottle and launched Molson Canadian Wheat. In Europe, we grew overall share, driven in particular by the strength of our brands in the U.K., Bulgaria, Croatia and the Czech Republic. Our core plus and premium portfolio performed strongly, with Staropramen, Coors Light, Doom Bar and Cobra all in growth in the first quarter.", "Carling, our largest brand in Europe, also grew in the first quarter. The integration of our U.K. and Central Europe businesses is progressing well, and we are on track to deliver the synergies related to the Central Europe acquisition as well as cost reductions associated with the U.K. restructuring.", "As a result, pro forma underlying results in Europe improved significantly. In international, we achieved strong volume growth in Latin America and India, and we also introduced Staropramen Unfiltered in Sweden during the quarter.", "So with that as an initial overview, I'll turn it over to Gavin to give first quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the balance of 2013. Gavin?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors's first quarter underlying aftertax earnings decreased 36% to $54.6 million or $0.30 per share. This decline was driven by the inclusion of operating losses in 3 months of debt service this year from Central Europe acquisition in the lowest sales and profit quarter of the year. Results a year ago did not include these impacts.", "This year, negative foreign exchange of $6 million on a pretax basis also contributed to lower results, along with weak economic conditions and challenging weather.  Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors increased more than 20% due to the addition of Central Europe results. As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results, with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business.", "On this basis, total company net sales increased 10.4% in the first quarter, driven by the inclusion of the Central Europe business along with growth in the United States. Despite pricing growth across all markets, net sales on a per hectoliter basis decreased 6.8% in the quarter due to the addition of Central Europe sales and a lower net sales per hectoliter rate.", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 4.5% due to the addition of Central Europe, which has a lower cost structure than our other businesses, partially offset by higher cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada.", "Total company gross margin was 36.4%, 150 basis points lower than a year ago, primarily due to higher cost of sales in Canada, including a higher brand investments captured in this line. Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 10.2% due to the addition of Central Europe results and investments for national brand launches by MillerCoors.", "Underlying operating margin was 7.3%, down 170 basis points from a year ago, driven by higher Canada cost of goods sold, increased brand investments and the addition of Central Europe MG&A, which were partially offset by positive pricing and cost savings.", "Looking specifically at our New York segment on a pro forma basis, which includes the U.K. and Central Europe for this year and last year, this business improved financial performance substantially. Overall market share was higher, pricing increased across the region, and cost savings were achieved. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "It is important to note that our first quarter underlying results exclude some special and other noncore gains, losses and expenses that net to a $21.9 million pretax charge. These exclusions from our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to unrealized foreign exchange and fair value adjustments associated with the EUR 500 million convertible notes issued as part of the Central Europe acquisition, along with restructuring charges in Europe and Canada.  These special and other noncore items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "Underlying free cash flow for the first quarter of 2013 totaled a use of $49 million. This was a $30 million lower cash use versus a year ago and was driven by a significant improvement in working capital, which was partially offset by higher capital spending, pension contributions and cash income taxes, all of which were anticipated.", "Net free cash use in the first quarter of the year is normal in this seasonal business, but this is at the lowest profit- and cash-generating time of the year. Our first quarter 2013 free cash use was made up of the following factors: $180 million of operating cash flow, which includes $117 million for MillerCoors; plus $10 million of net add-backs of Central Europe acquisition-related costs and restructuring payments. Investing cash outflows were $68 million of capital spending and $109 million of cash invested in MillerCoors.", "Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $4.65 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $512 million, resulting in net debt of $4.14 billion, approximately $100 million higher than 3 months earlier due to seasonal cash use.", "Looking forward to the full year, our full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter: underlying free cash flow of $700 million, plus or minus 10%; defined-benefit pension expense and contributions, which are expected to be approximately $50 million of expense and $150 million of cash contributions, including 42% of MillerCoors; capital spending of about $330 million for the year; corporate MG&A expense at approximately $105 million, excluding foreign exchange movements; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $170 million; underlying effective tax rate changes of 16% to 20% for this full year and 20% to 24% on a longer-term basis; and cost of goods sold per hectoliter for each of our businesses, with the U.S. up at a low single-digit rate, Canada up mid-single digits on a local currency basis, Europe up low single digits on a local currency basis and International up low single digits for the full year.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for regional outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. In the U.S., our share performance was improved across key segments, and our net revenue per hectoliter growth is the strongest it's been for 4 years.", "For the third straight year, we're increasing our investment in innovation, and we are focusing that innovation on the biggest, highest-potential opportunities and the most profitable parts of the U.S. beer market. We will see new activity behind Coors Light and Miller Lite. And in Craft, we are planning new line extensions for Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon for summer and the fall. In above-premium, we're building on the initial success of launching Redd's, Third Shift and Batch 19 nationally.", "In Canada, we look forward to the hockey playoffs in key markets in the weeks ahead, along with full retail activation for the new season this fall. Going forward, we have a strong innovation program following the rollout of Molson Canadian Wheat. This will include the launch of Molson Canadian Cider in select markets this summer and Rickard's Shandy. Along with our innovative Aluminum Pint bottle, we also expect our 2 lead brands in Canada, Coors Light and Molson Canadian, to benefit from further packaging innovation ahead of the summer selling season.", "In Europe, Romania, Serbia and Hungary are on a firmer foot than just a few months ago, with trade inventories at better levels and the elimination of some low-margin package configurations. Staropramen is growing strongly across our Central Europe markets, and Carling grew volume and share in the U.K. The innovation agenda across Europe is accelerating, with Carling Cider now in market in the U.K. and performing in line with expectations.", "We are also broadening our Carling Zest portfolio with the launch of a ginger variant, and we are extending our beer mix offerings across Central Europe with the introduction of a cider mix and 3 new flavors.", "Additionally, we are launching  [indiscernible] Super Dry in Hungary, Carling in Croatia and Molson Canadian in Ireland. Our International business continues to focus on growth and is investing ahead of the curve in high-opportunity emerging markets behind a solid portfolio of Coors Light, Carling and Staropramen.  This business is on course and continued to drive growth in our key brands in the quarter. For the balance of 2013, we will expand into select markets and reduce our investment per hectoliter as we drive our international group to profitability over the medium term.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter: In the U.S., for the 4 weeks ended April 27, STRs were down mid-single digits. In Canada, our sales-to-retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter decreased at mid-single digits. In Europe, our sales volume increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the first month of the quarter, with growth in all our key markets apart from the Czech Republic, which experienced unseasonably cold weather. And in the first 4 weeks, our international sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "So to summarize our discussion today, our first quarter numbers include the effect of Central Europe acquisition that we completed in the middle of last year, which increased volume and sales but decreased income because of the seasonality of the business. Foreign exchange, brand investment and weather also affected our business. Against this backdrop, we grew share in Europe, saw relatively flat share in the U.S. and lost share in Canada.", "Our innovation pipeline is full, and related programs are off to a fast start. In the remainder of 2013, our focus will continue to be on the 3 pillars of our growth strategy, and particularly the first one, which is to grow profitably in our core businesses through brands and innovation. We also intend to pay down debt. In combination with disciplined cash use, our growth strategy is designed to drive long-term profit cash flow and total return for our shareholders.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. Our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon.

This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "And so at this point, Candice, we'd like to open it up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So in Canada, the pricing increase in the quarter was weaker than we've seen in the last couple of years. Can you just give us some detail on what drove that softness and the competitive environment in general in Canada? And also, your expectations as we look out for the balance of the year?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Sure. Dara, it's Stewart Glendinning here. Well, we won't give any forecast, of course, for the balance of the year related to pricing. But if you look back at this past quarter, yes, 1% was not strong pricing. I will say it was positive, which is good news. There were parts of the country that were more aggressive and competitive than others. Certainly, I think, if we looked at the Atlantic region, we saw a lot of promotions there. And particularly in BC, we saw higher levels of promotional volume in that province. Qu\u00e9bec saw actually strong pricing, which came on top of the back -- on the back of also increased taxes, and the combination of those things affected volume in the province. Ontario was broadly in line with our average.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And do you think some of that promotional environment lingers as we look at the balance of the year, or was it more just kind of tactical within Q1, especially given some of the volume weakness in industry?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, it's hard to say what will happen in pricing because it is so dynamic and because we don't give any forecast on that. I will say that beer is, against other markets, relatively expensive in Canada, and it is a very competitive market. So we'll see what takes place over the balance of the year.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then up in Canada, you've been struggling from a market share standpoint the last couple of years here after really having nice outperformance prior to that. So what do you think has been the main issue from a market share standpoint? And some of this packaging innovation and other focus you mentioned in the balance of the year, does that really help you start to close this market share gap or even start to outperform at some point?", "Andrew T. Molson", "Of course, we are focused on driving the best possible answer for our shareholders, and a big part of that is market share. I think if you look back at the history of what's taken place in -- from a market share perspective, it's been most of the -- gains have come at the -- on the back of gains in wines primarily and also in the smaller brewers, those 2 impacts. Specifically, against the smaller brewers, that pressure has come both on the value end and in domestic above-premium. On the value end, you will have seen a push very hard this year with Keystone into a number of markets, also looking to be very competitive on our existing legacy brands. And I'm pleased to say that in value in this quarter, we saw a gain in share. On the above-premium side, we've been very successful there both in terms of Rickard's, Canadian 67, some of our higher-priced products, along with our craft offerings in Creemore and Granville Island. Again, we have seen those brands growing. But if you look at the shape of our portfolio, we are under-indexed in that above-premium segment and we're under- indexed in value. And so as some of those segments have seen growth, we have lost share. Now if you look at the balance of the year, so what should you expect? First of all, as I mentioned, we are pushing hard in both of the segments we're under-indexed in, and we've seen positive results there. As it relates to the mainstream part of our business, a lot of new innovation coming in the remainder of the year. Molson Canadian Wheat has been released; Cider is going to be in the marketplace; on the above-premium side, Shandy. So there's some news now coming into the market, which I think is going to be helpful for us as we look at the back part of the year.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with UBS.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, if I could follow up on Canada a little bit. It's -- there's been some challenges, but we're still talking about growth rates from a volume perspective in the single digit. Can you give some context on the impact of the deleverage, because the down -- the degree to which profit was down was quite high versus what we saw in terms of volume, and especially, the offset that pricing should support?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Sure.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "[indiscernible] just for clarity, there wasn't growth in Canada. There was growth on NSR. The market was down about 0.8% and we were down about 1.4% in volume terms. So Stewart, do you want to pick it up from there?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, certainly. So thanks for clarifying that point. Of course, negative volumes do drive deleverage. And I think if you'd just reflect on our COGS, Kaumil, COGS were up just under 6%. About 1/3 of that was related to deleverage in mix, so giving you a sense of the kind of impact that, that can have on the results.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, about 1/3. And if we were to see -- as we get into the larger quarters, does that 1/3 shrink substantially if we're talking about the same volume numbers?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "We're not going to break that down for the rest of the year. We have given you some guidance on what COGS looks like for the rest of the year, which is up mid-single digits. And obviously, each quarter, we'll report out on, specifically, what drove the quarter.", "Kaumil S. Gajrawala - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got it. And then on taxes, if -- I know you still have -- you've given us guidance for this year, but as we could think a little bit long term, obviously, your taxes seem to be -- have been structurally quite low to date. Do they stay there? Do they need to -- or will they creep up to a, just closer to a mid-20s as we go forward?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, I'll pass you on to Gavin for that in a second. But obviously, just to sort of build a little bit on Stewart's answer. Directionally, you're obviously right, because as the volumes increase, the fixed costs remain exactly where they are. So we would expect that to be a lower figure going forward.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes, on tax, Kaumil, the 16% to 20% for this year is the guidance that we're holding to. I mean, the first quarter, as I said -- as I think we said in our release, we did have a discrete tax item, which drove a benefit in a very low-profit quarter. So we're sticking to the 16% to 20%. And yes, it's going to take us 3 years for us to get to the 20% to 24% level. So we will come off to 16% to 20% in the years ahead.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess I wanted to also just follow on Canada. And just kind of stepping back, this is a market where obviously, from a profitability perspective, you've struggled a bit. And I think you're still committed to growing your core markets in a profitable manner. So to the extent that you can talk about some of the things that you can control more on the cost side, what is the sense of urgency to really get some of those cost savings? And can you maybe talk about some of the opportunities, regardless of really what happens on the volume side?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. So thanks for that, Judy. Look, let's start with the urgency. I mean, there's a high sense of urgency in our business generally to ensure that we are as cost-competitive as possible. I think if you looked at our operating margins relative to those of some of our competitive set, you'll conclude that there are some differences. Some of those differences are driven by the structure of our partner brands. But we are pretty clear that when we look at other areas of our cost structure, that they are driven by choices that we're making. And so we are actively looking at what changes can be made there. Sorry, could you just give me the other part of your question?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I think it's just related to that. I mean, what are some of the things that you can actually -- you've made choices to control? And maybe you can even quantify what you think are the components of your cost structure that you can control, and what are the buckets of those opportunities?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, I mean, I think -- yes, so thank you for that. I think, look at -- broadly speaking, it's going to break down both into COGS and G&A. And you could run some comparisons between us and others and see those gaps. I can't really get into the specific of -- by line item. But broadly, we're focused on the 2 components of G&A and COGS. On the bright side, I mean, I would look at this most recent quarter. And specific to the COGS line item, we fully offset all of the inflationary impacts that we saw in the quarter with ongoing cost savings. So cost savings are an active part of our agenda. And in fact, if you looked at some of our just broad G&A this quarter, it is lower than last year. And that's because we have fewer people. So I don't want to leave you with the impression that nothing's been done. In fact, a number of things have been done. But looking forward, we expect that there's more ground to cover.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a clarification on the pricing. So in Canada, you said it was up 1% per hectoliter. How much of that was mix versus price, pricing? And then, as you're kind of launching some of these higher-cost packaging, are you not just getting enough maybe mix improvement to kind of offset some of that, some of the higher costs because of the competitive environment? Or -- I guess I'm just wondering because it seems like the mix is a more negative on the cost side, but not necessarily flowing through on the positive to the pricing side.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "You got it. Well, I mean, look, first of all, on -- just to address mix. When you look at the mix impacts, there's a couple of things going on. There's brand mix. Depending on the brand, that will influence cost, if it's partner brand or not a partner brand. I think if you looked at some of the higher-priced new product we're putting in, of course, our starting point is to try to ensure that we capitalize on higher-priced, more attractive and premium products to increase our margin on those. As it relates to other mix impacts in the market, an important dynamic to just understand is that broadly, across the market, there is a shift between bottles and -- from bottles to cans, cans being a more expensive packaging mix. And those prices are going to be somewhat managed by the market. Depending on where competition goes, we'll need to be competitive. So if I look back, I can see some periods where you'd like to get more margin on the can, but actually the competitive benchmark that's been set is putting some pressure on that. So a mix. So in some cases, you're getting more for that expensive product, and in some cases, not.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then my final question, just on the European segment. I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color just in terms of the cost savings you're getting, both on the synergy side as well as the savings that you're getting from the restructuring?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "We'll bring everyone up to speed a bit more at the analyst conference, Judy. But safe to say, as we said in the script, we're absolutely comfortable with where we are in terms of the synergies that we're driving out compared to the business case that we explained to you when we bought the Central European business. And equally, we're getting all of the cost savings that we expected to get from the restructuring in the U.K. as well.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Your performance in Europe looks very good compared with some of the other reporting we've seen. Volume's always minus 1% and then up in April, and a very healthy price mix, 5%. I'd like to have a bit more color, particularly on that price mix, how it's been achieved by market? Is it merely price mix, and how does it vary, as I say, across markets?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Mark, do you want to take that?", "Mark Hunter", "Sure. I mean, what I'm not going to do is delve into every market, for obvious reasons. But if you look across Europe, on a pan-European basis, pricing's up just under about 5% on a local currency basis. And that's split pretty equally between mix and between price, net price improvements. So we're seeing the right kind of channel and pack improvements, and we're getting headline pricing coming through as well. I think on the volume front, overall industry was down just under a couple of points, a couple of percentage points. The interesting thing is that on our last call, I explained that Romania was probably blurring some of the industry performance because there's been pretty significant growth in that market, all driven in the very low-margin value segment. If you actually strip Romania out of the industry numbers, industry is down about 3% or so. And I think that really kind of emphasizes the strong performance we've seen across the majority of our markets. The U.K. is growing strongly. We've seen record shares in Bulgaria. We were #1 in Croatia. We were #1 in the Czech Republic, where we've recorded our highest-ever off-premise share. And the good news is, in both Romania and Hungary, which have been a bit more challenged, we're pretty confident that we've got those markets stabilized, and we're focusing our investment on higher-margin parts of the market. So really trying to work across each market on a market-by-market basis to give that aggregate improvement that you've seen, but I can't really go into any more detail within each of the markets, for obvious reasons.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just following up -- I mean, overall -- because I thought you gained share in the region. And I'm just thinking about the markets where that's happened, it sounds like Romania, probably, you didn't, because the growth was large-pack PET. Is that the one that you didn't gain share in or...", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, and to be fair, the major markets we did grow share in. So the U.K., Bulgaria, Croatia and then the Czech Republic. In Serbia, Romania and Hungary, we've been working actively to actually get our stock in market, held by the distributors back to what I call more normal levels. That process is pretty much complete now, and we're feeling much more confident about the relationship between our supply and the demand in the marketplace. But we certainly gave up some share in Hungary and Romania, albeit both of those markets are very challenged from a unit margin perspective.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.", "Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just provide a little bit more clarity on how we should expect your debt paydown to proceed this year and whether you have an objective for where your leverage should be at year end?", "Gavin Hattersley", "From a debt leverage point of view, let me start with that. I mean, over the next 3 years, we've -- our stated objective is to get our leverage levels back to where they were pre-acquisition of StarBev. So depending on which rating agency you ask, we were either in the mid- to the high-tier levels. So that would be our medium-term or 3-year goal to get to that level by 2015. We have 2 debt coming up -- or 2 items of debt coming up in 2013. One is the euro convertible, which was done at the time of the deal. And that can be put on us by CBC anytime between 14 March, which obviously has passed, and the middle of December, but that will settle this year. And then the other one is the $575 million convertible, which is due in July. We have recently, as you would have seen from our financial filings, put in place a commercial paper program, which we were using to fund those 2 debt payoffs, including the cash resources we've got.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vivien Azer with Citi.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "My first question has to do with Europe. I'm trying to reconcile 2 comments that you made. I heard you say, I think, that you wanted to invest ahead of growth in that region, but at the same time, target a reduction in your investment spend per hectoliter. Can you help me reconcile those 2 comments, please?", "Krishnan Anand", "Well I think the comment that Peter made in the script -- this is Kandy. That was on the International business. I think what they're doing on International business is investing in high-growth markets and -- but at the same time because our growth in terms of volume is higher than the growth in our investment, we are decreasing our investment per hectoliter. And that's been consistent over the years, and we intend to continue to do that until we can start contributing to profitability in the medium term.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, just to build on that. I guess, the 2 comments -- I mean, at the macro level, we are investing ahead of the curve. So we're investing in long-term growth, but at the moment, that's costing us money. So we are investing ahead of the curve as far as the businesses concerned. That investment, as it pays off, means that we grow the business. And as the volume grows, then our costs -- our costs reduce because increased margin is spread across the whole system, if that make sense.", "Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "No, it definitely does. That's great. In terms of the Canadian market, not to belabor the point, but as I think about some of the industry dynamics and the updated number that you've offered for April, I'm curious if you can kind of tease out what the kind of onetime shock was from a price increase versus a weak consumer versus maybe just volume shifting to other categories as you kind of unpack the components of the overhang on volumes for the industry?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "There's a couple of things, I think. I mean, first of all, don't forget that for all of our numbers, with possibly the exception of Romania, which has a different calendar, Easter fell in the first quarter this year as opposed to the second quarter. So our second quarter numbers are affected by the comparison against Easter, that's point 1. I wouldn't personally get wrapped around the axle too much on small details of what happens in the first quarter in a relatively small volume and profit period. I think Stewart outlined the structural issues in Canada which we have to deal. And they are that structurally, the growth areas are above-premium and value. And what we're doing about that is that we've done a lot of work on value. We've had a best-value performance for quite a long time and actually grew market share in value, but we under-indexed. We also under-indexed in above-premium. Again, although we've had a good period in above-premium, we under-indexed. Within that, we're trying to keep our core brands moving forward. Canadian had a relatively good period. We've got a lot of innovation coming through. So what really is what we're doing about it, I think Stewart was pushing into, and what we're doing about it is we're going to continue to put pressure on that value segment so that we get closer to our fair share, but also, in above-premium, develop on the brands that we've already got in terms of Creemore, Granville Islands. But also, if you look at the innovation programs that Stewart talked about with Cider and with Rickard's Shandy coming through Canadian we just launched, we believe we're pushing all the right buttons to make sure that, that structural issue with which we're dealing is being addressed. Very similar to what we're trying to do in the U.S., if you look at it.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess, Mark, a couple of questions on Central and Eastern Europe. First, on the level of brand spending. Generally, can you speak to where we are in that evolution? Shortly after you purchased StarBev, you spoke about what we've seen, this pickup in spend levels. And it seems to be working out in terms of the share performance. Where are we in that evolution, in your opinion? And can you give us some sense, as you've picked up the rate of spend, how much has been on the trade side of things, and how much has been more on the pull/consumer side of things?", "Mark Hunter", "Sure. I don't think we ever said that there was a specific start point and end point in terms of the evolution of spending. We are committed to growing our brand portfolio with a focus on core, core plus, above-premium and innovation. And that's where we are investing. Investment, this year, is up on last year. I don't think we've given specific details on that, and we're clearly phasing that as we work our way through the year. So we're committed to invest more to build the strength of the portfolio. And as you say, that's demonstrating, I think, its value, particularly on major markets where we are seeing our share growth come through. The spend increase is balanced pretty equally between what I describe as direct-to-consumer and consumer-via-customer. And at the moment, the direct-to-consumer spend does take the biggest proportion, and both are growing roughly equally. If anything, there's an emphasis towards direct-to-consumer spend. And that's particularly to support the innovation agenda. As I think Peter and Gavin mentioned earlier, we've got Carling Cider, Carling Zest, Molson Canadian, Carling Lager going to Croatia,  [indiscernible] Super Dry, 3 new beer mix flavors, the Franciscan Well acquisition in the Republic of Ireland. So the innovation focus and the above-premium and core plus focus with Staropramen, et cetera is, I think, paying dividends. So we will invest wisely and ensure that, that investment is phased and paced at a level which demonstrates a return. And I think that's what we've managed, certainly, to do as we've got off to a relatively strong start to this year.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful. And I didn't hear any Scotland innovations there, Mark. When's that going to come?", "Mark Hunter", "All of the above are relevant for Scotland.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. And then if I could, you also called out several other countries there in Central Europe as having a better macro picture than you've seen in the past. Can you speak generally to what you're seeing in terms of consumer behavior and how it's unfolding versus what we've seen in the last few years?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, I mean, I think it's fair to say, across the majority of the European markets, GDP estimates, which -- actual GDP numbers through 2012 were anything from flat to minus 2, 2.5 points. They've improved slightly on a 2013 outlook basis, but they're still running kind of flat to negative, albeit a slight improvement. So I'm going to say, I'm certainly bullish from an overall economic perspective and from a consumer demand perspective. And the fact that we've seen industry volume across the markets in aggregate down a couple of points, and as I mentioned earlier, slightly higher than excluding Romania, would suggest that we're going to have to keep a real focus on not only the top line, through pricing and innovation, but continuing to manage our cost base very effectively. And again, as Peter mentioned, the cost-reduction plan in the U.K. is running bang in line with schedule, and we are being very tight with costs across the rest of our business.", "Hiroshi Saji - Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd., Research Division", "And finally, on the U.K., Carling you mentioned is picking up share. You're still getting reasonable price mix growth in that market. Can you speak to what's going on with Carling in the U.K. And give us any sense of any divergence between channels across your portfolio in the U.K., on and off trade share trends?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, I mean, I think -- to cut to the chase on this, our on-premise performance with Carling has been very solid for the last few years. The major volatility we've seen has principally been around the off-premise channel, and I think we were pretty transparent last year when we said we were out of play with one of the majors from a promotional calendar perspective. The good news is that we've started this year, and Carling us in play across all of the major multiple grocers. And we're feeling, I think, as positive as we can about the opportunity for Carling this year to really kind of get back into a growth spurt, particularly on the core Carling brand where we've got new Carling creative platform, which is going to be released relatively soon and on the back of the innovation agenda, Zest was very successful last year. It's continuing to grow, and Carling Cider is now in market, and there'll be a further Carling addition in July of this year with one of our major customers. So probably feeling as optimistic about Carling as we have done for the last couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Just want to circle back on the U.S. The question centers around shelf space. So first of all, can you think about where you guys are able to place Redd's and Third Shift, where that's taking shelf space from? And then just a little bit more broadly, what you're seeing from shelf space in terms of -- is some of the pressure on the mainstream and sub-premiums coming from reductions in shelf space to benefit the high end?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Tom, can I pass it over to you for the detail?", "Tom Long", "Sure. Redd's is positioned beside Mike's Hard Lemonade. It's price-pointed there. Every now and again, it's put near ciders. We prefer it to be in the FMB section, and it's done quite well there. So that's net new space for us, and that's one of the reasons for the placement, as I mentioned. The premium light space is generally not challenged too much. It's actually the economy space that's been challenged in shelf sets by all the above-premiums.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. One, because I may have missed this, just had you updated at all your outlook for capital spending and free cash flows here?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, we did. Gavin can give you that now.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Bryan, we just reaffirmed what we said in the first quarter call where 2013 free cash flow will be -- underlying basis will be $700 million, plus or minus 10%. And our capital line will be $330 million, which is higher than last year, obviously, because of the addition of our Central Europe business. But both of those are unchanged.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then I guess just more broadly, Peter, if you could give us a little bit of perspective on -- it was about 1 year ago where you articulated really the driver, the need to begin to drive more innovation and basically start to drive more consistent sales growth. And I think in this quarter, you certainly -- it looks like you gained share in Europe. And the mix is -- you've seen some evidence of the mix improvement in the U.S. So I think there's a bit of attention in the market right now about whether going forward, the market wants to see Molson Coors sort of generate a lot more cost savings and maybe there's less of a focus on the sales growth, but on the other hand, you've got a strategy where you really -- I think you've articulated, you really need to start driving the sales growth in order to drive the bottom line. So can you give a little perspective on kind of where you feel today about some of that investment, is it beginning to -- you're beginning to feel comfortable that it's beginning to show up in the results, first? And then second, is it possible to have a model where you're focused on cost, but also driving the top line of the same time?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Let me take the second part, first, Bryan. The answer to that is absolutely yes, it has to be. And we continue to do that. And I think Stewart outlined earlier with confidence, and we'll talk more in the investor meeting, but we are confident that -- on the cost saving line. So put that to one side, let's start off with the facts, okay, and let's just look at what we talked about this quarter. If you try and segment it, without going into any more detail, Europe, I think, anyone would accept as a very strong performance. In the U.S., I would argue the underlying fundamentals are very strong. We've got NSR growth of 4%. Our share performance is the best that we've seen probably for about 4 years. And we started off with a very strong innovation program with the outline of the strong innovation program to come. International, we've laid out over the years. We've told you exactly where we're going to get to, and we're bang in line on that program. We're not happy with Canada at the moment. There's some structural reasons for that position, but they're just excuses. We told you where the -- where we believe the weaknesses are and what we're doing to address them. We feel good about the movement we're making on value. We've got more work to do on above-premium, but we've got a strong innovation program coming out and our core brands are performing relatively well. So when you look forward, the real question, I think, is what is going to happen at the macro level with industry demand? And the short answer to that is we don't know the absolute difference between how much of our volume's been affected by weather and how much has been affected by consumer indifference. We believe -- we don't know, we believe a significant amount is down to the weather. And as that improves, then we think we're extremely well positioned to go forward in most of our markets on the basis of that which I've outlined. And Canada is still a work in progress, but we're very confident that we know where we need to look. So really, the best as I can, that would be my summary, Bryan.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And just fair to say, over the last years, you've -- again, going back to the point at your Investor Day, I guess, last year in March where you articulated sort of the strategy in terms of spending -- invest more in the top line. Despite the weather being bad, despite a strike in Canada and the things you really can't control, it hasn't really affected your rate of investment, right? You've invested, and if the macro gets better, you're there in a position to kind of pick that up as the macro gets better. You haven't -- it hasn't really affected your approach to that investment?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "No, it hasn't. And again, I think you've seen the numbers we've talked about. I mean, we had a high level of investment in the U.S. just before Christmas. We followed that on with a high-level investment in our innovation program. We talked about increased marketing spend in Canada and in Europe. We've talked about investments in our innovation program going forward. So I think the facts are there for you to see that. And again, I'd come back to the point that, if you look at where we were structurally when we talked to you back in March and you look at the business structurally now, I would -- I believe we're in a stronger position. It has  -- the first quarter was affected by consumer demand. You and I can have a view on how much of that is weather and how much is fundamental consumer demand, but we believe that the fundamentals of the business are strong, as I've outlined.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering, now that you've had StarBev for a little while, I'm wondering if you can just kind of reflect on where there's been positive surprises and negative surprises as you look at things? And second, the Staropramen just is a wonderful brand, it's a great beer. Any thoughts in terms of bringing that to the U.S.? You talked about being under-indexed at the high end. That could be a really nice superpremium import.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Robert, I'll take the high-level answer to that, and I'll let Mark fill in on some of the others. And then Kandy can talk about Staropramen in the U.S. So the high level, really, in terms of the business case and the due diligence that we did on Central Europe, we've had no nasty surprises. And if anything, they've been positive. The only issue that's affected the overall performance of the business versus the business case is what Mark referred to earlier. We had various projections in terms of GDP for the various countries. And by and large, those projections, we're seeing, in hindsight, they did seem to be optimistic. But over and above that, the absolute structure in terms of what we thought we were getting, where we thought we might have issues, specifically Romania and Hungary, the opportunities in terms of Staropramen, innovation, putting -- premiumizing the business, they've all really come to fruition. So we're very pleased and satisfied that what we expected to happen has really happened. Mark, any builds on that?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, probably just 2 or 3 things to touch on. You asked a question about positives and negatives. I have to say, the list of negatives would be very short. Probably the Romanian and Hungarian market are more challenging than we anticipated, but we've been dealing with that. We've made some changes to our leadership teams there, and we've got a very clear plan of action, which we're now executing. If you leave that to one side, I think on the positives, we're very pleased with the talent accretion that we've seen on our business. Some very, very capable leaders who are adding a lot of value. And there's a real focus within the business from what I would describe as an operational excellence perspective, both in supply chain, and we're now taking the best of the StarBev systems, integrating that with the Molson Coors legacy systems to create something, which is even more powerful. And that's already starting to be rolled across the supply chain network to really drive further efficiency and effectiveness. And in the area of commercial, the commercial excellence program that exists is being, to use our internal language, lifted and shifted back into other parts of the Molson Coors organization, particularly the U.K. and in Canada. So a real focus on trying to drive further executional effectiveness right at the front end of our business. The one area where I think we are adding value within the StarBev business, in particular, is really just trying to give the business more of a medium to long-term focus to really balance that short-term operational excellence orientation. So we're, I think, in a great place actually in terms of blending the kind of longer-term perspective, the brand and innovation focus that we have more broadly across Molson Coors with the real kind of operational excellence focus that exists within the StarBev business. And I have to say, having been in the business now for 10 months, I feel very good about what we've acquired and what we're creating here. With regard to your question on the Staropramen, that's a slightly complicated because of the existing MillerCoors relationship and an existing distributor relationship that's been in place for Staropramen in the U.S. But we are -- we agree with your sentiment on the brand, and we're working our way through how we could activate that. And Peter, I don't know whether you want to comment on that further?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, thanks, Mark. Kandy?", "Krishnan Anand", "Robert, first, we are really pleased that you like Staropramen. We think it's a fabulous beer, too. Certainly, my favorite these days. As Mark mentioned, the reason we have not moved Staropramen on to our MillerCoors system is because of an existence of a longer-term importer contract that we have with an importer here in the U.S. So we've agreed with MillerCoors to continue to build this brand, at least, during the remaining term of this longer-term contract. And we've just started working now with this importer to really build the brand step-by-step and make it available in the right way, in the right markets, in the right bars. It's going to be -- it's like a slow-burn craft brand, but we will build it with this importer as part of our overall export growth business for Staropramen.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Well, thank you, Candice. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today and for the questions. And we look forward to speaking to you at our analyst conference in New York in June.

I really appreciate it. Hello, and welcome, everybody. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2013 follow-up earnings conference call.", "Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our regular earnings conference call with Peter Swinburn, Gavin Hattersley and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.", "So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. First of all, a special welcome to Kevin Kim, who joined the company 3 months ago as our new Investor Relations Manager. Today, we also have Spencer Schurr, Finance Forecasting Manager; Brian Tabolt, Senior Director of Technical and SEC Accounting; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax.", "As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, in the second quarter, our company delivered double-digit underlying profit growth, driven by earnings accretion from the Central Europe acquisition in June of last year, as well as improved financial performance in our Europe and International businesses, along with a lower tax rate. We also generated strong underlying EBITDA and free cash flow and reduced our net debt by $373 million in the quarter. We delivered these results despite weak consumer demand across all of our markets.", "As discussed 2 months ago during our New York Investor Day, we are focused on the drivers that matter most in our business. These are driving strong core brand performance; leveraging our value-added innovation pipeline; increasing our share of above-premium sales; capturing significant, sustainable cost savings; and allocating cash via our disciplined tax-centered process that builds long-term shareholder value. In the remainder of the year, we expect consumer demand to remain weak. Despite this, we plan to increase our marketing investments behind our core brands and innovation in order to drive long-term total returns for our shareholders.", "And with that, Kyle, we'd like to open it up for questions. Over to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I wanted to go back to pricing in Canada, and I apologize if you've given all these numbers. I don't know if I caught everything. But so the negative 0.5% revenue per barrel, how much of that was price versus mix?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. So price was positive 1% and then slightly more than offset by negative 1.5% mix. And mix includes, by the way, things like geographic mix, product mix, segment mix, that sort of thing.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And I know you talked about value growing faster. Can you give us the actual percentage numbers for value versus your premium?", "David Dunnewald", "No, not a separate number. But we did see growth in the economy brands ahead of -- well, actually, no, we'll give you at least a broad brush. Our economy brands were roughly flat in the quarter. As you know, the [indiscernible].", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Economy, right, okay. And within premium -- so in your portfolio, I think some of the brand performance you've cited were Molson Canadian, down 2%, 2.5%?", "David Dunnewald", "Cited where?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I think in the press release, so sales volume for Molson Coors -- sorry, so you didn't give the -- do you have any other brand information, Coors Light, Molson Canadian?", "David Dunnewald", "Not specific numbers, no. We did say that we were pleased with the performance of the Molson Canadian brands in the quarter. Coors Light performance was not quite as strong as we've seen earlier in the year, partially driven by overlapping the introduction of Coors Light Iced T a year ago, which we include in those numbers.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, all right. And then on Canada, so the cost per hectoliter increased more than 6%. I'm just trying to also just go through the drivers and quantify some of the drivers. You talked about the asset write-down as a big factor. How much was mix versus some of the others, like input cost inflation and fixed cost deleveraging?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, there -- that's a good question, Judy. There are different ways, of course, to sort of bucket things. But what we mentioned was that asset writeoffs were about 1/3 of the increase, which was just over 6% per hectoliter in local currency in the quarter. So about 1/3 of it was asset writeoffs, things like equipment or obsolete inventory, that sort of thing. And then, beyond that, we had some incremental costs related to in-case promotions. That was about another 1/3 of the increase. And then, finally, you have fixed cost deleverage and a bit of mix as well as the last 1/3.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so the full year guidance being kind of in the mid-single-digit level does imply the back half moderates. And is that primarily because of the asset writeoff being really more of a one-off?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. Certainly, asset writeoffs -- obsolete inventory can happen really any time. Equipment writeoffs are, I guess, less common. They can happen. But anyway, the 6% -- the main point around this is the 6% number is within the guidance, so I guess, we'll leave the forecast to you. But you're right, there are some aspects that are not -- sorry, some cost factors in the 6% in the second quarter that don't happen every quarter.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And are you assuming similar level of fixed cost deleveraging? Or is it your anticipation that certainly, in the fourth quarter, you do have much easier comps that, that component of the negative drag actually moderates?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. Since fixed cost deleverage has a heavy component of volume in it, I'll leave that forecast to you.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, all right. And then just on MCI, so I understand some of the drivers on the year-over-year impacting the percent changes. But if I look at just the absolute level of MG&A expenses for that division, it's been running kind of $50 million for the last couple of quarters. And so on an absolute basis, is there any reason to think that, that steps up in the back half?", "David Dunnewald", "Let's see. In the second quarter, we had benefit of some reduced costs in the MCI business, in other words, timing of marketing spend and particularly comparisons versus last year. For example, in the second quarter last year, we have the joint venture and we also were spending a lot more last year in the China -- the non-joint venture part of China. And so from a JV standpoint, we will have cycled the, call it, elimination of those costs midyear this year. From the standpoint of not spending as much on some of the, call it, low-margin accounts in the rest of China, not related to the joint venture, I'm not sure exactly when in the year we cycled that, but call it roughly around midyear.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But that's a year-over-year change, though. I mean I'm just looking at the absolute level of expenses in the first half. And so is this just partly timing of the spending that gets shifted into the back half as well so the absolute spending does indeed go up in the back half?", "David Dunnewald", "I'm not going to -- well, yes, I'm not going to forecast, again, the MG&A spend in the back half in MCI. I would say that there is -- the comparisons do -- well, we do have changing comparisons in the back half versus the first half of the year, which aided the second quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tom Mullarkey from Morningstar.", "Thomas Mullarkey - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I guess I have a question to combine a couple of points made on this morning's call that was dealing with, I believe, MillerCoors. First, there was the objective that, over the next several years, the above-premium segment would go from about 9% of MillerCoors' volume to mid-teens. And then second, there was the comment that a barrel of Third Shift uses 3x the capacity of Miller Lite. Assuming that pretty much all your craft beers are probably more capacity-intensive than your Premium Lights, if you go ahead 2015, 2016, if MillerCoors, will they have enough slack capacity during the peak summer months given that Premium Light volumes will probably start rebounding and then the demand for the craft-like brews will be much stronger than as compared to now?", "David Dunnewald", "No -- yes, it's a good question. The 9% to mid-teens was something that we talked about in June in some MillerCoors meetings, which I'm sure you can listen to those on the web if you want. And then capacity utilization by brand, actually that varies quite a bit. There are actually some craft brands that, in some ways, don't use as much capacity as some of the Premium Light brands. So you're going to see a lot of variability around that. And the bottom line is we're confident that we're going to have the capacity to meet the needs of consumers for our products.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Dave, Ian Shackleton. A couple of questions. I mean, I asked Gavin a question around timing of cost savings during the year. And he made the comment, \"what's happening, we're reducing some of our guidance on COGS per hectoliter\" which seemed to imply that this is something that does become more of a factor in the second half. I just want to get some idea about that sort of $40 million to $60 million. How does that phase in during the year? Is it going to be fairly back-end loaded?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, we haven't provided granularity around the phasing of cost savings. I would say that the comments around changes in cost of goods, I'd say, the guidance around cost of goods per hectoliter is not necessarily indicative of changes in the timing of cost savings. I'd say -- if I were you, I'd go with the guidance that we gave or the goal, I guess, of $40 million to $60 million per year, the upper end of the range for the next 2 to 3 years. And that $40 million to $60 million is we expect to be able to achieve that over the next -- at least, the next 5 years.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And will you report on an annual basis what you've achieved each year? Will we get that number?", "David Dunnewald", "That's our intent, is to tell you what we've achieved at the end of each year and by the same token, to report on earnings accretion and how we're doing with the StarBev or Central Europe results and returns to shareholders.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. So you'd actually pull out the elements that relate to Central Europe and the U.K. and Central Europe merger as well?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, that's right. That's kind of one of the commitments around the acquisition so that investors could, you could say, scorecard us on that deal. And that's -- and so that's the sort of approach that we took when we gave you the numbers. Well, I would just tell you the accretion in the second quarter from Central Europe was approximately $30 million on a pretax basis. On a full year basis, it was about $55 million, and that'd be since the end of June of last year. And if you throw in the 2 weeks before that when we owned the business, it'd actually be closer. So adding 2 more weeks, which are peak season, right, it actually gets to around $70 million pretax accretion from that acquisition. That would be on an underlying basis, so you're excluding some of the deal costs and financing-related costs.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, understood. One of the things I wanted to ask about, I think Mark Hunter was talking about including in -- I think this was, in the European markets you're in, where you talked about Q1 being minus 0.5% in Q2, minus 6%. Did I understand that correctly?", "David Dunnewald", "On a -- yes, okay.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "This is right toward the back end of the call.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, 6% -- is that 6% volume we're talking about? Ian, was that 6% volume in the European segment?", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Well, my understanding was that those were market volumes for your markets in Europe, saying, it's a minus 6% for the industry in Q2 and a minus 0.5% for Q1. But I may have misunderstood that, I just wanted to check what he was actually referring to.", "David Dunnewald", "No, I appreciate the clarity. Yes, he was referring to industry trends, and he was trying to make the point that the industry really had faced a lot more challenges in the second quarter than it did in the first quarter. So that's right, those will be industry retail volume trends.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And this is U.K. and Central Europe combined? These are your markets?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, it would be. That's right, all of Europe. So in our case -- exactly, it'd be our market. So it would be the Central Europe markets plus the U.K. and Ireland. Yes, all in, that's right.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just to be clear, these are volumes, not value figures? These are volume figures?", "David Dunnewald", "Precisely, those are volume figures.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Great. One final question around Canada. Again, Stewart earlier on made some reference to shipments from Europe. And I wasn't quite sure what the reference there was. I mean, it does look -- given the STWs were weaker than STRs, but you've seen some stocking up at the end of the quarter. Is that what he was confirming?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, essentially, he was giving you some details in the process. Essentially, let's call it the difference between STWs and STRs in Canada includes some trade inventories and even some in-transit from places like Europe. So because, as you know, we run 3 of the largest import brands in Canada, we manage those brands. Now just broadly speaking, that just means that there's a bit of a difference in inventories in the quarter. And yes, we expect over time that, that should even out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "A couple of quick ones. Can you give us -- when you guys said that the International business COGS per hectoliter are expected to be down low-single digits, I assume that's, I guess, an underlying or currency-neutral number. Is that correct?", "David Dunnewald", "That particular one is in U.S. dollars partly because we have so many currencies flowing through that International business. Think about businesses in China, Mexico, India, different parts in Europe, Asia, whatever. So that one is in U.S. dollars.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay, perfect. And then there was a point on the conference call, and I don't think I caught all of it. And I think, there was a -- if I remember correctly, there was a comment that, in Canada, volumes are down 100,000 hectoliters. And was it that half of that was attributable to the year-over-year comp on Coors Light Iced T?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, that's what Stewart mentioned on the earlier call, that's right.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "But is -- so does -- I mean, if I have my numbers right, I mean, Canadian history is about 5 million hectoliters in a quarter. So that'd be -- basically, I mean, is Coors Light Iced T market share down 100 basis points year-over-year?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, I couldn't tell you what the industry is. Well, okay, around 6 million hectoliters. Remember, it's -- this is peak season, so the first quarter will be a lot lower. But I'll let you do the math, but I think you have the right numbers to work with.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. Can you tell me -- I mean, what was the peak market share for Coors Light Iced T in Canada last year?", "David Dunnewald", "Off the top of my head, I don't recall what the market share was. My sense was it was around 1% round numbers. But that's kind of a distant memory, if you will.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Jesse Reinherz from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A quick one on working capital savings. I know you guys mentioned that you had a target of $300 million from 2012 to 2014. Is that end of 2012 through 2014, so 2013 and 2014 comment? Or is it a 3-year comment?", "David Dunnewald", "It's a 3-year comment that included 2012, all of -- call it, all of 2012, if you want.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And any idea -- have you guys said anything on phasing? Or what was achieved in 2012 and thus is kind of leftover? Is it relatively even? Or...", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, we've mentioned. I don't remember if it was New York or one of the earnings calls, but it was around $70 million achieved last year in 2012.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "David Dunnewald", "Okay, great.

You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.

Swinburn", "Thank you, Jay. Hello, and welcome, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors Chief Legal and People Officer; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors VP of Investor Relations.", "On the earnings call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our third quarter 2013 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the fourth quarter.", "In the third quarter, Molson Coors increased underlying after-tax earnings nearly 8%, expanded underlying margins, grew underlying EBITDA and free cash flow, and reduced our net debt. As we anticipated on our earnings call our last quarter, consumer demand remained weak across all of our markets.", "Despite this poor consumer uptake, we have continued to invest in our core brands. Our innovation pipeline is delivering mid-single digit percent of sales and our owned above-premium brand portfolio is growing at a double-digit rate globally.", "In the third quarter, U.S. revenue per hectoliter growth was driven by positive net pricing and sales mix. Coors Light grew market share in the Premium Light segment in the quarter according to Nielsen, and our above-premium segments saw strong growth in Redd's, Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon.", "In a weak Canada market, Molson Canadian grew share in the quarter, particularly in Qu\u00e9bec. But our other core brand, Coors Light, lost volume and share. Our above-premium segment benefited from the launch of Molson Canadian Cider, Rickard's Shandy and Coors Banquet, while our Granville Island and Creemore Springs craft brands achieved strong volume growth.", "We have also decided to accelerate the termination of the joint venture which controls the Modelo brands in Canada ahead of the current expiration date of January 1, 2018. Anheuser-Busch InBev will assume control of the brands on March 1, 2014. Although there is no obligation to end the agreement early, we have reached favorable terms with ABI, resulting in compensation of CAD 17 million to Molson Coors. Additionally, our agreements to represent the Modelo brands in the U.K. and Japan have been confirmed through to the end of 2014.", "Despite weak industry demand, our Europe business grew volume nearly 1% and again increased overall market share. This was driven by positive share performance in the U.K., Croatia, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, along with continuing share trend improvement in Romania.", "Carling, our largest brand in Europe, grew both volume and share in the U.K., and above-our premium brands Coors Light, Doom Bar in the U.K., as well as Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic, all grew strongly.", "In International, we achieved Coors Light volume growth in Mexico and Latin America. Carling gained market share in Ukraine and we launched the brand in Russia in the third quarter.", "We made progress on our global cost savings and cash generation targets and paid down nearly $282 million of net debt in the quarter. We will also deliver the cost savings that Gavin announced during the June Investor Day in New York. We also continued to standardize processes to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.", "We are accelerating our commitment to reduce costs. And following last year's restructuring in Europe, a similar program has been announced in the U.S. and we are currently benchmarking our performance in Canada to ensure that we have a competitive cost base for the future.", "Now I'll turn it over to Gavin to give third quarter financial highlights and perspective on the last quarter of 2013. Gavin?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors third quarter underlying after-tax earnings increased 7.7% to $268.1 billion or $1.45 per share. This growth was driven by improved performance in the United States, Europe, International and Corporate, along with a lower effective tax rate. This lower tax rate was primarily due to changes in the geographic mix of income and onetime tax benefits in the quarter.", "Favorable foreign exchange movements and lower interest expense also contributed to improved results in the quarter.", "Underlying operating income increased 0.6%, while underlying pretax income grew 4.2% in the quarter. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 0.9% due to lower volume in Canada, the United States and International.", "In our third quarter, our U.S. GAAP after-tax income declined nearly 39%, primarily due to a $150.9 million write-down of the value of 2 brands in our Europe business. This charge was the result of our annual asset impairment testing process which drove fair value adjustments to Jelen, a mainstream brand in Serbia and to Ostravar, a regional brand in the Czech Republic. Both of these brands have recently faced increased competition, reduced market share in macroeconomic weakness in their markets which are driving the lower projected cash flows for these brands.", "Also, higher discount rates in both Serbia and Czech Republic were factors in the asset impairments as was a 50% increase in Serbian income tax rates.", "As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business. On this basis, total company net sales were unchanged from the prior year, as positive pricing and mix offset lower volume. Pricing growth across all regions and improved mix in the U.S. drove a 0.9% increase in net sales per hectoliter. Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 0.5% due to higher cost of goods sold per hectoliter in the United States.", "Total company gross margin was 41.6%, 20 basis points higher than a year ago, primarily due to gross margin growth in Europe, International and the United States. Underlying marketing, general and administrative expenses were largely in line with the prior year driven by increases in Europe that were offset by declines in the other business units. Underlying operating margin was 17.4%, up 20 basis points from a year ago driven by positive pricing and cost reductions globally.", "Our underlying earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, was $464.3 million in the third quarter, 0.6% higher than the year ago. Year-to-date, underlying EBITDA grew 5.8% to $1.15 billion.", "Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "It is important to note that our third quarter underlying result excludes some special and other non-core gains, losses and expenses that net to a $163.1 million pretax charge. In addition to the intangible asset write-downs that I described earlier, these exclusions from our U.S. GAAP results primarily relate to the net effect of unrealized foreign exchange and fair value adjustments associated with the EUR 500 million convertible note that we paid off in the third quarter, along with restructuring and integration-related costs in Canada and Europe. These special and other non-core items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "", "Underlying free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of this year totaled $746.8 million. This represents an increase of $1.8 million versus last year, driven by higher year-to-date net income. Free cash flow year-to-date this year was made up of the following factors: $1.03 [ph] billion of operating cash flow, which includes $438 million from MillerCoors; plus $37 million of net add backs, primarily related to cash paid for restructuring activities; vesting cash outflows were $218 million of capital spending; and $102 million of cash invested in MillerCoors. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.89 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $407 million, resulting in net debt of $3.48 billion, approximately $282 million lower than 3 months earlier.", "In the third quarter, we used a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper issuance to pay off maturing convertible notes of USD 575 million and EUR 500 million. We also used cash on hand and revolving credit lines to pay off a euro term loan of EUR 54 million and cross currency swaps with an out of the money liability value of $31 million.", "As recognition of our progress in strengthening our balance sheet, in September, S&P reaffirmed our credit rating of BBB- and changed our outlook to positive, up from negative previously. In upgrading its outlook, S&P said that it believed we will continue to repay debt and strengthen our credit measures over the next 1 to 2 years to levels that support a higher rate during the outlook the period.", "Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we are tightening our full year underlying effective tax rate guidance to a range of 13% to 15%, which reduces the top of the range by 2 percentage points, primarily as a result of onetime tax benefits of tax law changes in Canada. This outlook for the full year includes total onetime benefits with an underlying rate impact of approximately 4 percentage points.", "Our rate guidance range for the fourth quarter is 14% to 18%, assuming no additional taxable changes, settlements of tax ordered for adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "We continue to expect our underlying effective tax rate to move towards a range of 20% to 24% over the medium term. We're adjusting upward our cost of goods sold per hectoliter guidance for our Europe and International businesses. We now expect low single-digit increases for both these businesses for the full year in local currency. In both cases, the cost outlook changes are driven by mix shifts towards a higher cost brands, channels or geographies.", "Also, the cost of goods sold per hectoliter outlook in the United States has moved up into the mid-single digit range due to the strong growth in above-premium brands, which are higher cost.", "We are lowering our capital spending outlook from $330 million to approximately $300 million for the full year. Our full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter for the following metrics: underlying free cash flow, which is still $700 million, plus or minus 10%. However, we currently expect this to be in the upper half of that range; defined benefit pension contributions, which are expected to be approximately $50 million of expense and $150 million of cash contributions, including our 42% share of MillerCoors expense and cash; Corporate MG&A expense of approximately $105 million, excluding foreign exchange movements; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $170 million; and cost of goods sold per hectoliter outlook for our Canada business continues to be up mid-single digits in local currency.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. So in the U.S., we will continue to drive the above-premium part of our portfolio through the Redd's, Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's franchises. High-end innovations for early next year will include Miller Fortune and Smith & Forge Cider. In Premium Lights, we will have fresh advertising copy and packaging for Coors Light and we'll introduce the original Miller Lite can for a limited time.", "In Canada, we are pleased to see the return of the National Hockey League. Nonetheless, we are not seeing last year's lost volume return and we anticipate that Canada volume and profit trends in the fourth quarter will continue to face significant macroeconomic and promotional challenges. We will also be cycling substantial MG&A expense reductions, including much lower NHL sponsorship and promotion costs during the lockout last year.", "In Europe, our portfolio and innovations are achieving their best market share performances in years in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Croatia. Nonetheless, the positive summer weather in the U.K. is behind us and the region continues to be challenged by a weak economy and demand volatility, especially in Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria. While we expect difficult conditions to continue in the fourth quarter, we will remain focused on driving our core brands, above-premium and innovation. And as a result, we expect higher Europe MG&A expenses in the fourth quarter.", "Our International business continues to focus on growth driven by Coors Light, Carling, Staropramen and Blue Moon. By year end, we plan to launch our partnership with Coca-Cola Amatil and introduce some of our signature brands into the Australia market. In the fourth quarter, we expect higher international G&A expense due to the reversal of the third quarter overhead timing benefit and the Australia launch.", "And finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In the U.S., for the first 4 weeks ended October 26, STRs declined low single-digits. In Canada, our sales to retail for the first 4 weeks of the quarter increased on a low single-digit rate. In Europe, our sales volume decreased at a low single-digit rate for the first month of the quarter. And in the first 4 weeks of the quarter, our international sales volume, including royalty volume, decreased at a low double-digit rate. As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "So to summarize our discussion today, in the third quarter, we grew underlying after-tax earnings nearly 8%, expanded margins, grew underlying EBITDA and free cash flow and reduced our net debt. We continue to see weak consumer demand and shifts in consumer preferences that will impact our business for some time. In this environment, we will accelerate our commitment to transformational efforts to grow our brands and make Molson Coors more competitive and to drive total shareholder return going forward.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. My prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "So at this point, Jay, we'd like to open it for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, first, just on Canada. So I was surprised by the volume weakness in the third quarter, particularly as you're lapping some of the negative impact last year from the can shortages. So maybe just some color around what's happening both from a macro perspective and the competitive situation, whether you've seen actually even a step up in terms of the competitive activity, sequentially, in the quarter. And how are you thinking about, as you get into the fourth quarter, to your point, you've got spending comparisons that are going to be pretty easy but then you've got -- sorry, profit made [ph] From just not spending money last year, but you also have very easy volume comparison with the hockey strike. So, can you just help us in terms of volume and spending outlook in the fourth quarter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, certainly, Judy. I'll pass it on to Stewart for the detail, obviously. But the third quarter was disappointing in terms of volume. Overall weather didn't help but even so, taking all that to 1 side, it was a disappointing quarter. We tried to outline quite clearly in the script how we see things going forward and what the headwinds will be. But, Stewart, do you want to pick up on the detail?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Sure. Judy, we -- look, the fourth quarter -- I mean, sorry, the third quarter is heavily, heavily influenced by the performance of Coors Light. We didn't see the same kind of performance we saw last year. Last year was particularly strong for Coors Light, with Coors Light Iced T launched, a lot of news around the brand but we saw a lot less news in this year, that will change in the future. Relative to Q4 and our comments, there are really 3 things to note. Well, first of all, hockey is back. It's a valuable property for us and it's working well for the activation of our brands. But if you look at the overall trends year-to-date, they've been worse than what we expected. And so while we expect Q4 to be better than the year-to-date trend because of the year-over-year comps that you mentioned, the underlying market weakness will still influence the overall result. But more importantly, in Q2, we noticed -- we noted in our release that we had a significant marketing phasing benefit, now, which we expected to reverse in the back half, and you're now going to see that coming through in Q4. So that's how I put the pieces together. Your last piece of your question was what's the competitive environment look like. And the market remains very competitive. I would say that specifically from a pricing perspective, we have seen an environment with strong pressure to keep prices lower and with a more heavily promoted packaging mix.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Maybe just taking a step back, though. I think if you look at your performance in Canada, lowest market share in the third quarter that we've seen. I think, in the last several years, your margins are continuing to slide here. I guess I just wanted to get some perspective on what is really a realistic outlook for this business in the near term. Are there any other structural solutions to what you're facing in Canada? Or just any step change in terms of the cost structure? I know you're focused on getting more cost savings, but is there something beyond what you're doing already just because it just seems like we've been in a much more challenging situation than we would have thought entering the year.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes. Taking it at sort of headline level, Judy, if you look at the overall position in Canada, we've gained market share in the value segment and that's been an issue for us over quite a long period of time. We're gaining market share in above-premium segments, and we've got a very strong innovation program coming through. So we're pleased with that. The issue really has been in our core brands. And within that, Canadian has performed very well and Coors Light has been a disappointment, specifically in the quarter. Some of that is down to very difficult comps, but also there's work we need to do in investing behind the brand. We're very clear what we need to do about that. Additionally, our cost base is something that we do need to address but we're confident we will do that. And we've tried to signal in the script that we're starting work on that. That, obviously, will be a multiyear program, but we do believe there's work we can do that will help our net profit percentage, as well. So that's how we're viewing the overall business. But the overlying issue -- the overlaying issue, I'm sorry, is that the weak -- consumer demand has been weak and that has not helped us.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just, finally, Gavin. Just -- I know there's been some moving parts in terms of your free cash flow outlook. I guess I just wanted to get your latest expectation on the timing in which you get to your leverage target?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Judy, we're still on track with the program which we announced 1 year ago when we did the Starbev acquisition. We are expecting to be -- we had a target to get back to our pre-Starbev acquisition leverage ratios in the 2- to 3-year timeframe. And we're on track with it. We're pleased with the work that we're doing on working capital -- generating working capital. So we're pleased with the progress we're making against the target that I announced in New York in June. So, the short story, Judy, is we're on track with that 2- to 3-year time frame that we announced 1 year ago.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "A couple of questions also here on Canada. Firstly, the Corona comment, the Modelo comment, could you repeat that? And how much volume is going to be lost here, contribution to profits? Can you help us with some sense of the negative impact there?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I will -- I'll repeat what I said, Mark, so you've got it exactly, okay? We have decided to accelerate the termination of the joint venture, which controls the Modelo brands in Canada, ahead of the current expiration date of January 1, 2018. Anheuser-Busch InBev will assume control of the brands on March 1, 2014. Although there is no obligation to end the agreement early, we have reached favorable terms with ABI, resulting in compensation of CAD 17 million to Molson Coors. Additionally, our agreements to represent Modelo brands in the U.K. and Japan have been confirmed through the end of 2014. All the detail of this is in the Q, Mark. So you could pick it up there. But, Stewart, do you want to add any detail to that?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, sure. So Mark, on your question around volume, the Corona volume, which is not in our financial volume but which is our STM's -- in our STRs rather, is in low single digits, that's best guidance for that number. Relative to profit, if you look back at historic filings, we have had about $12 million to $15 million a year of pretax equity income coming through and then about $5 million to $7 million a year of various administrative cost recoveries. And then, there's about $3 million to $5 million of variable cost reimbursements. I think what's important to know here is that the way that the deal's been structured, we've effectively been paid for the profits that we would have received between now and the natural expiration of the contract. And so the profits, obviously, which we've come out of our P&L, will be in the bank early next year. Relative to some of the costs, some of those costs just disappear along with Modelo.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And I hate to overly technical here but I will be. The 70 -- that was a 7-0 million Canadian dollar comment in terms of compensation? I know it's going to be in the Q. But 7-0, not 1-7?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "7-0.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "That's correct.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, absolutely. [indiscernible] number, Mark.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "What's that?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "It sounds like a much better number, yes.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, exactly. And then, Stewart, the comment about $12 million to $15 million, $5 million to $7 million, and $3 million to $5 million, when you net all those numbers together, what kind of per annum pretax income has it been generating for you?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, I mean, those are the component markets I shared. The reason I explained them separately, the $12 million to $15 million is something that won't repeat. The $5 million to $7 million is cost reimbursement against some of our cost, some of which are direct and the variable costs we wouldn't continue to have. So that's why I framed them up in those 3 buckets so that you can model them. All of that comes through -- the equity income, rather, comes through in the COGS line. So you'll have to make your models adjustment to COGS to reflect that. The other ones come through in their natural expense lines.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. Okay. We can take up the rest with Dave later. Just also on Canada, 2 questions. Firstly, the cost of sales per hectoliter guide, I was surprised it didn't change for the year given the really low increase in the third quarter. Can you give us some sense of what kind of cost of sales per hectoliter increase you would expect to see in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, more strategic. We've heard rumblings that on certain packages in certain regions, you guys are being more promotional. Can you speak to where you think it's appropriate to be more promotional, either packages or regions? And where you're being -- where you intend to be more disciplined?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Stewart, I think I'll let you do both of those.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Sure, okay. Well, on the first -- sorry, Mark, the first went right out of my head.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "What cost of sales per hectoliter, fourth quarter?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. Sorry, yes. Fourth quarter, yes. So we've given you guidance for the full year as mid-single digits. And if you look at this quarter, we got 1.4%. So I get the reason for your question, but actually, if you look at the first half of the year, we had roughly a 6% cost. So, I mean, between those 3 numbers and given our guidance for the full year, I think you can sort of interpolate what the fourth quarter will look like.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Is it -- it sounds like it's fair to think it's more in the low single-digit side.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, we said it's mid-single digits for the full year. So given the year-to-date and the full year, I'm sure you can calculate what the fourth quarter is.", "So on packaging, this is just sort of finger-pointing about whose more aggressive. I think there are always promotions across the country. And at some point, somebody advertises the package. As to the specifics, I will just tell you. So I'm not going to get into who drove what because I think there's no answer to that. I can tell you that when you look across the country, the West, there's less promotional pressure in the West, pricing, in general. Although, what you're seeing in the West, you're seeing a dynamic where value is continuing to grow because of the split between value pricing and premium. The place where we're seeing most of the pressure is in Qu\u00e9bec, and there is a good deal of pricing actually across a broad range of brews in that market, you need only look at the offers that are in the market. In Ontario, we've seen less price promotion and more in case offers. So that's probably a cantor across the big markets of the country.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I think, Peter gives some bit of a feel for some of the European markets, but I wasn't quite clear what has happened there, particularly in terms of share gains. Perhaps you could just give us a little bit of an idea which of the specific European markets you gained share in Q3?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Certainly, Ian. We gained share in the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Croatia, and our market share trends in Romania include in the quarter.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "When we think about the brand -- the 2 brand write-downs from within the Starbev acquisition, the business has performed quite well since you bought it. There must be some other brands where, effectively, the value has gone up, but I presume you weren't allowed to net those off. Is that the way the accounting works there?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Well, I'm on thin ice when it comes to accounting rules. So I'll pass that over to Gavin if that's okay, Ian.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Right, Ian. You're absolutely right. I mean, we impaired Jelen and Ostravar. Jelen, for a number of reasons, the economic environment, the discount rate increased given the profile of Serbia as a country and we had a tax increase of 50%. Ostravar is our third largest brand in the Czech Republic, it's a very regional brand, operating in a troubled economic sort of area. And you're correct, some of the other brands, like Staropramen and Kamenitza and Nik\u0161icko increased in value substantially over the last year. But unfortunately, on a brand-by-brand basis from an accounting guidance point of view, you can't net between the brands. But the overarching comment I would make is that our Europe -- at our Europe business unit level, we have no impairment, which, I guess, drives you to that conclusion.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just one final thing around Europe. Just to be clear, the Corona brand in the U.K., you'll keep that through all of 2014. Is there any further compensation that will be paid when that goes?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "We have got the brand through to the end of 2014, Ian, that's what the announcement says.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And there again, I mean, can you give us -- you gave us a reasonable feel for what that meant in Canada? Can you give us a feel for what that meant -- means for the U.K. profitability?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I don't -- well, we certainly can't give you the detail about -- that's confidential. It's a relatively low amount of our U.K. overall profitability. But Mark, do you want to embellish on that?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes. I mean, we haven't been specific on that. But it's a low single-digit percent of our total profitability in the U.K.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "On the popular theme of Canada, and you brought up the idea of benchmarking. Can you just talk, if we think about, I guess, the loss of the Corona brands and I guess the cost that would be associated are still in your books as a result of that? And then, obviously, there's the upcoming trial for the Miller brand, how that all sort of all works in on, I guess, whether it's rethinking your brewery footprint or your labor force. Can you just give us some color on that side?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, I'll let Stewart give you the sort of complete detail. But as we said in the script, we are looking at our cost base across the whole piece. So that would cover both supply chain and MG&A. We've done similar projects in the U.K. recently. And also, as Tom announced some weeks ago, we're doing a similar thing in the U.S. So it's -- well, it's a path that should be trod quite well. We are still in the process of understanding exactly what that might look like in Canada, but we do know, as in the U.K., if you include supply chain, it's going to be a multiyear project. And when we're clearer about that looks like, obviously, we'll come back and give you the full detail. But, Stewart, do you want to talk about Corona and Miller to any extent?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. I'm not sure there's anything extra to offer other than maybe 2 things. First of all, on the cost reduction side, I mean, to Peter's point, we have an active project underway to consider all those options. With respect to Miller, we are continuing to support the brand and to do a good job of that. And until we hear otherwise, that's going to continue to be our brand. With respect to Corona, we've been paid for that. So I'd say all around, we feel pretty good about the direction we're going.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "And my one follow up. I mean, in Tom's cost reduction, is there any -- Dave said that a lot of that is going back into the market in terms of brand support. Can you talk generally how you feel about your level of brand support in Canada, whether the cost reductions -- you would see the drop in the bottom line? Or do you feel the need for greater level of in-market spending?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "As with our U.S. business, we feel that we would like to see a majority of any cost savings reinvested back into our business. But in all honesty, until [ph] Know exactly what that looks like, it's difficult to give you any more precision.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just another follow-up question on Canada, and forgive me if I missed this earlier. But I think it's COGS per -- or price per hectoliter in the quarter with down 0.3%. I think, in the press release, you talked a little bit of the mix shift being a drag and then pricing being up. Can you give us a little bit more color in terms of directionally, how much the mix shift dragged and what the pricing was in the quarter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Stewart, do you want to take that?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, happy to do that Bryan. If you looked at the quarter, I mean, we were pleased to see that we sold about 1.2% of positive pricing but that was offset by a 1.5% of negative mix.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And was the pricing that you took in the quarter -- I guess, how did that stack up relative to the market? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is the volume weakness and the market share weakness at all sort of related to where you are, like on price gaps or pricing? Or is that not really an issue that's been driving the market share?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "I think that pricing has been driving the market share. If I look at the places where we've lost volume, I mean, we're losing volume most mostly to the smaller brews which are playing in 2 places. One, in value, where they've been competing and pushing very hard on value. And so we've seen aggressive pricing there. And the other is on craft. And I think, on craft, we've been doing a really good job but the size of our craft portfolio relative to the rest of our total portfolio is much smaller. So we have to gain at a faster rate in order to make up the volume loss.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Peter, just as a second question. Just -- can you talk a little bit about -- you've made some changes in terms of changing the operating segments, you've made some personnel changes, so just kind of how you feel about -- just, organizationally, you feel like you're set at this point and in terms of how the organization has sort of adapted or adjusted to those changes. And also just in relation to -- especially the Canadian market being difficult, but just in general, it's been a tough operating environment, and just kind of how you feel about kind of where the organization stands at this point relative to some of the changes you've made.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Well, I mean, obviously, the biggest change that we've had to accommodate, Bryan, has been the inclusion of the Central European business, and the combination of that with the U.K. And as we said in previous calls, the integration of that has gone exceptionally well. We made the call to integrate the whole of Europe earlier than we would otherwise have chosen to do because the integration have gone so well. So we're very pleased with that. It's still work that's ongoing. But we're establishing a very firm platform across Central Europe. Part of what we can and can't do, from an organizational point of view, does rely on the comment I made in the script about our ability to standardize our operations. And so, we do really need to get all of our platforms -- sorry, the organization on one platform so that we have the flexibility to decide what we want to do organizationally. So I think that's job one, we're well on track for that. We're probably not going to complete it until the middle of 2015 but we'll -- we can make decisions in advance.", "Generally, above and beyond that, to be honest with you, the view that I take on an organizational structure is it's a constantly moving feast and you always have to review it, make sure it's fit for purpose and also reflects what the requirements of the external world are. And at the moment, as we said, the external world in our market's not necessarily doing it any favors. So we constantly have to look at how we can make sure our organization structure is as efficient and as lean as possible.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. A couple of questions. On the Corona Canada situation, is there any anti-trust review there? And if so, has that been completed? And could there be any other sort of outcomes because of that?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "We don't anticipate any anti-trust issues at all.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. Second, what would be your best estimate today of your capacity utilization in Canada and how the footprint looks? Any plans to change that, and any possibilities on your side in terms of making, perhaps, some acquisitions in Canada that could perhaps improve your utilization, if it's running too low.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. And I'll let Stewart pick up on some of the detail. But just a couple of overall comments, and I'll certainly take the last one. I think we've said that we really are focused on paying down our debt over the near to medium term. But equally, should an attractive brand proposition come up, then we would certainly consider it. There's nothing in our sights at the moment, but we're always open to that in terms of improving our overall portfolio. The other comment I'd make is we can talk about overall capacity in Canada, but this is a very large country. And what really matters is it's the capacity by province and utilization by province. And, obviously, when we look at the overall cost structure of the business, that's something that we're going to take into account going forward, our total brewery footprint. Stewart, is there anything else you want to add?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. Look, we don't actually share the specifics of our capacity utilization, Robert. But suffice to say that we have -- we do have some excess capacity and that is forming part of our plan to understand how to reduce our overall costs. As Peter said, when you look at your supply base and your supply -- well, the footprint, that is -- that does end up being a multiyear project. We fully expect it. But there are opportunities to take advantage of that.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, I guess, what I heard from the prior comment though is just because of the size of the country and the cost of shipping beer, it's tough to take plants out because, I guess, the increased cost of distribution would -- may, perhaps, offset some benefits on the manufacturing side. Did I hear that right?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I don't think so.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "I think what you're... Go ahead.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I think what I was trying to say was that it's really of little value to give you an overall capacity figure for the whole of Canada, that you have to look at the capacity of breweries within provinces and then you make decisions about those specific breweries within those provinces.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to go back to Canadian volume for a minute. The commentary was helpful but it certainly seems like a pretty pronounced change on the volume front. So, can you give us a sense how much of the volume weakness is more the competitive environment versus other issues like marketing effectiveness, brand equity in general, and then the strategies you're implementing to try to improve trends going forward, and when you think we might see some more traction around that.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Well, the -- certainly, the pressure, as we've -- I think we've said already on the call, really came in our core brands and specifically in Coors Light. But Stewart, do you want to repeat or go over anything you said before?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, I mean, first of all, I don't think we've seen a dramatic inflection. I think this -- we've seen some pressure in this market over a number of years and we're working to change that. So what are the things that are changing? Well, first we've seen a dramatic improvement in the performance of Canadian and we're very pleased about that. We've now started to gain share in value and we're pleased about that. We're gaining share in above premium as we press harder with our brands there. As I mentioned, we under-indexed this so we have to accelerate growth even further to replace lost volume in premium. And on the import side, we've had flat share. So the issue comes back to Coors Light and a couple of the tail brands. I mean, we've got -- we have a clear understanding of what the drivers are, there is some promotional mechanics that we'll need to be prepared to answer there. But against the brand itself, we need more news. Now, we'll expect to see that with more promotion around the vented can. We're already seeing a lot of excitement and strong performance from the rollout of Coors Banquet, and I expect that to continue next year and that will help the overall trademark. So I suppose I'm in a place that is fairly positive in terms of understanding what the drivers are and having a plan to address that on an ongoing basis.", "Dara W. Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And is marketing a significant piece? Are you trying to address that going forward? Would you expect a significant marketing increase or does it depend on [indiscernible]", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. I mean, I think, so to Peter's point, we do expect to invest savings back into the company. Having said that, we'll take that on a brand-by-brand basis. What I do think is that if I look at the current copy of Coors Light, it's done a good job of sort of bringing to life cold. It perhaps hasn't done as good a job around refreshment. And I think you'll see us address that in our new copy next year.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Thank you, Jay, and thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning/afternoon, wherever you are in the world. We look forward to speaking to you again when we announce our fourth quarter results. Thank you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Hello, everybody, and welcome. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our third quarter 2013 follow-up earnings conference call.", "Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our regular earnings conference call with Peter Swinburn, Gavin Hattersley and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.", "So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on this call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Manager; Spencer Schurr, Finance Forecasting Manager; Katie Walter, Senior Forecasting Analyst; Erik Mickelson, Manager of Technical Accounting; Ashley Walker, Manager of SEC reporting; Brian Tabolt, Senior Director of Technical and SEC accounting; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax.", "As Peter Swinburn mentioned on our regular earnings call earlier today, in the third quarter, Molson Coors increased underlying after-tax earnings nearly 8%, expanded gross margins and underlying pretax margins and grew underlying EBITDA and free cash flow. As we anticipated on our earnings call last quarter, consumer demand was weak across our markets. Despite this, we have continued to invest in our core brands.", "Our innovation pipeline is delivering a mid-single-digit percent of sales and our owned above-premium brand portfolio is growing at a double-digit rate globally. We also made progress on our global cost savings and cash generation targets, paid down nearly $282 million worth of net debt in the quarter and continue to standardize processes to reduce complexity and improve efficiency.", "Across our markets, we continue to see weak consumer demand and shifts in consumer preferences that will impact our business for some time. In that environment, however, we will accelerate our commitment to transformational efforts to grow our brands and make Molson Coors more competitive and to drive total shareholder return going forward.", "So with that, we'd now like to open it up for your questions. Back over to you, Tracy.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Dave, a couple of questions relating to Canada, trying to better understand the Modelo change there. And just looking through the Q, it sounds like you add those numbers that Stewart was referencing. In other words, the Q talks about a year-to-date number of $9 million in equity income and then a year-to-date number of, I believe, if I'm this reading this right here, $9 million in reimbursement for some costs. Is that the right way to think about what's going away? Obviously, we don't what the future number would be, but in terms of what the run rate numbers have been, is that right way to think about that?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, I think that's a good start, especially from a year-to-date basis. I think for your -- from your perspective, it's also useful to know that on an annualized basis, say, in recent years, the equity income from those brands in Canada has been in the range of $12 million to $15 million pretax per year, which flows through the cost of goods line. And then we had $5 million to $7 million worth of, what we call, administrative fee reimbursements, and those hit the MG&A line. And then in addition, we have some variable costs of $3 million to $5 million that have been reimbursed. Now those variable costs go away. So when the brands go away, those costs go away with the brand. But the other elements, the first 2 that I mentioned, that's equity income that we won't get. In a sense, we're getting paid for that through the $70 million payment from ABI for [indiscernible]", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got it, got it, got it. So it's really those 2 -- those first 2 items that Stewart mentioned that are more of the go-forward loss?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, if you're looking for, call it, impact in the absence of any changes in the business, in other words, any additional brands we might drag through the business, through innovation or what have you, then yes. In other words, static steady state, that's the -- that's what the impact has been in recent years with those brands.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. Okay. And then kind of in that same vein, could you remind us where you stand in Canada with this lawsuit relating to the Miller brand?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, right now, there is no significant update, I guess. At this point, we have a temporary injunction, so that we continue to manage the brands. We think we're doing -- well, we're working hard to manage those brands in a way that's right for them in Canada. And at the same time, we have a court date in December.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "December, got it. And what's the -- do you have a rough market share figures for the Modelo portfolio and the brands that are subject to this suit in the case of SABMiller?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, the -- okay. Those are -- yes, the Modelo brands are low single-digit percent of our portfolio in Canada as a percent of our STRs. And then the Miller brands, same thing, low single-digit percent.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "So on a market share basis, also low single-digit?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. So lower single-digit. 39% market share in Canada.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Great. And that's kind of my more business question. What do you think -- so next year, you're going to be competing, call it, 3 points lower than 39% because of the Modelo impact. And Labatt will be competing kind of 3 points higher. I think their shares is around 40%, 41%. What do you think that kind of end market, marketplace effect will be? Obviously, you have, of course, Banqueting introduced. But in terms of just getting the shelf space and being able to compete for attention at the shelf, how do you think that will affect you?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. In essence, in Canada, if you sort of stack up all the brands we have from top of the category to the bottom of the category, we believe we still have a very strong portfolio in Canada and we are working on an ongoing basis to enhance that portfolio. And we have evidence that with recent moves in that marketplace, we now have the largest-selling cider in the market. We, obviously, have the largest beer of any -- largest beer in the marketplace in Coors Light. Molson Canadian is doing well. We have strengthened our sub-premium or value offerings in that market. And so we feel good about the portfolio we have and we're just going to continue to drive it forward. You're right, though, this does have a share impact but it's relatively modest, at least in absolute numbers.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "That's great. That's very helpful. And finally, Coors Banquet. I think you have MillerCoors release at seventh consecutive years of growth in the U.S. Just trying to get some sense of dimension, potential of that brand in Canada, how you guys are thinking about? Obviously, it's new there. But can you give us anything to think about how you're thinking about its potential there?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, not a lot of specifics, but I would say right. Banquet has 7 years of growth in a declining segment in the U.S. And really has had done nicely in the face of not only that, but some very tough macroeconomic times. In Canada, there's a lot of spillover in brands, messaging -- anyway, a lot of spillover across border between -- when you have brands between the U.S. and Canada. It works both ways. And so we're really excited about the opportunity for Banquet in Canada because, obviously, it's doing well in the U.S. and has a long heritage. And we think that will ring true with a lot of Canadian beer drinkers.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Do you know offhand portion of mix or market share in the U.S.?", "David Dunnewald", "No, the easy answer is low single-digits. But I mean, really low. It's a relatively small brand. We just figured Coors Light's essentially high single-digits and Banquet would be, yes, low single-digits.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes, Dave. I have a couple of areas I wanted to follow up on. First, there was quite a bit of talk around further cost-cutting moves in Canada. And if I wrote it down properly, there was some talk about completing the efficiency structure by mid-2015. And I wonder if I just got that right. And I guess, what I'm really trying to get as well here, is this all part of the programs announced in Investor Day in the summer? Or are we actually thinking about further programs on top of what was envisioned in that stage?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, this program is envisioned in the $40 million to $60 million of cost savings that were -- that we committed to in June or talked about in June. And as you may recall, we said it -- actually Gavin -- Gavin actually said it. At the high end of that range, for the next 2 to 3 years and the $40 million to $60 million overall for at least 5 years. So -- but really, the main point is we're looking at ways to make sure that our cost structure is competitive on an ongoing basis. So this isn't necessarily the end of the line on bad cost savings even within that $40 million to $60 million that we talked about.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And so the importance of the mid-2015 date, did I get that down correctly or...", "David Dunnewald", "Sorry. Yes, you heard it exactly right. That's what Stewart said. And the reason is any time you have, what I would call, a broad-based benchmarking type of exercise in a business, then some changes can be done relatively quickly and some take quite a bit longer.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Right. But was that particularly talking about the production infrastructure or is that the cost of the whole business?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, he said ramp up mid-2015, he was really talking about the overall effort that he was referring to. In other words, across supply chain and G&A and so on. I would tell you, though, that generally speaking, the supply chain takes more time because you're dealing with processes in breweries and just figuring out how do we make things more efficient.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Understood. The second thing that I just wanted to talk about was, I think Gavin mentioned earlier on not quite a lot of debt repayments. And I'm just wondering what we should be thinking about for the average coupon for next year, really, for FY '14?", "David Dunnewald", "Okay, let's see. There are 2 ways you could attack that. One would be just to look at the debt that we have outstanding in the 10-Q, and you can sort of tone up a coupon from that, which will get you -- it sounds pretty close to me. The other way to think about it is now that the -- I guess, piece of perspective I'd add is now that our convertible debt is substantially all paid off, then the cash coupon looks an awful lot like the booth coupon. So that will make the math a little easier.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. But if we pick up the Q, that should give us really all the pieces that we need there?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, it's all right in there. Brian may even have a page number for you. Give him a second.", "Brian D. Goldner", "Page 26, footnote 12.", "David Dunnewald", "Here you go. He's not familiar with that document, is he?", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Dave, so first, just on Canada. So the gap between the sales volume and STR of about 2 points, I think you called out some inventory de-stocking. Can you just give us a little bit of color on what happened in the quarter? Is this something that will be ongoing? Or does this reverse next quarter?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, good question. No, actually, what happened was when we rolled into second quarter this year, we wanted to make sure that we had a little bit more robust inventories in some particular channels on certain particular brands this year versus what we had last year. So we ended the second quarter this year with a bit higher inventories and trade, so to speak. And that's wholesalers; in some cases, retailers; in some cases, in-transit; then, in other cases, actually governmental entities when you're talking about Canada. So we wanted a bit more inventory in the second quarter leading into peak season. We accomplished that, so we ended the second quarter with a bit higher inventories in those channels, so to speak. And then we, essentially, they brought them back down by the end of the third quarter. So at the end of the third quarter this year, on a year-to-date basis, we're essentially in line with the prior year.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. Okay. And then just on the volume performance in Canada, I think you had given some of the brand numbers, but I don't know if you've actually quantified how much Molson Canadian was up and Coors Light was down and others. So could you help us just kind of go through your key brands and the volume performance in the quarter in Canada?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, sure, I can give you a few headlines on that. It's, at least, somewhat general. Let's see, Spencer's got -- yes, we said that Molson Canadian performed relatively well, actually picked up some share in the quarter. So the market was down about 1% and Canadian was down less than the market. The Coors Light was down at a, call it, a high single-digit rate. And let's see, what other ones do you care about? Obviously, Coors Banquet was up strongly on a 0 base from the year before, which is particularly meaningful. But Keystone Light is a relatively important brand and that one grew at a double-digit rate. As you may know the value segment in Canada is a growth segment unlike in the U.S. And then the other important brands, we've got the Carling brand up in Canada, and that one declined slightly. Our Craft brands, importantly, at the top end of the category, such as Rickard's and Creemore and Granville Island, all grew at healthy rates and gained share. Does that give you a heads start?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, yes, that's helpful. So just on Coors Light high single-digit decline, how much of that was the Iced T portion and -- versus kind of the underlying Coors Light?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, Iced T was a factor. It still would've -- that brand still would have been down at least mid-single digits without Coors Light Iced T.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Okay. So the point there is you had sort of the benefit of the Iced T last year. On top of that, you probably had more activation on the underlying Coors Light, given the Iced T launch and other activities that you had implemented last year. So kind of lapping that, made the Coors Light a little bit more challenging?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, I would say, that's exactly right. We had some challenging comps around Coors Light, not only related to Iced T, but also related to weather. And I would say this year, we had fewer impact promotions than some of our competitors. And when you have the biggest brand in the market, that can have a greater impact than if you're a smaller brand. So these are things that, along with new ad copy and so forth, that Stewart talked about this morning, that we're working on around our largest brand in Canada.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And when you look at the October trends, Canada, up low single-digits in STR, are you seeing some moderation in terms of the decline in Coors Light in that context?", "David Dunnewald", "I would say that we are seeing -- and I'm not going to drill into October, STRs for Coors Light. But, let's say, more broadly in October, you do have the return of hockey, which is a good thing. You also -- but then as Stewart mentioned earlier, this morning, that we're still going against a really relatively tough macroeconomic environment and, call it, weak consumer confidence and some promotional challenges in the Canadian market. So those things continue and it is nice to pick up hockey, but you can't lose sight of those other pieces as well.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, okay. And then on the COGS line for Canada, so just the sequential moderation, I guess, we had always expected the back half to be a little bit more favorable. But it just seems like the drop in the third quarter versus the first half was a bit more dramatic, so -- and especially, given that volume was also negative, so you're still kind of suffering from the fixed cost de-leveraging. Anything to call out there? Was there any timing benefit? Or anything that kind of helped your third quarter COGS per unit in Canada more?", "David Dunnewald", "In -- sorry, in the third quarter?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "In the third quarter, yes.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. No, nothing comes to mind. Let's see, now I would say that there's very little hockey benefit that we would pick up in Canada. The increase in MG&A expense actually is more of a challenge in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, a little bit more of a COGS comment. Your COGS were, in Canada, up in 1 -- was it 1.5% or so in the third quarter and it's been running 6%, 6.5% in the first half?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. So we did have a bit more cost reductions in the third quarter, but they can have a little bit of ebb and flow there. But I don't think that -- I wouldn't call that a major factor. No, I don't think there was anything in particular that comes to mind but -- and I mean, yes, we had normal sort of -- I mean, think about the cost of goods line in a business that size made up of thousands of different lines and entries that build up to the final COGS line. We've seen some favorability on some pieces of input inflation line, if you will. But I wouldn't call out a major driver and as I say, there's just a bit of an ebb and flow to that type of line within that kind of range is not uncommon.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, right. Okay, got it.", "David Dunnewald", "Our guidance is maintained for the year, right?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. But you have a wide range in terms of mid-single digits, particularly?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, correct.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms of the free cash flow. So the first, just the CapEx by coming down by, I think, $30 million or so. Can you talk about what's driving the decline? Is it more timing? Or are you just deciding that some of the projects are not worth spending in this year?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, every year, we like to be very tight on capital. And so that's not new. But I would say if anything, we're raising the bar on that with the pack model that Gavin has talked about that we're pushing through the organization. And I would -- it's all about returns on capital.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the free cash flow guidance coming up towards the upper end of that $700 million plus/minus 10%, is it mostly just CapEx?", "David Dunnewald", "Mostly CapEx. Well, that would be one factor. But really, our free cash flow is built on a lot of different things and including working capital, obviously, financial performance and so it's not just CapEx.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you remind me how much you have left in the cross-currency swap settlement?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, we'll see if Brian or Spencer can come up with a specific number. But we -- my recollection is we have -- well, I don't have to recall, Brian is finding it.", "Brian D. Goldner", "Yes, at the -- as noted in the 10-Q, we have $134 million outstanding as of the end of September. However, we settled an additional amount early in the fourth quarter of an additional $51.4 million.", "David Dunnewald", "Well, does that leave us with a net out of the money of about $80 million then?", "Brian D. Goldner", "Approximately, it does move with...", "David Dunnewald", "That's cool. It will move with FX and other column adjustments. But that's been -- well, primarily FX. But around $80 million left, Judy, at current FX rates. I should say end of quarter FX rates, shouldn't I?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And is the plan just to settle all of that this year or some of that gets spilled over into 2014?", "David Dunnewald", "We'll see. It's due in 2014, but as you can tell because actually, the stuff that we just settled was due in 2014. We make decisions on -- in that area kind of an ongoing basis depending on how much cash generation we have and what the pros and cons are from an organizational stand or I shouldn't say organization -- from a shareholder value standpoint. In other words, what makes the most sense.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Dave, a couple of questions. I guess, the first one, if you look at the MillerCoors JV, I think the savings, cost savings identified in the quarter was $33 million and I know we were modeling something more like $25 million. And so was there any benefit at all from the headcount reduction that was just recently announced? Or was there any other sort of unusual thing that occurred in the quarter just to cause that to be as high as it was?", "David Dunnewald", "The short answer is no, not related to the announcement. That announcement was certainly not implemented before the end of the quarter. But as with some of the other things we've discussed about cost of goods, for example, there can be a bit of an ebb and flow to cost savings as well when they come in, so to speak. So we had a lot of supply chain savings in MillerCoors in the third quarter, but also some logistics, some productivity, brewing process. I mean, it's the usual types of savings but just the mixture and magnitude was a bit different in the third quarter.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just say on MillerCoors again, the price mix was helped a lot by mix, and that's a function of some of the new products. And it sounds -- I guess, just trying to get a sense because the cost per COGS, per hectoliter is also up. So I'm just -- as we try to model out just how to think about how a higher mix of those products like Redd's, for instance, affect the P&L, it's -- is it somewhat neutral in terms of what happens on the gross profit line, meaning there are higher revenue per unit, but not necessarily a higher gross margin per unit?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, let's see. So you're thinking about it in the right way. NSR per hectoliter, net sales revenue per hectoliter, is higher on brands like Redd's. And the cost of goods are higher as well, generally speaking, on the above-premium brands. But these are good margin brands. I mean, I'm not going to be too specific. But if we have above-premium brands, unless it's a situation where we're giving the lion's share of the profit stream to the brand owner and we've seen that in, for example, in the Modelo brands in some markets and that sort of thing, then above premium generally means healthy margins.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, so -- because I was -- so it's -- theoretically, they would be higher gross margin. And then, the comments that, I guess, Tom made on the call about there being the payback period being or the breakeven period, maybe being some on these new ones 3 years is more just a function of what's being spent on marketing and SG&A as opposed to there being a real gross margin differential?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, I think -- yes, Tom's comments, I think, are right. They go largely toward -- talk about the or essentially towards the flow of the MG&A investment in the brands. The gross margins don't change significantly as you move through the introduction. But I think again, you're thinking about it the right day. Above-premium brands tend to have more robust gross margins than value brands, for example. Sometimes, you have scale differences that you need to take into account. But for the same-sized brand, that generally holds true. I would add -- there's one other thing I'd add. Some other -- so we talk about innovations and how we're spending more behind them. It's also throw into the mix packaging innovations can add cost and generally also revenue. So that's another, call it, mixed components. But not, I would say, not as important as the new brands like Redd's and the Third Shift that we've talked about previously.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess, just following back on Ian Shackleton's question earlier, I was just trying to think about the shape of net interest expense next year, I guess I've got 2 components that are going to affect it, right? It looks like from -- I inferred from what you said earlier and although I admit I haven't looked at Page 26 in the Q yet, is that interest -- did the interest rate, the coupon rate is going to be lower next year and then the other thing I'm factoring in is some -- if you're sort of targeting what your leverage ratios are going to be by the end of next year, you're going to have some debt reduction as well. So I should have some leverage, positive leverage on the net interest line next year just based on those 2 components, is that right?", "David Dunnewald", "Debt pay down? Yes, that is priority cash use. So I'll let you decide how you want to actually model that out, but that makes a lot of sense. When you say the coupon's lower, actually, I'm not sure I -- I mean, depends on how you define coupon. If you really mean the average percent...", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It's the average rate, yes, you'd pay on your debt.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, actually the debt that we'd paid off, well, this year it was a mixture. On a book basis, the $575 million convertible was actually somewhat on the high side for coupon. Obviously, it was paid off end of July. And then the -- however, the 0 coupon euro convertible on a book basis, that was extremely low coupon. I think you might actually be more successful modeling it out, just take the debt outstanding, go to the Page 29 or 26 that Brian mentioned and then you can get kind of an average coupon for an amount of debt. And then at the same time, think about what you think we might be able to accomplish as far as debt paydown goes. That will get you closer. But having said all that stuff about the coupon, I mean, yes, we have less debt outstanding. So lower total interest expense, we'll see what rates do a some of the debt that is outstanding, revolvers or what have you. But I'd say you'd got to be able to get an estimate off of that.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Okay. And then just on the tax rate, so can you just -- so now we've got this sort of hypothetical factor in the future where the tax rate would go back up, migrate back up to kind of more normal tax rate, but we're not really sure where that is in the future. You may be, but we don't. So I'm just trying to understand. I mean, from this year's sort of tax rate coming in kind of lower than what was originally thought, if I understood everything that was said, it's largely a function of some changes in statutory rates in Canada and some other -- those types of things and not necessarily settlements that happen to come up and take your tax rate down. So a, is that true? And then b, just as we think about the ramp to a more normal tax rate, how much is left still that of tax matters that are unsettled that have to be settled? And as we start to think about modeling the tax rate next year and over the next couple of years, how steep do you think that curve is? Or is that -- did the slope of that curve change at all?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, okay. So in Canada, it was actually tax law changes. The rates didn't actually change. We've got some FIN 48 roll-offs that also had an effect. But that's just detail. What I would want to know if I were you, okay 13% to 15% tax rate for the year, about 4 percentage points of benefit from onetime tax stuff, including the things I just mentioned. So that gets you to more of, call it, a normalized rate, if you will. And then we said that we expect to move toward that 20% to 24% long-term tax rate over the next few years, which I define that as 3 to 5 years. That stuff could change. So obviously, all that is caveated by assuming no changes in tax laws and those types of things.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It just feels like it's been 3 to 5 years for the last 10. So I'm just trying to understand if we're closer to the...", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, and that's a fair question. And of course, the reason is we've actually seen corporate income tax rates coming down around the world. Except, of course, in the U.S. That's been really significant in Canada, the U.K. We've added the Central Europe business that has relatively low tax rates, average of 10% to 20%, depending on which country you're in. So I'd say if you put that all that together, you're right, it's -- that progression has been delayed for those reasons.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one last question. Just related to the asset write-downs in StarBev. Is there a -- so if you've changed the cash flow expectations for those brands, does it change the cash flow expectations in total for what you thought StarBev in aggregate was going to generate?", "David Dunnewald", "So yes, the value of the brands are lower, the way that they are valued is discount of cash flows. I guess, the best answer is we reiterated our guidance that we expect to be driving, what we call, shareholder value or ROIC over WACC in the 3- to 5-year time frame. And I would also emphasize that the while those 2 brands warrant that they're write-down based on impairment testing and DCF valuations and those types of things, we had other, really, substantial brands that actually grew in value. And Gavin mentioned earlier today, Staropramen and Nik\u0161icko and some others in that market. And the overall Europe segment valuation is certainly above carrying value.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then do those -- does the write-down at all affect, I guess, what your ongoing depreciation and amortization would be? And also does it have any effect on your tax rate, like is there a loss or some other benefit that you'd get at some point down the road because of that as a credit, I should say?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. So the -- let's see. Yes, the brand in Czech Republic, that one actually is moving to a definite live, Ostravar, a definite live depreciation schedule. But that does not have a significant impact on our overall depreciation, call it, flow, if you will. So I'd say, in that case, not particularly. I don't think I want to front-run the tax folks on what the implications are for tax around the brand write-downs, but if we have anything significant there, we'll update you at the right time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Pat Palozzi with Beutel Goodman.", "Pat Palozzi", "Dave, questions for you just with respect to Canada again. I just want to get a better handle on the volume and the mix. So if you look at it over the last few years, has the volume decline been larger in bottles versus cans? And has that been one of the negative factors when you call out mix?", "David Dunnewald", "Generally speaking, absolutely. The volume challenges do lean much more toward bottles, especially in the East. And that does create a cost challenge because you have to continually adjust your cost structure around returnable bottles. Saying that that's a driver, a specific driver of mix in any given period, I'd say it doesn't pop up that way. But over a longer period of time, it is a mix challenge for us. Now if you mean on the -- now, I'm talking specifically about the cost of goods line there.", "Pat Palozzi", "Yes, yes. Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to get at, that's right.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, if you're talking about revenue then that's a different question, and I'd say kind of minimal impact.", "Pat Palozzi", "So then that's been one of the challenges with you not being able to lower your COGS faster or control your costs better?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, it's one of many challenges, along with input inflation and pension costs and all kinds of other things, fixed-cost deleverage, yes. So it's one challenge.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jesse Reinherz with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Dave, a quick one for you on marketing spend. Just trying to get a sense of the size in the uptick. First in Canada, I know you guys after the second quarter had talked to a $12 million benefit from the timing of marketing. And I'm trying to figure out, it looks like this, obviously, hasn't been recorded in the third quarter. Is there anything you can kind of give us on what size of an uptick we should be looking for in the fourth quarter?", "David Dunnewald", "Well, yes -- no. Very good -- very observant of view. We did say that in the second quarter. And that is correct, we did not see a significant uptick in the third quarter. And so yes, it's primarily -- it's, how do you say, largely to be resolved in the fourth quarter.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Got you. So all of that $12 million is going to be the fourth. And then is there -- I mean, can we assume, obviously, it was down again in the third. Is there -- do you think it will be in addition to $12 million? Or should we view that as kind of the run rate, I guess?", "David Dunnewald", "I would say we had a benefit in the second quarter and we anticipate that, that benefit will largely reverse in the fourth quarter. So I don't think I'll isolate on the third quarter for you. And I'd reiterate that that's partially driven by NHL, activation and related stuff, related expense.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then quickly on Europe, you guys said on the call that you're expecting a higher MG&A in the fourth quarter. Is that relative to the third quarter? Is that relative to the year? I mean, obviously, you guys are up mid-teens in the third quarter, so are we supposed to expect an uptick beyond that?", "David Dunnewald", "Right. I didn't say specifically how much, so I'm not going to narrow it down much. But the statement was that we expect higher Europe MG&A expense in the fourth quarter. That sounds like a percentage increase year-over-year in local currency.", "Jesse Reinherz - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So year-over-year. Okay. Great, that's helpful.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Rob Ottenstein with ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Dave, a couple of follow-up questions to some of the prior questions. In terms of the brands where you had the write-downs, roughly what percentage of your volumes did they represent in Serbia and Czech Republic?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. So I'm not going to break it out by country. But the Ostravar brand in Czech, it's our third largest brand in the Czech Republic. And as you may know, we have somewhere in the teens share, between 10% and 20% share in that marketplace. So as you can tell, the third largest brand is not all that big. Staropramen is a decent sized brand in Czech Republic, but not Ostravar. Yellen is our largest brand in Serbia, so it is a significant brand in that market. And so, let's see, so I would say of the total Europe segment, we'd be in the mid-single-digit range for those 2 brands as a percent of Europe. So obviously, globally, it'd be much lower than that.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And would it be fair to say that the brand in Serbia was more of an issue with Serbia, whereas the one in the Czech Republic was more competitive?", "David Dunnewald", "Actually, I'd flip that around. The Czech brand, the issue was really local economics. The region where Ostravar is strong in the Czech Republic, they've had a number of factory shutdown, the economy there. If you think the eurozone has got challenges, the region where Ostravar sells is -- has really had a tough stretch economically. And so the consumer base is particularly suffering there. We're not suffering disproportionately in that market. It's just that particular region of the Czech Republic. The Yellen brand is a combination of eurozone challenges, Serbian economy, consumer confidence, some extra competitive activity, including at the value end of the category. So it's really a range of things in Serbia. And also, the -- which by the way, are reflected in the discount rates that we mentioned on the earlier call, as well as having a higher income tax rate, the 50% increase in Serbia this year, that's been a little tough on consumers, too. So I'd say Yellen is a combination of macroeconomics, market challenges and, call it, some competitive activity as well.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I guess, it was just kind of news to me that you'd write down the value of brands based on local economics rather than brand health considerations, so that's interesting.", "David Dunnewald", "Sorry, when we look at brand impairments, we have to look at a variety of factors. And one thing that goes into the discounted cash flows that are the primary driver of brand valuations is what's going on in the economy, what do we think sales will look like over a longer period of time or I should say a very long period of time. And the economy is part of that calculation.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, well, obviously, a lot of forecasting there.", "David Dunnewald", "It's fun stuff. One note, Bryan mentioned if you want details on those asset impairments, you can look at Page 23, footnote 11 in the 10-Q.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "All right. In terms of the $70 million you're getting for Corona in Canada, is that a pretax or after-tax amount? And any sense of how that gets taxed? And will that be used to pay down debt? Or to be reinvested in the market?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, it's $70 million is the pretax number, call it, payment for the acceleration of the contract. We accelerated it 3 years and 10 months is the agreement. How that will be used, I guess the short answer is we're going to use it in -- along with all of our other cash uses, we're just going to look for the highest return for our shareholders.", "Operator", "Since there are no further questions at this time, I turn the call back over to Mr. Dunnewald.", "David Dunnewald", "Great. Thanks, Tracy. I wanted to thank everybody for joining us on the call today.

Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to it in its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.", "The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measurements that may be discussed during the call and, from time-to-time, by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.

I really appreciate it. Hello, and welcome, everybody. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2013 follow-up earnings conference call.", "Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our regular earnings conference call, with Peter Swinburn and Gavin Hattersley and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.", "So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on the call. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Manager; Spencer Schurr, Finance Forecasting Manager; Katie Walter, Senior Analyst of Forecasting; Jason Charpentier, Treasury Director; Brian Tabolt, Senior Director of Technical Accounting and SEC Reporting; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax.", "As Peter Swinburn mentioned at our regular earnings call earlier today, in the fourth quarter, Molson Coors increased underlying pretax earnings 6.5%, expanded pretax margins and generated substantial underlying EBITDA and free cash flow. Underlying after-tax income declined less than 1% due to a higher tax rate in the quarter.", "For full year 2013, we grew underlying after-tax earnings and EBITDA and exceeded our targets for cost savings, cash generation and debt reduction. The funded status of our pension plans improved by $448 million, including our portion of MillerCoors, and we paid down $114 million of cross-currency net liabilities.", "Regionally, our U.S. business improved results, especially late in the year; Europe performed well in a difficult environment; Canada struggled; and international made significant progress toward its goal of profitability in 2016. Particular challenges included Miller Lite in the U.S. and Coors Light in Canada, along with commercial performance in Serbia. Nonetheless, our focus on building our core brands, growing the above-premium segment of our portfolio and driving sales revenue from innovation, delivered significantly improved results this year.", "Our overall brand performance was strong and, strategically, we are gaining momentum into areas that will have the most impact on our financial results as markets begin to improve.", "Also in recognition of the substantial progress that we have made in paying down our debt, our board has authorized an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.32 per share to $0.37 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2014. This 16% increase results in an annual dividend amount of $1.48 per share, which represents the payout ratio of 18.4% of 2013 underlying EBITDA.", "Equally important, our company is adopting, for the first time, a dividend payout ratio target of 18% to 22% of trailing underlying EBITDA, which we anticipate will keep our dividend in a competitive range for global beer companies for the foreseeable future.", "Now before we start the Q&A, I'd like to offer a little bit of additional perspective on one topic that Gavin Hattersley mentioned on the earlier call, and that is sales-curve accounting. As you know, this change will be applied retrospectively to our 2013 results, but it will not affect the full year results. Instead, it will change the phasing of quarterly MG&A expense within the year in most of our business units. So to give you a start in modeling the effect of this change in our 2013 results, here are the changes in MG&A expense that we expect by quarter and by unit, these are the changes relative to what we reported through last year.", "Looking at the first quarter. We expect MG&A expense to increase $9 million approximately on a consolidated basis. This is made up of an $8 million increase in Canada and a $2 million increase in Europe and a $1 million decrease in MG&A expense in the International group.", "In the second quarter, we expect approximately $15 million increase in MG&A on a consolidated basis. And this is made up of, in Canada, a $9 million increase; in Europe, a $6 million increase; in International, a $1 million increase; and no significant impact in other areas.", "In the third quarter, we expect approximately a $17 million reduction in MG&A expense. And this is made up of a $15 million -- and that's consolidated. And we expect approximately $15 million reduction in Canada; $2 million reduction in Europe; and no significant effect in other areas.", "And then finally, in the fourth quarter, we expect approximately a $7 million reduction on a consolidated basis. And this is made up of a $2 million reduction in Canada; $5 million reduction in Europe; and no significant change elsewhere.", "So that gives you a head start on the MG&A impact of discontinuing sales curve accounting in our businesses starting in 2014 and what we'll be looking at from a comparison standpoint with the 2013 results.", "Note that these changes in MG&A expenses I gave you will have exactly the inverse effect on pretax income in the quarters mentioned and for the business units that I mentioned. We plan to provide more detailed information for you within the next few weeks.", "So with that, Ryan, we'd like to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A couple of questions. Going back to the Tradeteam arrangement that disappeared, the commentary was that will lead to best commercial terms. Is it going to be long-term margin benefit in terms of logistic costs coming down from the previous levels you have in Europe?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. That's a good question, Ian. Really one of the primary drivers that -- for -- essentially changing our situation with distribution with Tradeteam in the U.K. was, essentially, to improve the rates and therefore the improving ongoing economics of the situation for us. Spencer did allude to that earlier, we do expect better rates.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes. So, I mean, for FY '14, there will be some benefit coming through in Europe and the U.K. from that.", "David Dunnewald", "The anticipation is for ongoing benefits, that's correct.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just going on to the Miller brand situation in -- this Miller brand situation in Canada, $80 million write off, and I think, last December you had about $70 million on the balance sheet, which mathematically is about, the sort of 25%. Simple view, is that saying you think that there's 75% chance of keeping the contract?", "David Dunnewald", "Fair question. I would say no, it's not a, I call it, a direct indication of what we think the probabilities of keeping or not keeping the contract. Really, the asset value on our books is driven by a range of probability-weighted scenarios. Then when we take those in total, we've cited that there was appropriate value of that tangible asset downward.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Okay. So I mean the accounting value shifted a little bit in the last year, but you've had to -- you've written off $18 million what is probably a little bit less than $70 million as the starting point. Is that right?", "David Dunnewald", "I'm sorry, say that again, Ian?", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I said the $70 million was from the December 2012 balance sheet. And obviously, we would've expected it would moderate slightly through the year. So it will be a slightly low number anyway at December 30, even if you did not have the write off.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. Okay. So, actually, Brian has got a more specific number on that one. Do you want to share that with them?", "Brian Tabolt", "Yes. So the amortization expense is approximately $10 million per annum. So the balance prior to the impairment would have been circa $1 million.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Great. And final question for me, just thinking about the free cash flow guidance that has been lower than '13. Is it another factor the fact you're going to have more cash restructuring costs this year, particularly in Canada? Is that something that's probably the reconciliation there?", "David Dunnewald", "So when we look at our, essentially, forecast and, therefore, target for free cash flow for the year, there are a lot of factors that go into that. And yes, I guess, to the extent that there's cash used for restructuring and that will be part of it. However, keep in mind that in 2013, we had some substantial restructuring going on in various parts of the business. So I would not call that a major driver of the change and the difference between 2013 and 2012. And also one other point, the actual restructuring costs are excluded from our underlying free cash flow calculation. I guess that's your main answer right there.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "So the main -- just coming back to the sort of main reconciliation to -- cash flow will be effectively targeted to almost 200 million light. I mean it's mainly the working capital as a swing factor here.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes, that is the biggest single factor. We do have a bit of a CapEx increase in Canada, which we talked about on the earlier call. So -- but, yes, primarily it's related to working capital.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Earlier in the year, I think you guys gave guidance that marketing spend will be up $30 million or more than $30 million in the year. Can you give us a number of what that was?", "David Dunnewald", "We might be able to give you a little bit of guidance around that. Let's see, that was on a full year basis. As we roll through the year, let's just say that our marketing and sales spending was roughly in line with our expectations.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. And I assume there's no way I can get one -- or your expectations for '14?", "David Dunnewald", "Not at this point, no. You know our philosophy, right? I mean, we intend to invest behind our brands, innovation above premium and core brands are the primary focus. And we have a bias to invest when we have good ideas and good opportunities to drive those brands. So we've generally had, not only a strong level of investment, but generally, unless there's a -- there was a, how do you say it, something duplicative. For example, if you put 2 businesses together, something like that. Or there are other situations where there may be a way to cut marketing and sales spending and still maintain the impact. With the exception of those situations, generally, we've had similar or moderately increasing marketing and sales spend over a longer period of time.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. Is there any way that you could give us the pension expense breakout by region, just for modeling purposes? I know you gave the overall number today, I was just trying to put that through your regions.", "David Dunnewald", "Let's see, there will be more of that information in the 10-K, if I recall correctly.", "Brian Tabolt", "We don't have it by region.", "David Dunnewald", "Oh, yes. Okay, Brian is correcting me, we don't have it by region in the K. We've -- but you do have visibility or you will have visibility when we file it over the next -- in the next few days. That's the anticipated filing time. A visibility to MillerCoors and then the pensions -- the rest of the company essentially.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Yes, I'm sorry. But were the numbers that were given out today, were those inclusive or exclusive of MillerCoors?", "David Dunnewald", "Those are including MillerCoors.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "42% of MillerCoors or all of it?", "David Dunnewald", "42%.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. Last question for me is just, would you be willing to give us a breakdown of savings either in '13 or, ideally, expectation '14, between cost of goods sold and SG&A?", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. So what I'd tell you is that the savings in 2013 lean toward MG&A. And we expect that as we move further into some of the cost savings initiatives that we have going on, those will migrate so that they lean a bit more toward COGS in the future, over the coming years, so to speak. And by the way, the cost savings will also tend to migrate toward Canada this year, relative to last year when they were more heavily centered in the U.K.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Luddy from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Luddy - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just on the calendar shift impact that we saw this quarter, are there any other quarters that you would want to call out for 2014 that are impacted by that?", "David Dunnewald", "No, that's the big one. Brian is saying he's not aware of any other significant ones. You have minor shift because the days don't line up exactly or whatever. But the number of days should be essentially consistent through the year. And now, at the end of 2014, we will have a period that's slightly -- 3 days shorter than the fourth quarter of 2013. So that will be a comparison challenge, I guess. So that's the main issue to be aware of.", "Michael Luddy - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then on Europe, can you just give a little bit more color on, I guess, both the top line and the rest of that business? I guess which are you -- I guess the market was down about 3% on volume this year, are you still thinking that it's going to be a down market, broadly, for you in 2014? Is there any major variance in pricing outlook by region? And then also, I just want to get a little bit more color on why COGS per hectoliter are going down.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. Okay, so a few questions there. On Europe outlook volume or, call it, performance of the market, no, I'm not going to provide a crystal ball on that one. As you know, the eurozone has been very challenged, particularly over the last 2 years. What I can say is that our business, within the context of that very difficult situation, has actually performed relatively well. I mean, you can see that show up in the share numbers and the profit numbers and the pricing numbers and so on. So pricing actually has been -- has held up despite the difficult situation there. You've seen some negative mix in Europe, and that is driven mostly by -- I mean a little bit of channel mix going on there. But, primarily, it's more geographic as in when our sales tend to -- the total sales mix by country, if it increases in places where the revenue per hectoliter, for example, is not as favorable, then you will see a negative mix impact on the NSR line. However, one other effect of that, aside from just tight cost control, is the cost of goods also has -- can have an advantage there, too. Because in the markets where NSR is lower, in some cases, the cost of goods are also lower. And for some pack types, the same thing could be said. It's lower NSR, but it's also lower COGS in a particular market or in a particular channel, the same -- you can get the same effect.", "Michael Luddy - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then could you just remind me one more time on your leverage target, is it on debt to EBITDA or net debt to EBITDA?", "David Dunnewald", "It is underlying -- oh, sorry. Leverage target. Yes. Well, we have to look at a number of different targets when we talk about leverage. The 2 that we generally talked about are the most conservative one, which is the S&P kind of leverage ratio. And that would include lots of liabilities beyond debt. And there we've talked about getting that ratio in the range of bellow 3x adjusted EBITDA, as S&P called it. And then from -- but actually, the most commonly used metric is net debt, which you referred to. And that one we're getting in the range of just south of 2 -- 2x underlying EBITDA. That's the goal on that one. And they kind of move in tandem, if you know what I mean, because they have different denominators and different numerators.", "Operator", "We have no further questions in queue.", "David Dunnewald", "Okay. Great. Well, thank you. Okay. Thanks, Ryan. In closing, we'd like to thank all of you for your interest in Molson Coors and for joining us today. If you have additional questions that we did not cover during our time this afternoon, please call Kevin Kim or me on our direct lines or at the main number here at Molson Coors, which is (303) 927-BEER or 927-2337.

Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning, welcome to the Molson Coors Brewing Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.", "Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.", "The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the day they are made. Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in U.S. dollars.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Peter Swinburn, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thank you, Jerry. Hello, and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call, and thank you for joining us today.", "With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, Molson Coors' Controller; and Dave Dunnewald Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.", "On the call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2014 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the balance of 2014.", "In the first quarter, Molson Coors more than doubled underlying after-tax income, grew underlying EBITDA more than 20% and expanded gross operating and after-tax margins. Underlying earnings per share also more than doubled. U.S. GAAP after-tax earnings increased more than $135 million versus a year ago. The improvement across our company was consistent with each of our businesses achieving improved operating margins, pretax earnings and EBITDA performance in the quarter.", "Our strong focus on our core brands, our portfolio shift to above-premium and value creating innovation is paying dividends. This strategy is underpinned by our Profit After Capital Charge, or PACC model, which aligns our entire team and each of our cash-use decisions with our priorities.", "In the first quarter, Coors Light grew more than 30% in the United Kingdom, and it more than doubled in Mexico and Latin America. Coors Light underperformed in the U.S. and in Canada and we have plans to reverse this trend as we approach the summer selling season, which I will share with you in a few minutes.", "Carling continued strong momentum from last year, with both volume and market share growth in Europe and particularly in the United Kingdom, where it extended its lead as the #1 beer brand. Molson Canadian gained share for the third consecutive quarter in Canada, with its Olympic programming, including the hugely successful Molson Canadian beer bridge social media program and Coors Banquet grew volume and share in both the U.S. and Canada.", "Staropramen grew volume and share across Central Europe but this brand's licensed volume declined in Russia and the Ukraine due to political and economic turmoil.", "In the quarter, U.S. pretax earnings increased nearly 5% and while we saw positive pricing and sales mix, together with cost savings, the gain was also due to the timing of marketing spending versus last year. Industry volume declined in the first quarter, partially related to the negative impact of the Easter holiday timing. Premium Light's continued to underperform the overall market but we gained share in the Premium Light segment according to Nielsen, driven by the successful reintroduction of Miller Lite's Original Lite can. We also grew share in above-premiums, but we have work to do on our Blue Moon Seasonal brands.", "In Canada, our volume was lower, partially due to the timing of Easter holiday. Our overall market share declined about 0.5 share point versus a year ago on a comparable basis, which takes up the Modelo brands in Canada. And above-premium Coors Banquet delivered strong volume growth and our Kraft brands, Primo and Granville Island, grew volume and share. Canada income also benefited from the timing of marketing and sales expenses, lower overhead costs and higher net pricing, all of which drove higher pretax income and margins in the quarter.", "Although the economy remains weak, our Europe business delivered 5.6% volume growth and more than 1 point of share growth across the region, along with cost reductions and improved margins and pretax income. Our brands grew overall share in the Czech Republic, Romania, United Kingdom and Bulgaria, while we saw improved trends in Serbia and Hungary.", "Our International business improved its top line and bottom line performance by growing volume double digits and improving its sales mix and cost base. The team continued to achieve strong Coors Light growth in Mexico and Latin America and improved their performance in China.", "And now I'll turn it over to Gavin to give first quarter financial highlights and the perspective on the balance of 2014. Gavin?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors' first quarter underlying after-tax earnings increased 115.2% to $102.2 million, or $0.55 per share, driven by improved financial results in all of our businesses, along with less interest expense. This strong profit performance also increased margins versus a year ago. Our first quarter underlying tax rate of 5% was lower than prior year due to the release of valuation allowances in Europe and favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions.", "Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 0.1% due to lower volume in United States and Canada, offset by higher volume in Europe and international.", "In the first quarter, our U.S. GAAP after-tax income from continuing operations increased $135.9 million to $165.3 million due to strong business performance and $63.1 million of special and other noncore net gains in the quarter, which compared to $21.9 million of special and other noncore net charges a year earlier. Special and other noncore items this year are excluded from our underlying results, and primarily related to income recognized upon the early termination of our joint venture that managed the Modelo brands in Canada, along with a favorable resolution of indirect tax reserves in Europe.", "These gains are partially offset by an intangible asset write-off associated with the Modelo JV termination in Canada, along with restructuring-related costs in Canada and Europe. Special and other noncore items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "Overall, when considering our first quarter results, it's important to note this is a seasonally small profit quarter for our business. So relatively small changes in absolute income results can drive large percentage changes.", "As we have in previous quarters, I will provide an overview by results of MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionally consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business. On this basis, total company net sales decreased 0.7% from the prior year, driven by lower volume and unfavorable foreign currency movements, which were partially offset by positive pricing and mix. On a per hectoliter basis, net sales decreased 0.2% due to negative foreign currency, nearly offset by positive pricing and mix in United States and international, and higher pricing in Canada. Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter decreased 1.8% due to favorable foreign currency in Canada and lower costs in Europe.", "Total company underlying gross margin was 37.4%, 100 basis points higher than a year ago, primarily due to gross margin expansion in Europe, Canada and international.", "Underlying marketing, general and administrative expenses declined 6%, driven by all business segments and corporate. Underlying operating margin was 9.2%, up 260 basis points from a year ago, due to margin improvement in all businesses.", "Our underlying EBITDA was $251.2 million in the first quarter, 20.4% higher than a year ago, driven by improvements in all of our businesses and in corporate. This year earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "In addition, please see Table 7 in the earnings release for constant currency, net sales, pretax income and underlying pretax income for each of our segments and for our total company. We believe that these new disclosures will provide investors with more comparable data of which to analyze our company.", "As mentioned on our last earnings call, beginning in 2014, we have discontinued sales curve accounting for our marketing and sales expense. This change will have no effect in the total amount of annual marketing and sales spending reported, but it does affect the quarterly timing of this expense. This change in accounting policy is being presented retrospectively. So we have recost prior periods to reflect the new treatment, including for the first quarter 2013 results distributed this morning.", "The elimination of sales curve accounting has the effect of increasing the previously reported first quarter 2013 MG&A expense by approximately $9 million, which was offset in the second half of the year. We posted the specific 2013 quarterly impacts on our website earlier this morning. MillerCoors does not use sales curve accounting, so its historical results will not be affected by this change.", "Underlying free cash flow for the first quarter of 2014 totaled a use of $65 million. This was a $16 million higher cash use versus a year ago and was driven by working capital timing, which was partially offset by higher net income. The underlying free cash flow in the first quarter does not include a $62.9 million noncore cash receipt related to the early termination of our Modelo brands joint venture in Canada. Net free cash use in the first quarter of the year is normal in a seasonal business. The business is the lowest profit and cash generating time of the year.", "Our first quarter 2014 free cash flow included the following factors: $150 million of operating cash flow, and $57 million of net deductions, mainly the cash received for the accelerated termination of the Modelo joint venture in Canada, partially offset by cash used for restructuring activities. Investing cash outflows was $65 million of capital spending.", "Our underlying free cash flow included $123 million of cash distributions and $95 million of cash invested in MillerCoors, along with $4 million of positive adjustments for special charges and investments in businesses.", "Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.79 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $338 million, resulting in net debt of $3.46 billion, approximately $98 million higher than 3 months earlier and $685 million lower than a year earlier.", "In the first quarter, we paid off the remaining outstanding cross currency swaps for $65.2 million. And paid $46.3 million of principal temporarily withheld from the repayment of the EUR 500 million note issued to us by the seller of our Central Europe business.", "Looking forward to 2014, we are lowering our full year guidance for tax rate in NCR cost of goods sold per hectoliter. We now expect our 2014 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 16%, down from 16% to 20% previously. This change is primarily due to an advance pricing agreement we signed with tax authorities early in the second quarter, along with a favorable impact of some discrete tax benefits recognized in the first quarter. After this year, we expect our underlying tax rate to be near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24%, for at least a few years, assuming no further changes in tax loss, settlements of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "For Molson Coors International cost of goods sold per hectoliter, we now expect a low-single digit increase, down from mid single-digits previously. All other full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter, such that underlying free cash flow guidance is $700 million, plus or minus 10%. We expect defined benefit pension expense of approximately $35 million and cash contributions of $60 million to $90 million, including our 42% share of MillerCoors' expense in cash. We also anticipate 2014 capital spending of approximately $350 million, corporate MG&A expense of approximately $110 million and consolidated net interest expense of approximately $145 million.", "In 2014 cost outlook, we continue to expect MillerCoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase with a low-single digit rate for the full year. In local currency, we still expect Canada to increase in the low-single digit rate and in Europe, to decrease to the low-single digit rate.", "And at this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. So overall, our strategy of building our core and above-premium brands, and driving sales with our innovation pipeline is working. In the U.S., we will continue transitioning our portfolio towards the high-margin and fast-growing above-premium segment.", "The rollouts of Miller Fortune lager and Smith & Forge Cider are progressing and Redd's Apple Ale continues to be one of the fastest-growing brands in the U.S. beer category. Premium Lights continue to underperform the overall market, and we are addressing this in the coming months with new advertising, fresh packaging and our Coors Light line extension, Coors Light Summer Brew.", "We are also putting more TV support behind our key value brands, Miller High Life and Keystone Light. We expect to see a reversal of the marketing timing benefit that contributed to the first quarter of MillerCoors' underlying income growth.", "Our volume and profit performance in Canada in the first quarter was impacted by the February 28 termination of our arrangement for the Modelo brands. The negative impact on underlying income of losing the Modelo brands was more than offset by the results of multi-year initiatives started last year to transform and streamline our cost base, as well as year-over-year differences in the timing of marketing and sales spending.", "We will introduce new advertising this month and increase activity to improve the performance of Coors Light. We have a strong innovation pipeline, which will be led by the expansion of Coors Banquet and our vented can, but which will also include 2 new products for the range [ph] of recruiting legal-aged drinkers from outside the beer category.", "Europe is still experiencing constrained demand, which is fueling the growth of lower margin segments and channels. While we expect this trend to continue, the work we have done on improving our brand propositions and execution has resulted in strong share growth in nearly all of our markets. For the balance of 2014, we have strong core brand, above-premium and innovation plans, including the rollout of cider and the introduction of cold-activated packaging to select central European markets.", "Our International business has launched global above-premium brands in select high potential markets, including Coors and Blue Moon in Australia and Carling in major tourist destinations in India in the first quarter. For the remainder of 2014, we plan to rollout above-premium brands to additional markets on a selective basis, along with premium outlet distribution gains for our lead brands in China.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the second quarter. In the U.S. for April, STRs decreased low-single digits. In Canada, they were approximately flat. Excluding the Modelo brands last year, our Canada STRs in April increased at a low-single digit rate. Our April sales volume in Europe increased at a high-single digit rate, and our international sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a double-digit rate.", "All of these April results benefited from the timing of Easter this year and also as ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "To summarize our discussions today, in the first quarter, we more than doubled underlying after-tax income, grew underlying EBITDA more than 20% and expanded gross operating and after-tax margins. Underlying earnings per share also more than doubled. The improvement across our company was consistent, with each of our businesses achieving improved operating margins, pretax earnings and EBITDA performance in the quarter.", "While the economy and beer volumes remain weak in many of our markets, our focus on driving cash generation, raising returns on capital and delivering Profit After Capital Charge was instrumental in achieving these results. This year, we have cash generation, PACC and total shareholder return, along with profit and top line growth as key performance criteria in our employee incentive programs, which is designed to align our decision-making and our priorities to drive long-term shareholder value.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a few quick comments. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. And also at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "Additionally, in the next 2 months, we hope to see many of you at 3 events: First, Gavin will present at the Goldman Sachs Staples Summit in New York on Tuesday, May 13; second, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday, June 4, 2014, here in Denver at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel; and third, we will host our Annual New York Investor Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange on the afternoon of Wednesday, June 25, 2014.", "Having said that, we would like to open it up for questions. Jay, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First, just maybe on Canada, just a couple of questions. One is just the STR improvement that you've seen in April. Seems pretty nice just versus what you saw in Q1. So can you just talk about how much of that is just comparison getting a little bit easier versus maybe the market getting a little bit better or your brand performing better? And then staying with Canada, just this is now the second quarters in a row where you got positive net pricing realization. So can you talk about how sustainable that is and what you're seeing from a competitive perspective?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Judy, well, I'll let Stewart answer in detail in a minute. But just on the first point, with Easter, the weather really was consistently poor over Easter as it was early on in the year so that didn't help us. In terms of the overall comparisons and the improvement, Stewart can give you the fine detail. But generally, it was driven by the fact that Easter was in the second quarter and I think most of the momentum in terms of the like-for-like sales is driven by that factor. Stewart? Stewart?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Peter, sorry, I got disconnected.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Did you hear the question?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "I didn't hear the question. I got disconnected right as Judy started to talk.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Judy, I don't want to misrepresent you. Would you mind repeating your question?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. So just on Canada, for the first question which I think Peter answered to some extent was just the STR trend improvements in April, how much of that was timing, Easter comparison, et cetera? And then the second question was just really looking at your pricing realization in Canada. 2 quarters in a row where you actually got positive pricing realization. So can you talk about how sustainable that is in the context of the competitive landscape?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Okay, right.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Stewart, just so you're aware, in terms of Easter question, I basically said that the weather was poor over Easter as it was in the first quarter. But most of the momentum in terms of the sales was driven by the fact that it was the Easter holiday. So I'll pass it over to you now.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, thanks, Peter. Peter is exactly right on that, Judy. And I think underlying trends were still there but we had the benefit of shifting the holiday from one quarter to another. So nothing I could see in the market that had changed dramatically. On the pricing side, look, we're very pleased with the result this quarter. And in truth, when you look at what's happening from a pricing perspective, we have been very focused on how we're promoting our products, how we're pricing our products to make sure that they're attractive to consumers. What you're seeing from a pricing perspective is the result of a very balanced program. So what is it going to look like in the future? Of course, I can't give you guidance on that but I think we've taken a good approach to the last couple of quarters.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And any changes in terms of the competitive landscape, Stewart?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, I mean, we do continue to see a fair amount of discounting. We continue to see particularly at the value end of spectrum, that people are being aggressive. And that is just a reflection of a much weaker market. So you would expect that having said that, inside of that, we've been performing relatively well. We gained share in value and we've been gaining share of the kraft segment. And our core brands outside of Coors Light have been performing well. So yes, that's maybe if you got the follow-on from that, that's how I see it.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just maybe for Gavin, just if we look at the quarter, certainly the quarter came in better than I think what most people expected from a cost perspective, both on the gross margin side and the operating margin side. And I guess, what I'm trying to really understand is how much is this timing-driven, which relates to the marketing spend timing that you had called out? And then how much is this really just the increased focus on your cost-savings initiatives and really the step-up -- aligning your incentives with the PACC model. So maybe you can talk about the MG&A without the marketing spending, timing, how much that would've been down on an underlying basis? And then just give as an update on your cost-savings initiatives and the focus there and how much of that is driving a better margin behavior in the last few quarters?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Okay. Well, I'll do my best for you, Judy, because there's quite a bit of detail in that, which we probably wouldn't go into. If I try and summarize it and hopefully, this will be helpful, in terms of our marketing spend overall, this year, we fully expect to spend at least the same as we did last year, if not more. In terms of our cost savings, we said last year in New York that we were aiming at an ongoing $40 million to $60 million per year. We're very comfortable that we're going to hit that number in our cost -- in terms of overall cost savings. I think really that's as much detail that I can give you at the moment.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Would you share with us what the number was on the cost savings in the quarter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Judy, we're not doing that. We're going to give you an annual feel for that. So Peter's quite right there, we're quite comfortable we're going to hit the $40 million to $60 million. And as we said last year, we expect to be at the upper end of that range for a couple of years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Faucher with JP Morgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And looking at the gross margin performance on the European business, obviously very strong performance this quarter. It's a seasonally weak gross margin quarter for that business, the comp seemed relatively easy. Can you just talk maybe a little bit conceptually or if you want to give us numbers, sort of how we should think about that improvement as we progress to more seasonally higher gross margins and how much of this you think is structural versus just sort of an easy comparison?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, John. What I would say to you is you're quite right. I mean the first quarter is a seasonally low quarter for us. Quarters 2 and quarters 3 are our big quarters in Europe, so they're particularly important for us. As far as COGS are concerned, I would just draw your attention back to the guidance, which we've given you on COGS for Europe for the full year, which was to decrease at a low-single digit rate.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "And just to put some contact to color on to that, John. You've obviously, aware that there's a number of different dynamics going on in Europe. We do have -- because of again, as Stewart mentioned in Canada, because of the prevailing economic conditions, we do have a movement towards lower value price -- value brands, I'm sorry, but also lower priced channels, and that's working against us. But on the positive sense, our core brands are performing very well across Europe and also we're managing to get good growth in our above-premium business, especially with Staropramen. And we have quite an exciting innovation program coming online as well. So all of those dynamics play to the overall gross margin and as Gavin said, you do have the guidance on the COGS.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And I guess, just sort of trying to dig a little bit deeper on the guidance on the COGS to understand it, I guess, what's the level of structural benefit that you're seeing here that's driving that reduction in COGS per hectoliter? Can you sort of breakout raw materials versus sort of more structural cost-saving components -- just conceptually, again?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Well, we don't break down our cost-to-goods-sold to the level of detail which I know you'd probably like, John. But I mean, there are any number of factors that go into that. We've obviously got the cost savings program, so a portion of that $40 million to $60 million, which Peter and I talked about earlier, does lie in the cost-of-goods-sold area and does lie obviously in Europe. You've got brand and channel mix. you've got packaging mix. I mean, there are any number of factors and decomposing any one of them, I can't do, so we'll just point you to our full year guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A couple of questions on the guidance. And we're reducing the COGS guidance for Canada. And I just wondered what was behind that. I think, you sort of had flagged that probably better mix will be one of the components to increase that. And the second question was around interest, where you're keeping the guidance at 145, and obviously, that's despite quite a low number in Q1 at 35. Is there something exceptional in that 35? Is the underlying rate a little higher than that, Gavin?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "I think you must've misheard me on -- we have kept our guidance on cost-of-goods-sold for Canada the same, at an increase of low-single digits. The guidance I changed was for Molson Coors International, which was previously increased mid-single digits and we reduced that to increase low-single digits. And that's just a function of Molson Coors International operation in many countries and it's just a shift of where we might put -- where the cost of goods sold are coming from a country and a type of business point of view. So that's the first point. On the interest, our guidance is what it is. And we haven't changed it.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "If you take my point, I mean, as the year goes on, you'd expect your net debt to be coming down and as you analyze the $35 million we still end up less than $145 million. So it just strikes me there's something a little bit exceptional in terms of credit in there?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "There are no big changes to our cash flow guidance, again we spent $700 million plus or minus 10%. Obviously, we had working capital shifts during the year, which might also drive changes in our cash balances and in what we're drawing down on our commercial paper program.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just a follow-up. Peter, just to clarify where we are with the SAB brands in Canada now?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Which brands? Sorry, the SABMiller....", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Yes, the SABMiller brands in Canada?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, we both tried to get to a solution on that, which didn't work. And so we are waiting for a court date, which we think will be at the end of the fall to go back to discuss the issue with a judge.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Sorry, you said in the fall, that will be... in the autumn?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes. I think it's going to be in November.", "Operator", "The next question comes from my Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "My first, I guess, first question was just a little bit more color in Canada. And Stewart, maybe could you talk a little bit about, quickly, you lost a little bit of share but was just interesting -- interested in the dynamic between Molson Canadian and maybe Coors Light and we've just spoken before about how much progress you've made in really stabilizing Molson Canadian. So can you talk a little bit about just the duck [ph] share dynamic there in the first quarter? Has there been any improvement in Coors Light and how Canadian performed?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Can I -- I'll just jump in first, but I'm going to let Stewart give you the detail. We really don't see too much overlap between Canadian and Coors Light. It is there. What has affected Coors Light probably more than anything else in the first quarter was Banquet. So we tend to look at each brand individually. We're very pleased, obviously, with the way we turned Canadian around over the last 3 years. Coors Light remains very strong in terms of brand health metrics and so that's a real positive. But we do believe we've got more work to do in terms of the programming and also the create of execution. So Stewart, do you want to talk to the specifics of what we're planning?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, sure. I mean, look, in total, we feel good about the shared performance but not great. Good in the sense that on a historical basis, we're seeing -- we're starting to see some improvement in overall shared performance. We don't feel great because, frankly, losing share is not where we want to be. When we look at the underlying components of the portfolio that we're trying to transform, there's a lot of good healthy stuff that's going on. As I mentioned earlier in the call, growing share in value, growing share in craft, we're premiumizing the portfolio, Banquet is doing really well. Canadian, we couldn't be happier with, of course -- you and the Rest of World would've seen the red fridge in Sochi. So all of the pieces of our portfolio working well. Coors Light continues to be a drag. Peter's right, there is overlap between Coors Banquet and Coors Light. When you look at the trademark in total, so those 2 combined, then the share is much closer to flat for the 2 brands combined. But nevertheless, we are very, very focused on making sure that Coors Light -- making sure that Coors Light changes its current trajectory. And as I mentioned in last quarter's call, you will see new creative very shortly and you will see an action-packed summer of execution that we're looking forward to getting on with.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then could you also just a little bit or any comment on just performance in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec. If I remember last year, part of your overall performance relative to the market was affected by how you index in those provinces. So can you just talk about, I guess, geographic mix and how that might have affected your performance relative to the market?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. got it. Well, look, on a combined basis, Coors and Coors Banquet, that performance is much better out West. Good in the Atlantic, pretty good in Ontario, not really a factor in Qu\u00e9bec because we don't have Banquet there yet. We are expecting to launch banquet into Qu\u00e9bec later this year and we think that will work very, very well on the portfolio. Coors Light, I would say, if you looked across the country with the Atlantic provinces excepted, Coors Light had a number of challenges across a lot of the country and it relates to the drivers that again, I covered during last quarter.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just I had one last question. Can we get, or maybe I missed this, just the disclosure of price and mix in terms of the revenue build for both Europe and Canada?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. So I'm happy to just talk to Canada briefly. Pretty much everything that you saw coming through from a price perspective was driven by price and not by mix. Mix was not much of a factor in the quarter.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And do you have it for Europe as well?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, underlying for Europe was pricing was down about 2% and mix was also down on just under 100 basis points.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you perhaps talk a little bit more about the U.S. competitive environment? I guess, ABI had these 25-ounce cans. Do you see that as a price cut? How are you dealing with that in the marketplace? Is that really having much effect? There's talk about them being aggressive on-premise and any color around that? And then also, any color around your April results or what you're seeing so far in April in light of the change in the Easter holiday?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "So I'll let Tom respond to the specifics you've raised, Robert. But I think for the U.S., if you read the same for the U.S. as for most of our business, we laid out the fact that we wanted to premiumize the portfolio, check [ph] that we're moving in the right direction. We laid out the fact that we wanted a strong ongoing innovation tool around check [ph] . We're doing that. We're growing in every segment apart from the economy segments and we're seeing good pricing and mix movement so more work to do. The issue still revolves around getting Premium Lights firing on all cylinders. But Tom, do you want to respond to the specifics that Robert raised?", "Tom Long", "Yes. So just to support Peter there, we're really executing our strategy over time. I mean we took a tiny bit of share in Premium Light 0.01 point. We took almost 200-basis-point share segment in above-premium. We took about 20 basis points in Premium Regular and we lost 140 basis points in share segment in economy. And that leads to your question about the 25-ounce can and 24-ounce can. The economy business has been challenged since the recession. And it really hasn't come back and we haven't really seen that sector come back, even though jobs are increasing and it looks like that's going to take a while for that business to come back. There's been some commentary about consumers using beer as a more affordable luxury, and perhaps that business is challenged for the longer term. There are some value plays going out there in beer. I wouldn't say the effect of pricing is any more intense than it's been historically. The moves in the on-premise were addressed at the other conference call as ABI is moving in 2 states with some on-premise pricing. That's in distributorships which they wholly own. It hasn't spread yet. And it hasn't hurt our business yet, but we continue to watch that very carefully, of course. So I would simply say that the place where the competitive dynamics are becoming more intense and rightly so is the on-premise, where there's a real highly competitive arena for tap handles which are really visible to consumers and important for our business. And that's the place where our business has gotten a little soft and needs a little focus. But I don't think the value of plays or the pricing environment in the U.S. is any different structurally than it has been in the past.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Just specifically on the 25 ounces, which I think they're using across-the-board, aren't they, with also Bud and Bud light, are they having -- do you sense that they're having any impact in the market? I mean, is there any pressure for you to do something like that as well?", "Tom Long", "Well, we always look at our value equations and you've got -- as you see in C-stores, the single business continues to be a big part of that business and a growing part of that business. And it's a part where value equations play. Now there's a lot of movement between those sectors on a price point basis. I wouldn't expect us to respond in kind to a 1-ounce difference on a 25-ounce, 24-ounce can.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And then just finally, can you give us your sense of how Miller Fortune is doing compared to your expectations and the timing of the media spend? Which quarters is that likely to be the most and how that should play out?", "Tom Long", "Yes. So Miller Fortune, we've gained 30 basis points of volume share and more than that in value share. Our distributors cooperated beautifully in getting that brand out there. We're pleased with it early on, although that brand is settling into the parts of the market where we have more significant repeat rates. But we're very pleased with it at this stage and we'll continue to support it. We've had good support going forward as we launched the brand and we'll have it in the second quarter as well.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Do you have data that supports -- that it's taking share from spirits as intended? Or is it more from other beer brands, do you think?", "Tom Long", "The data that we have from our chains that are on-premise suggest that it's doing a nice job of bringing new consumers in. And our business at C-stores, from our major chains, suggest it's incremental to the beer category. I don't have the data with me that suggest it's taking from spirits in that channel but I do know about its incrementality in the C-store channel.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "And Robert, just to build on that as well and Tom mentioned it in the MillerCoors call earlier, but if you look at the overall NSR per hectoliter for the U.S., it's over 3%. 50% of that is coming from mix, only 50% from pricings, that's a healthy position to be in.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple of questions on Canada. I don't know if this is for Peter or Stewart or Gavin. But it sounds like you've agreed to disagree on this suit with SABMiller and you'll get clarity here in November. Can you just give us some parameters here? There's been, I think, a fair amount of confusion out there in the market about how impactful this really is from a share perspective and from an earnings perspective to your business? And then I had a kind of more delicate second question.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "So what we quoted in the past, Mark, is less than 1% of our overall profit for the business. So it's immaterial as far as we're concerned.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Great, great. And then Stewart, certainly we've gotten some color here on Canada and a lot of work yet to be done, some good things at least in the month of April. But is there -- can you give us some more color like in the month of April, particularly, that's -- obviously it's only a month but it's a big improvement. Is that purely the industry recovering here? Is it also some improvement in share? When you're kind of trying to pull the hood up, are you seeing any evidence that you're either the industry or your share trends are improving or is it all -- is that not the case?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Stewart?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. So look, short answer, Mark, is I think that the underlying trend is continuing. This is an industry trend. It's underlying. And there's no data I've received coming out of April yet that would tell me anything different.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "So am I right, you said flat for Canada, that sounds like the...", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "No, I didn't say that what's the share was because I actually don't have share data yet for April. What I can say is that in terms of looking at the market and what I see in the market, how customers are behaving, what people tell me, how I see our competitors performing, what I'm seeing is a benefit from Easter and when I strip out what I think I lost from Q1 and I layer it into April, what I see is really the benefit of Easter and no real change to the underlying market.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So just to make sure I'm hearing you right, and again, I realize it's only a month but it sounds like you're saying the industry simply got better from a volume perspective in the month of April?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, the industry got better because of Easter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There are no additional questions at this time.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Thank you, Jay, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today.

Hello, and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earning call, and thank you for joining us today.", "With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, Molson Coors' Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations.", "One quick note before we discuss the quarter. You'll all be aware of my intention to retire from Molson Coors at the end of this year. I'm delighted that Mark Hunter has been named as my successor. I've worked with Mark for over 20 years, and I cannot think of any one better qualified to take the business on to continued success.", "Mark has played a key role in developing and implementing our company's strategy over the past 7 years as a member of our executive leadership team, and he and the team here plan to continue to execute the strategy that we have set for the company.", "Also, Mark will join Gavin and me at the Barclay's Back-to-School Conference in Boston in a few weeks. But our time today is focused on earnings. So for the balance of the call today, Gavin and I will take you through the highlights of our second quarter 2014 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the second half of 2014.", "In the second quarter, Molson Coors increased underlying after-tax income nearly 8%, grew underlying EBITDA 4% and expanded gross operating and after-tax margins. Underlying earnings per share increased nearly 7%, and U.S. GAAP after-tax earnings increased 9.5% versus a year ago. We continue to build a bigger and stronger brand portfolio that is delivering value-added innovation, continued investment in our core brands and increased our share in above-premium. As a result, we achieved positive pricing and mix, resulting in higher net sales in the quarter. We also continue to improve our operations by reducing costs, implementing common processes and focusing on Profit After Capital Charge as the key driver for our cash and capital allocation strategy.", "In the second quarter, Coors Light global volume, including our proportional percentage of MillerCoors volume, increased nearly 5% versus a year ago. Coors Light grew more than 30% in the United Kingdom and even faster in Mexico and Latin America, underscoring the increasingly important role of Molson Coors International to the business. The brand underperformed in the U.S. and in Canada, and we continue to implement plans to reverse these trends.", "Molson Canadian volume in Canada was even with prior year, while Coors Banquet grew volume and share in both the U.S. and Canada. Carling, the #1 brand in the United Kingdom and the largest brand in our Europe business, continued to grow volume, and our Europe above-premium portfolio continued to grow strongly, led by Coors Light, Cobra and Doom Bar.", "Staropramen volume decreased overall versus the second quarter of 2013 as a result of lower volumes in Russia and Ukraine related to political and economic turmoil. Despite the severe flooding in Central Europe this year, above-premium Staropramen, and that is the Staropramen we sell outside of the Czech Republic, maintained volume in the region.", "In the quarter, U.S. pretax earnings increased more than 10%, driven by positive pricing, sales mix and cost savings. Premium and Premium Light beers continued to underperform the overall market, but Miller Lite sales in the Original Lite Can continued to grow as did Coors Banquet. We also gained volume and market share with the above-premium Redd's, Leinenkugel Summer Shandy, Smith & Forge Hard Cider and Miller Fortune brands.", "In Canada, our termination of the distribution rights from the Modelo brands early this year drove all of the sales-to-retail decline in the second quarter and more than all the earnings decrease in constant currency. Coors Light trends improved sequentially from high single-digit decline in the first quarter to a low single-digit decline in the second quarter, but we have more work to do on our largest brand. In above-premium, Coors Banquet continued to deliver strong volume growth, and the combined Coors Light and Banquet brand family grew volume low single-digits from a year ago. And our Craft brands, Creemore and Granville Island, increased volume and share. Canada income also benefited from lower marketing spending and higher net pricing versus a year ago.", "Our Europe business improved its financial performance through positive geographic mix and cost reductions, which more than offset increased marketing investment and drove improved margins. This positive financial result was delivered against a backdrop of devastating floods in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia in May and Bulgaria in June.", "Our Europe market share declined 0.7 of a percentage point as floods primarily impacted our highest share areas in these countries, and we did not participate in value-destructive off-premise promotional activity over the World Cup period in the United Kingdom. We grew share in Czech Republic, Romania and Hungary in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our overall market share in Europe was even with a year ago.", "Our International business continues improving its top line performance by growing volume and net sales at double-digit rates. Coors Light more than doubled in Mexico and Latin America on top of strong growth last year, and volume grew significantly in India.", "Now I'll turn it over to Gavin to give second quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the balance of 2014. Gavin, over to you.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Thanks, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors' second quarter underlying after-tax earnings increased 7.9% to $292.7 million or $1.57 per share, driven by improved financial results in the U.S. and Europe, along with lower interest expenses. We also increased margins versus a year ago. Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 0.9% due to lower volume in the U.S., Canada and Europe, partially offset by higher volume in International. More than half of the worldwide volume decline in the quarter was attributable to the loss of the Modelo brands in Canada this year.", "In the second quarter, our U.S. GAAP after-tax income from continuing operations increased 9.5% to $290.7 million due to positive business performance and lower special and other non-core net charges this year. Special and other non-core items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "Now I'll provide an overview of our results with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionately consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business.", "On this basis, total company net sales increased 1.5% from the prior year, driven by positive pricing and mix, which were partially offset by lower volume. On a per-hectoliter basis, net sales increased 2.1% due to higher pricing and mix in the U.S. and Canada, as well as positive geographic mix in Europe. Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.1% due to higher costs in the U.S., largely due to mix impacts, and in Europe, due to foreign exchange, partially offset by lower costs in Canada and International. Total company underlying gross margin was 42.2%, 60 basis points higher than a year ago, primarily due to gross margin expansion in the U.S. and Europe.", "Underlying marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3%, driven by Europe, the U.S. and International. Underlying operating margin was 17.3%, 40 basis points higher than a year ago due to margin improvement in the U.S., Europe and International.", "Our underlying EBITDA was $476.2 million in the second quarter, 4% higher than a year ago, driven by improvements in the U.S. and Europe. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "As I have mentioned on previous calls, we have discontinued sales curve accounting for our marketing and sales expense beginning in 2014. This change has no effect on the total amount of annual marketing and sales spending reported, but it does affect the quarterly timing of this expense. Because this change has been presented retrospectively, we have recost prior periods to reflect the new treatment.", "Elimination of sales curve accounting has the effect of increasing the previously reported second quarter 2013 MG&A expense by $15.2 million, which was offset in the second half of the year. The specific 2013 quarterly impacts are posted on our website.", "Underlying free cash flow for the first half of 2014 totaled $332 million. This $34 million decrease was driven by higher working capital versus last year, which was partially offset by higher net income. As we mentioned previously, on our fourth quarter earnings call, we do not expect to replicate the tremendous reduction in working capital we achieved in 2013. We plan to reduce working capital over time, but not at the same rate as last year.", "Our first half 2014 free cash flow included the following factors: $576 million of operating cash flow and $50 million of net deductions, mainly $63 million of cash received for the accelerated termination of the Modelo joint venture in Canada, which was partially offset by cash used for restructuring activities. Investing cash flows included $126 million of capital spending.", "Our underlying free cash flow included $692 million of cash distributions and $764 million of cash invested in MillerCoors, along with $4 million of positive adjustments for special charges and investments in businesses.", "Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.66 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $506 million, resulting in net debt of $3.15 billion, which is $301 million lower than at the beginning of the second quarter and $612 million lower than a year ago. In 2014 guidance, we are raising our full year guidance for underlying free cash flow and lowering our guidance for capital spending and consolidated interest expense. We are increasing our 2014 underlying free cash flow target to $775 million plus or minus 10%, up from $700 million, largely due to lower expected cash taxes, capital spending and cash interest.", "We are reducing our capital spending guidance to approximately $315 million, which is $15 million lower than our previous outlook. This is the result of continued focus on the effective use of our cash, including ingraining the pack model in all meaningful capital allocation decisions. We also anticipate 2014 consolidated net interest expense of approximately $135 million, down from $145 million previously, as we reduced our cost of borrowing more than planned, coupled with our improved cash flow outlook.", "All other full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter, such that we expect to fund benefit pension expense of approximately $35 million and cash contributions of $60 million to $90 million, including our 42% share of MillerCoors expense in cash, Corporate MG&A expense of approximately $110 million, and we anticipate our 2014 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 16% and near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% next year, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlements of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "In 2014 cost outlook in local currency, we continue to expect MillerCoors Canada and International cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low single-digit rate for the full year and Europe to decrease at a low single-digit rate.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. Overall, our strategy of building our core and above-premium brands and driving sales through our innovation pipeline continues to deliver results. In the U.S., we are executing our strategy to migrate our portfolio to the high end, bringing consumers exciting new innovations and Craft brands that satisfy consumers' thirst for authenticity, new flavors and styles. We will be developing new creative for Coors Light and changing all the Miller Lite packaging and signage to the original white design that has worked so well on the can. We will also launch and support Redd's Wicked Ale.", "We will continue with our business transformation initiative, which will provide the strong foundation for growth in future years. As a result, we expect MG&A expenses to be higher in the second half and the full year 2014 versus 2013.", "In Canada, we have more retail channel and in-case promotional activity for Coors Light this summer, and our latest Molson Canadian advertising is working well, with the beer-fridge campaign continuing to exceed expectations. We have a strong innovation pipeline led by the expansion of Coors Banquet, which was introduced into the Qu\u00e9bec market at the end of July, along with recent rollouts of Mad Jack Apple Ale, Molson Canadian Cider and Molson Canadian 67 Tangerine to new markets.", "Looking to the second half of this year, we anticipate that the termination of our arrangement with Modelo brands will continue to significantly impact our comparative STR and profit performance as we will be cycling equity earnings and administrative cost recoveries totaling CAD 6 million in the third quarter of 2013 and CAD 4.4 million in the fourth quarter.", "Other expected headwinds in the second half include the August 1 Qu\u00e9bec excise tax increase, the impact of cycling unusually low incentive compensation expense in the third quarter of 2013 and unfavorable foreign currency versus last year.", "Our Europe business was disproportionately affected by the flooding in the region in the second quarter, and based on what we see today, we expect the aftermarket of the floods to impact our volume and profit for at least the balance of the year. We also anticipate less benefit from overhead cost reductions in the second half.", "Despite weather challenges and weak consumer demand in Central Europe, our team continues to improve our brand health and sales execution across Europe, and we anticipate a return to positive market share performance in the second half.", "For the remainder of 2014, our International business plans to continue to drive strong growth in Coors Light, expand key brands in selected markets and make additional progress towards its goal of achieving profitability by 2016. Across all of our businesses, we anticipate higher brand investment in the second half of 2014 versus last year.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. In the U.S. for July, STRs decreased mid-single-digits -- at a mid-single-digit rate. In Canada, they were down low single-digits in July. Excluding the Modelo brands last year, our Canada STRs in July increased at a low single-digit rate. Our July sales volume in Europe decreased at a mid-single-digit rate, and our International sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a double-digit rate. As ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "So to summarize our discussion today, in the second quarter, we increased underlying after-tax income nearly 8%, grew underlying EBITDA 4% and expanded gross operating and after-tax margins. Underlying earnings per share increased nearly 7% versus a year ago. We also achieved positive pricing and mix resulting in higher net sales in the quarter.", "The fundamentals of our business are strong and improving. We have leading brand positions in the world's most profitable beer markets. We are improving the efficiency of our operations. We are successfully combining our distribution missile [ph] with our proven ability to grow both large and small brands. We have accomplished this through strong and consistent execution of our brand-led profit growth strategy and our continued commitment to Profit After Capital Charge as drivers of total shareholder return. This strategy is generating steady growing pre-tax profit, a strong and increasing EBITDA and strong cash returns to shareholders and will have an even greater impact as market conditions continue to improve.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a few quick comments. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also at 2 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "Additionally, in the next few months, we hope to see many of you at 2 events. First, as I mentioned at the start, Gavin, Mark and I will attend the Barclay's Back-To-School Consumer Conference on Thursday, September 4, 2014, in Boston. Second, our company will host -- will cohost a MillerCoors regional seminar with SABMiller in New York on December 3, and in London on December 5. And we will share additional details when we are closer to these events.", "So at this point, Chrissy, could we please open it up to questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And best of luck to you, Peter, and congratulations, Mark.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thank you, Judy.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So first, just maybe looking at the Canada trends. It looks like the underlying volume performance has been improving if you look at the second quarter and maybe through July. So maybe if you could talk about the industry conditions, what you're seeing in the marketplace, the competitive dynamics, as well as the -- if you can talk about the Qu\u00e9bec excise tax and any of -- if any pricing has been taken in that market?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Thanks, Judy. Yes, I will let Stewart answer on the detail of that. Don't forget, we do have the benefit of Easter in the second quarter this year as a comparison to last year, so that does help some of the sequential benefit. But overall, yes, things are going in the right direction. But Stewart, can you pick up the detail?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, absolutely. I mean, Judy, in truth, I don't think we've seen anything dramatic change in the Canadian environment. We did see the benefit of Easter, as Peter said, just from a timing perspective, and we saw volumes, particularly strong in the West, which enjoyed some better weather. So I can't say that I have seen anything that is dramatically different in the environment. Having said that, to pick up on your question about Qu\u00e9bec, that tax increase went into effect this week. It's a fairly sizable increase of about 26% increase in tax, similar to what we saw in -- at the end of 2012. And we do expect that to be negative, but we'll have to see what happens over the rest of the quarter. Just, you asked also I guess about industry conditions or competitive dynamics across Canada. I would say that overall, the market continues to be very competitive. Discounting was most pronounced in Qu\u00e9bec, where we saw aggressive discounting in the independent off-premise and in the value segment. And in BC, the mainstream segment moved pricing closer to value. As a result, we saw a slowdown in value in that market. Responding to those market conditions year-to-date, we've carefully managed our portfolio to drive revenue ahead of cost and to ensure appropriate returns for our promotional investments. Sometimes, that has led to some choice of share versus profit.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe just -- if I can just follow up on the more of the profitability part of the question on Canada. So in second quarter, FX neutral profit was down 1.6%. Can you just parse out for us how much was the impact on the -- from the loss of Modelo brands? Maybe quantify how much marketing was down? And I'm just really trying to gauge the underlying lower [ph] profit performance?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Okay. So a couple of things there. So first of all, we called out the Modelo impact as $18 million for the year, which is roughly $12 million through COGS and about $6 million through G&A. Specific to the second quarter, that was roughly around $7 million with the same kind of split, so that just helped you parse that number. Obviously, the impact in Q1 was much less. We haven't given any specific numbers to marketing, but what I would do is pick up on Peter's comments last quarter where he was clear that we are going to continue to invest behind our brands, continue to spend no less than we have spent. And I think if you looked at Canada on that basis, we called out that we've underspent in the first half of the year and therefore, there will be some catch-up in the second half, with most of that coming in the third quarter.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, just Gavin, maybe I can ask you about capital allocation in the context of your free cash flow coming in better-than-expected this year. You're continuing to delever the balance sheet. So any thoughts in terms of perhaps accelerating the timing of maybe increasing the cash returned to shareholders?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Judy, thanks. I mean, we obviously are targeting to reduce our stock -- leverage ratios to the sort of StarBev pre-acquisition levels. And as I said, Judy, in New York in June, we do plan to get there by early next year. And when we get there, obviously, share buybacks comes back on to the table in terms of our capital allocation strategy, which as you know, we've been very consistent about for a long time now, returning this cash to the shareholders through the dividends. We did increase our dividend 16%, as you know, at the beginning of the year. And share buybacks continue to strengthen our balance sheet and growth opportunities, either investing behind the brands we have got or bolt-on M&A. More than that, I really can't add at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A few questions on Europe. You obviously flagged the weather effect previously. I just want to know whether you were able to quantify what that meant in this quarter and how much it might mean in the rest of the year in terms of negative impact? Secondly, in terms of pricing across Central Europe, I know that [ph] the positive pricing you have got in Q2 seems to be more around mix. What's happening to underlying pricing within the Central Europe markets? Is that deteriorating as a result of softer volumes? And the third question was I noticed that there are some one-offs, I think $1.8 million related to some one-offs, related to the flooding. What are those? And though, again, do we expect more in the second half there?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, thanks, Ian. Mark, I think you might as well just jump in and take all of those, if that's okay?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Quite a number of questions in there. Let's -- so let me try and work my way through them. Obviously, from a weather impact perspective, what we've seen is really a split in Europe with Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania, in particular, plus Bosnia, really having a tough time as we've gone through the second quarter. And we've seen pretty much high single-digit to low double-digit industry declines as measured by Nielsen. So a real just kind of softness from a consumer demand perspective, whereas, the Western part of our business, so Czech, Hungary and the U.K. has been more buoyant. So some of the floods have a pretty material impact in overall demand across a number of our markets, and that has continued as you've seen from our July volume numbers into the first few weeks of the third quarter. How that's going to play out through the balance of this year? My perspective on the weather is not something I have a high degree of confidence in, but I think it's fair to say that certainly, the countries that were badly impacted by flooding were Bosnia and Serbia, in particular. We'll continue to see a real drag on consumer demand, and I think the response from the governments there will really be the tell-tale in terms of how quickly those countries recover as we leave 2014 and go into 2015. And I have to say I think our recovery plans and the response in those countries has been first class. And we're back up and operating, but clearly, it's had a pretty significant consumer impact. In terms of overall pricing, we [indiscernible] our pricing by country or by groups of country within European. So I mean, you've seen the pricing numbers that we've talked to. Just overall, we've seen pricing up by just under a couple of percent, excluding FX. And mix has driven, I think, part of that, up nearly 3%, and the net pricing after discounting was down by 0.8%. So as we've seen softer demand, certainly some of the promotional pressure in some of the markets has increased. And clearly, we're trying to protect our position. So we would be far more reactive than proactive in relation to promotional pressure in the markets [ph]. In terms of the one-off, that's principally accelerated depreciation of some of the assets that were destroyed in the flood. So hopefully, there will be no more of that to come as we go through the third quarter, and that really won't affect underlying earnings going forward. I think those where the 3 buckets of questions that you referred to, but forgive me if I've missed anything.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "No, that's a great answer. Just one quick follow-up. Is there any update on the dispute with SAB on the distribution in Canada?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "[indiscernible] we have -- we -- there is a court date set for the end of the autumn, and that's really where we are.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And Peter, I want to offer my congratulations as well on your retirement. So I guess, first question, just related to your forward outlook and some of the comments you made, I just want to make sure I tie them together. What's truly, I guess, incremental to the way what we would have been thinking or the way we would have been modeling, I think, is that interest expense is down and that we're looking at the tax rate being at the lower end. Free cash flow is also going to be a little bit better because the CapEx is down. But the comment in terms of brand investments in the second half, comping the loss of the Modelo brands, those things are all sort of -- would have been known to you and to us before the quarter. So maybe the only thing that was really incrementally more negative is just the disruption in Croatia and Bosnia. Am I my thinking about that correctly?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes, I think you probably summed it up. I'm sure there are some other -- some things at the margin. But generally, if I try and encapsulate where we are, Bryan, you're right. We've taken specific actions through the treasury function to improve our interest expense that certain positions in tax have changed and therefore, we're at the lower end. Free cash, obviously, is looking good, and there's a direct link between those 2 and then a reduction in our capital expenditure. Our marketing investment, as you outlined, it's always difficult to get the precise timing on this depending on how creative comes through. We will be skewed much more towards the third quarter this year. So that will impact our earnings then, and you are fully aware with the Modelo impact and the benefit that we got in terms of the cash for that. So I think overall, the business is very much on a steady even keel and has been -- as has been highlighted, I think, by the mix element of our NSR, we're very comfortable with the way the portfolio is moving to above-premium, which gives us a buffer against having to take pricing and also gives us a real buffer against discounting in markets where things get difficult.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just as a follow-up on -- just on Coors Light in Canada, and maybe Stewart, could you just talk a bit about the efforts or the actions that are going to be -- are being taken to turn the brand around, so in terms of the new copy? And I guess, maybe some more merchandising or promotional activity, just has -- was any of that in effect in the second quarter, or is that something that we'll really see more pronounced in the third quarter? And I'm just trying to get a sense for whether we should look at the Coors Light performance so far year-to-date as having had any real -- having been affected at all by some of the changes you're making?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, look, Bryan, I think we did see some benefit in the second quarter. I mean, Coors Light had a better quarter. We increased news. We had more offers. We had better in-store execution. And as a result, we saw Coors Light volume decrease low single-digits. Having said that, the performance is still not satisfactory. It's still losing share of beer. So there's more work to be done. And as I shared at our Investor Day, the elements of focus for us are more brand news, better in-store execution and better marketing execution. And so it's that last piece, I think, where a lot of our effort is focused for the moment on, the next round of copy that we hope to make even better than the last.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Bryan, sorry, just -- if I can just add to that. While I don't let Stewart off the hook on this one, we do need to get Coors Light where he said. If you -- I mean, Coors Banquet does have a cannibalization effect on Coors Light to some extent, and if you put both of those brands together, we are actually -- the volume actually is growing at mid-single -- sorry, low single-digits.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Thank you very much, Chrissy, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I look forward to seeing those of you who are going to be there at -- in Boston at the beginning of September.

With me on the call this morning are Gavin Hattersley, Molson Coors' CFO; Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Molson Coors Canada; Mark Hunter, CEO of Molson Coors Europe; Kandy Anand, CEO of Molson Coors International; Sam Walker, Molson Coors' Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, Molson Coors' Controller; Dave Dunnewald, Molson Coors' VP of Investor Relations, and I'm delighted to say that our Chairman, Pete Coors, has -- is also joining us today. On the call today, Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our third quarter 2014 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective in the final quarter of 2014.", "In the third quarter, our underlying after tax income decreased 2.7% and underlying EBITDA declined 2.5%. While we continue to expand gross margins and generate substantial cash, the underlying results were impacted by negative foreign currency movements, increased marketing spending and the loss of the Modelo business in Canada, partially offset by the release of a reserve following the favorable resolution of a regulatory matter in Europe, all of which accounted for a combined $22 million negative pretax impact to the quarter.", "Despite these headwinds, we continued to strengthen our brand portfolio, deliver value-added innovation, grow our share of above premium, implement common processes and focus on profit after capital charge as the key driver of our cash and capital allocation strategy. However, on a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported a pretax loss due to a $360 million impairment of the Jelen and O\u017eujsko, 2 of our brands in Europe. The largest markets for these brands are Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia, where 2 primary factors drove the impairments: first, weak consumer demand, which we expect to be exacerbated by the long-term impact of the severe flooding in May; and second, the growth of the low-price value segment.", "In the third quarter, Coors Light global volume, including our proportional percentage of MillerCoors volumes, decreased approximately 1% versus a year ago due to underperformance in Canada and the U.S., and we are implementing plans to reverse the trends in these markets. Meanwhile, Coors Light grew more than 15% in the United Kingdom and much faster in Latin America, and Coors Banquet grew share in both U.S. and Canada.", "Volume for Carling, the #1 brand in the United Kingdom, declined in the quarter, as we cycled unusually warm weather a year ago and felt the after-effects of some aggressive World Cup competitive pricing noted in the second quarter. Our Carling and the overall share trends in the United Kingdom improved in the second quarter to the third quarter. And we still expect to see overall share growth in the second half of the year.", "Our Europe above-premium portfolio continued to grow strongly, led by Coors Light and Doom Bar. Staropramen volume in Central Europe, outside of the Czech Republic, also continued its growth trajectory, and additionally, the brand achieved strong growth in the international markets of Germany and the United Kingdom.", "In the U.S., pretax earnings increased nearly 3% in the quarter, driven by positive pricing, sales mix and cost savings. The U.S. business has not recovered as quickly as we had hoped, but we were able to grow our above-premium brands. Premium and Premium Light beers continue to underperform the overall market, but Miller Lite held share of its segment on the strength of its Original Lite package redesign, which now extends to Canada's bottles, aluminum pints and secondary packaging.", "In Canada, our termination of the distribution rights to the Modelo brands early this year drove more than 2/3 of the decrease in constant currency earnings in the third quarter. During the quarter, we've also resolved our dispute with SABMiller regarding the Miller brands in Canada. As a consequence, we will no longer distribute these brands after March next year. In above premium, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth, as did our Creemore craft brand. The combined Coors Light and Banquet brand family grew market share from a year ago. Canada financial results also benefited from substantial cost savings, higher net pricing and positive mix versus a year ago.", "Our Europe business grew earnings, despite the ongoing negative impacts of the floods in Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia earlier in the year. Industry volume was down 6%, with the floods occurring in some of our highest share Europe markets, therefore, just proportionately affecting our business. Nonetheless, our overall share declined only slightly in the quarter, and we grew share in Croatia, Romania and Hungary. On a year-to-date basis, our Europe business has held share, despite the impact of the floods.", "Our International business continued improving its top line performance by growing volume and net sales of double-digit rates in the quarter. Coors Light continued to grow at strong double-digit rates in Latin America, and volume more than doubled in India.", "Now I'll turn it over to Gavin to give third quarter financial highlights and a perspective on the fourth quarter. Gavin?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Thank you, Peter, and hello, everybody. Molson Coors' third quarter underlying after tax earnings decreased 2.7% to $271.5 million or $1.46 per share, driven by lower volume, a double-digit increase in brand investments, unfavorable foreign currency movements and a higher underlying effective tax rate. Our underlying pretax income in constant currency increased 0.7% due to improved financial performance in the U.S. and Europe as well as lower underlying corporate interests.", "Worldwide beer volume for Molson Coors decreased 3.4% due to lower volume in the U.S., Canada and Europe, partially offset by double-digit growth in international. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we posted a $35.7 million net loss from continuing operations, attributable to MCBC due to special charges related to the impairment of intangible brand assets in Europe. Special and other noncore items are described in detail in this morning's earnings release.", "Now I'll provide an overview of our results, with MillerCoors presented as if it were proportionally consolidated. This is a non-GAAP approach, but we believe it provides a useful view of some key performance metrics for our business. On this basis, total company net sales increased 0.2% from the prior year, driven by positive pricing and mix, which were largely offset by lower volume. On a per hectoliter basis, net sales increased 2.7% due to higher pricing and mix in the United States and Canada as well as positive geographic mix in Europe.", "Underlying cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 2.6% due to higher costs in Europe and the U.S., largely due to mix impacts, partially offset by lower costs in Canada due to foreign currency and international due to mix. Total company underlying gross margin was unchanged at 41.6%, as U.S. and Canada margins improved and Europe and international gross margins declined from a year ago. Underlying marketing, general and administrative expenses increased 0.9%, driven by Canada, international and the U.S., partially offset by Europe. Underlying operating margin was 18.1%, 10 basis points lower than a year ago, due to lower operating margins in Canada and international. Our underlying EBITDA was $469.2 million in the third quarter, 2.5% lower than a year ago, driven by the lower earnings in Canada and higher foreign currency losses in corporate. Year-to-date underlying EBITDA of $1.2 billion represents an increase of 4.2% versus a year ago. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "As I have mentioned on previous calls, we have discontinued sales curve accounting for our marketing and sales expense, beginning in 2014. This change has no effect on the total amount of annual marketing and sales spending reported, but it does affect the quarterly timing of this expense. The business changes being presented retrospectively, we have recast prior periods to reflect the new treatment. The elimination of sales curve accounting has the effect of decreasing the previously reported third quarter 2013 MG&A expense by $17 million, which was offset in the first half of the year. The specific 2013 quarterly impacts are posted on our website.", "Underlying free cash flow for the first 3 quarters of 2014 totaled $766.1 million. This $19.3 million increase was driven by higher net cash distributions from MillerCoors and lower cash paid for pension contributions, capital spending and interest versus last year, which were partially offset by our lower working capital benefit. Our year-to-date 2014 free cash flow included the following factors: $1.06 billion of operating cash flow and $55 million of net deductions, mainly $63 million of cash received for the accelerated termination of the Modelo joint venture in Canada, which was partially offset by cash used for restructuring activities.", "Investing cash flows included $196 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $1.05 billion of cash distributions and $1.1 billion of cash invested in MillerCoors, along with $5 million of positive adjustments from MillerCoors' cash payments for special charges and investments in businesses.", "Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.45 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $722 million, resulting in net debt of $2.73 billion, which is $422 million lower than at the beginning of the third quarter and $753 million lower than a year ago.", "Our 2014 guidance is unchanged from last quarter in the following 6 areas. Although we are not changing our 2014 underlying free cash flow target of $775 million, plus or minus 10%, we currently expect our result for the year to be in the upper half of this range, that is between $775 million and $850 million. Our capital spending guidance is approximately $315 million. Consolidated net interest expense is approximately $135 million. We expect defined benefit pension expense of approximately $35 million and cash contributions of $60 million to $90 million, including our 42% share of MillerCoors expense and cash. Corporate MG&A expense of approximately $110 million, and we anticipate our 2014 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 16% and the other low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% next year, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "In 2014, regional cost outlook in local currency, we now expect international cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease in a mid-single-digit rate for the full year, driven by geographic mix and foreign currency movements. Previous guidance was for a low single-digit increase. We continue to expect MillerCoors and Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase to the low single-digit rate for the full year and Europe to decrease with a low single-digit rate.", "So at this point, I'll turn it back over to Peter for outlook, wrap-up and the Q&A. Peter?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Gavin. We continue to drive our strategy of building our core and above-premium brands and increasing sales for our innovation pipeline. In the U.S., we continue to migrate our portfolio to the high end, and new launches, like Redd's Wicked Apple, are helping to drive positive mix and an NSR per hectoliter growth.", "We're in the process of changing all the primary and secondary packaging on Miller Lite to the Original white look that has worked so well on the can. And by early 2015, we will extend the redesign to every consumer touch point. Coors Light saw a new creative in the period, which brought the breadth of brand closer to the Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment proposition. We are continuing with our business transformation initiative, and we expect this initiative, combined with brand investments, to drive significantly higher MG&A expense in the fourth quarter versus 2013.", "Looking to the fourth quarter in Canada, the termination of our arrangement for the Modelo brands will continue to negatively impact our comparative profit performance by approximately USD 4 million. In core brands, Molson Canadian is now loading out the next chapter of the Beer Fridge campaign, which leverages our NHL partnership. Early in 2015, Coors Light will see more retail activity and new advertising as part of our effort to turn around our largest brand.", "In above-premium, consumer demand remained strong for Coors Banquet, recently relaunched Molson Canadian Cider and newly launched Mad Jack Apple Lager. During the third quarter, we agreed to extend our partnership for the marketing and distribution of the Heineken and Strong Brew brands. And starting in January, we will also be selling the rest of their top-end import brands, including Dos Equis, Tecate, Sol, Moretti and Desperados.", "In Europe, in the fourth quarter, we will be increasing market investment to further strengthen our share position. Carling is being supported with heavyweight advertising like consumer promotional activity. Coors Light will be concluding its successful advertising-led ice bar activity. The Sharp's portfolio will continue to be expanded through new beer styles and Jelen will be supported by the launch of a new creative platform in Serbia. Despite weak consumer demand in Central Europe, our team continues to improve our brand health and sales execution.", "Our International business plans continue to invest to drive strong growth and make additional progress towards its goal of achieving profitability by 2016.", "In the fourth quarter, across all of our businesses, we anticipate higher brand investments in local currency. And at today's rates, foreign currency will be a significant headwind, primarily in Canada.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the fourth quarter. In the U.S. to October 25, STRs decreased to the low single-digit rate. In Canada, for all of October, they were up high single digits. Excluding the Modelo brands last year, our Canada STRs in October increased a low double-digit rate due to our switch to the Gregorian calendar, which includes 3 more days in the period this year versus last year. Our October sales volume in Europe increased at a high single-digit rate, primarily due to the change in the Gregorian calendar in the U.K. On our international sales volume, including royalty volume, increased to the double-digit rate. As ever, please keep in mind these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "To summarize our discussion today, our third quarter results were impacted by weak consumer demand in our core markets, higher marketing spending, the loss of the Modelo brand's income Canada and unfavorable foreign currency movements. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we also had the impairment of the Jelen and O\u017eujsko brands in Europe. Despite these headwinds, we continue to build a stronger brand portfolio, deliver value-added innovation, invest in our core brands and increase our share of the premium.", "We remain focused on the fundamentals of our business. We have leading brand position in the world's most profitable beer markets. We are improving the efficiency of our operations, and we are successfully combining our distribution muscle with our proven ability to innovate and grow both large and small brands. This strategy is delivering expanded gross margins, positive pricing and sales mix and cost reduction, along with steady, strong underlying EBITDA and cash returns to shareholders.", "On a more personal note, with my retirement at the end of the year, I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. It's been my great pleasure over the past 6.5 years to lead the team here and to get to know all of you. As I wrap up my final earnings conference call, I want to assure you that my transfer of leadership to Mark is progressing smoothly, and I'm confident that he and the team here will continue to drive our growth strategy and our path model through the organization, all with a goal of enhancing long-term shareholder value.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "So at this point, Jonah, we'd like to open it up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I guess, my first question is just a little bit more color around Canada. It looks like the year-to-date volume, obviously, was relatively weak, but if you exclude the profit impact from the loss of Modelo business, it looks like your profit eggs [ph] is actually trending more positively. So I just wanted to understand how sustainable that is. It also looks like price mix was up 3% in the third quarter, which was also better than what we've seen. So can you just also talk about what's driving that improvement? And then the October number, I know there's a timing change with the Gregorian calendar. But just -- it also looks like maybe it's a better number than what we've seen, even adjusting for that calendar change. So can you just talk about the October performance in the context of what we've been seeing in Canada?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Judy, I'll give Stewart a bit of thinking time, and yes, he makes a note of all those questions. But just generally, I think as far as Canada is concerned and the whole business is concerned, I mean, what you're seeing, I think, is just a continuum of what we've experienced here in Europe. Overall, nothing much has changed in the macro environment. But as we signaled in Canada, I think there's a number of things we are doing in the revenue management space, in the cost savings space. But overall, the market remains much the same, as we've experienced for the first half. Stewart, do you want to pick up the detail on the -- on Judy's questions?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, sure. Thanks, Peter. So Judy, yes, look, looking at the third quarter, I mean, the biggest impact on the quarter was, as you cite, Modelo. If you remove Modelo, then the factors that really contributed to the negative were much higher spending around marketing in Q3. We called that out last quarter. And that's just due to phasing during the year, and that would've been also overcoming higher-than-expected -- oh, sorry, lower-than-normal incentive comp in Q3 of last year. So I'd say, yes, overall, results were positive. I think what we were most pleased about was the results at the gross margin line. Having said that, we still face the volume challenge, and that is the area that we're faced in our business. And in terms of your point about sustainability, volume will be important for us looking ahead. From a price mix perspective, very positive quarter, about half of that was driven by price and about half by mix, and with respect to October volumes, if you strip out the extra days, then the trends aren't dramatically different than they were in the third quarter. Does that help?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That helps. On the price mix side, Stewart, just -- I know you've made some efforts in introducing some of the products in the high end. But just any granularity in terms of that 3% sort of price-mix combination? How sustainable is that piece?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, I mean, I'll just tell you the drivers of mix. I'm not going to comment on what the future looks like, but the drivers of the positive mix have been our driving harder against the above-premium space. That's the strategy for our company and that is something that, of course, we are driving harder in Canada. Second of all, we have been focused around our revenue management and have been pretty clearly focused on the returns of various promotions. So the combination of those things is what's driven the positives. Having said that, I mean, the environment, as a whole, is still very competitive.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then I guess, Gavin, just the free cash flow generation clearly coming in at the high end of your expectation, wanted to just get your view on the timing in which you get to sort of your leverage target. I think before, you said, by year-end this year or early next year. It seems like maybe that timing is getting a little bit expedited. And then just in the context of thinking about capital allocation, I know we've asked this question in the past. But with the stock price having run up year-to-date, how do you think about sort of cash return versus investing in the business versus acquisition? Just any thoughts on any changes to that strategy.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Well, the short answer to your last question, Judy, is no, no changes to the way we look at capital allocation. We will continue to look at returning cash to our shareholders. We will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and we'll continue to look to invest behind growth opportunities, specifically behind our global brands. So no, that won't change. What I did say in New York and I think I said it again in Boston was that we expect to get back to our StarBev pre-acquisition leverage ratios in the earlier part of next year. And at that point in time, obviously, share buybacks come back on to the table as a consideration set, and we'll make whatever decisions we think are in the best interest of our shareholders as we go along.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "All I would add to that, Judy, is whatever decisions we make will go through our path model, and that will drive the consideration as to how we allocate our capital.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Steib - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Can I switch to the U.S., perhaps? In the press release this morning, you highlighted higher expenses relating to the business transformation initiative. I wonder if you could give us a bit more background on your initiatives there and also whether these expenses were higher than what you had initially planned. And then following on from the earlier question, do you see any opportunities in the U.S. to pursue sort of bolt-on acquisitions in the above-premium segment? Clearly, your biggest competitor there is doing exactly that.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I'll let Tom pick up on the detail. But as far as business transformation is concerned, obviously, we're not going to talk in detail about how much expenditure we've got in the fourth quarter. Just to say that this is a program that's already been in the organization for a couple of years. It's driven out significant cost savings. We do have a lot of money to spend on infrastructure, specifically systems, and you're seeing the beginning of that coming through in the fourth quarter. But Tom, do you want to talk to the detail of business transformation and also the last question on the above premium?", "Tom Long", "Yes. Thank you, Peter. So you really hit the question. That portion of business transformation that has increased and will also increase in the fourth quarter is around systems of business process and systems. These are systems investments that we have planned, and now those expenses are coming through. Not much more to say on that. In terms of bolt-on acquisitions, it's very true that many craft brewers are on the market right now and increasingly so, and we're very engaged in a number of those discussions. We're actively looking at those that would create incremental shareholder value, but it's also no secret that those valuations are extremely high right now.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Thanks, Tom. And again, just to reemphasize on that. I mean, we have, as you know, over the years, had some very successful bolt-on acquisitions, such as Doom Bar and Cobra and Creemore and so on. But the same -- we'll use the same discipline as we talked, that Gavin talked about earlier in terms of capital allocation. If we can't get a return that we want on any acquisition, big or small, then we will not undertake it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Wanted to follow up on the European business and sort of trying to decipher the geographic mix, as you look at the better performance in the U.K. relative to Central Europe and how much -- what's the real sort of pricing environment look like in these markets? And how long do you think you'll continue to benefit from that mix benefit as we look at the -- some of the structural problems involved with the Central and Eastern European business?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "All right, okay. Well, I'll pass it on to Mark in a minute. But just as a headline, we don't deconstruct the yield of business by country, so we can't go into that detail. But Mark, do you want to give an overall flavor about pricing?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Sure. I mean, I think what I would do is probably contextualize this with just the summary through the third quarter overall. Sluggish industry demand, we saw across all of the markets that we operate in. Consumers really kind of contracting from a spend perspective. So all markets were negative from an industry shipment perspective. What we are seeing is, within many of the markets, a shift from core and premium towards the value segment, which I think we've already called out in relation to a couple of our markets in particular. We've had the benefit of the U.K. performing strongly that, again, we've flagged in a couple of our quarterly reports. But beyond that, I think the pricing environment will be linked very directly to the pace of economic recovery within Europe. And I think everybody in the call will be aware that Europe has got some pretty fundamental macro challenges. As we see those improve over time, then I think the pricing environment will improve.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Great. And if I can just ask a follow-up on the -- to Judy's question on the Canada piece, related to the calendar shift. From high single digits, let's say, down to sort of like mid-singles, that's a pretty big percentage gap for 3 days. So can you just sort of help us with the math? And when did those 3 days -- I apologize for not knowing this, when did those 3 days sort of come out?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "So John, in terms of when the specific days come out, I'd to go back to the calendar, have a look. Maybe Dave can pick that up in the follow-up. I can't give you too much detail on the calculation, only to say that I've had the benefit of seeing all the numbers. And I can just tell you that the trends in total don't look dramatically different than what we saw in Q3. So that's really the best advice I can give to you.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I think you're just going to have to trust us on that one. If you look at the like-for-like comparison, shaking out the extra days and you take out the Modelo volume, then Canada is down low single digits.", "John A. Faucher - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, great. But I mean, wouldn't that be better than Q3?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Well, just -- I mean, look, roughly here, if you got 28 days last year and you got 3 extra days this year, I mean better than 10% right there, so rough order of magnitude, but stick with my guns.", "David Dunnewald", "Yes. I think what you're looking -- this is Dave Dunnewald. John, I think what you're looking at is a straight reported STR number in the third quarter for Canada was down 5.9%. That's not what Stewart's talking about. He's saying if you look at more of an apples-to-apples view in the third quarter, then take out the Modelo brands, in other words, you'd be down at a low single-digit rate and that's what we're -- we are also seeing low single-digits on an apples-to-apples basis in October.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "The brand write-offs that you've announced today in Europe, I guess the question is around that. I mean, firstly, why now? I think traditionally, we tend to have these things more at the end of the year. But also, does that mean that all the other brand in StarBev, you're pretty happy with in terms of the carrying value in brands and goodwill?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "So I'll let Gavin speak to the timing, Ian. But yes, I think your assessment is pretty much spot on. Obviously, we've not taken impairment on the overall business, so that would indicate that there's a balancing factor here. We do have a specific issue with Jelen, to a lesser extent, O\u017eujsko. It has been driven, as I said in the script, by generally weak consumer demand, which everyone is aware of. That has moved consumers towards value brands, so it's impacted on -- in that way. And also, the floods really have hit overall volume. And we try to make an assessment of what that impact will be going forward as well, so we thought it judicious, if you like, to make sure that we put those impairments into the books now. What I would say is that if you look at both brands within their category and you look at brand health -- excuse me, the brand health of O\u017eujsko is extremely strong, and it's gaining market share in its category. And Jelen, equally, with the new advertising that would be coming out in the -- in this -- the end of this year, brand health looks healthy. But the overall macro environment is such that we thought it the right thing to do to take an impairment on the brands. Gavin, do you want to?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Yes, Ian, we are required to test up goodwill and brand values on an annual basis, and we do that as at the 1st of July, beginning of our third quarter. So we have tested all our brands. We've tested our -- we've tested Europe and Canada, and these are the 2 brands that required an impairment, based on their testing.", "Ian Shackleton - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Good. And just a quick follow-up, I think in your update for the guidance for full year on inputs and COGS, I'm not sure you mentioned the U.S. Is there any change in thinking there?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "No, there was no change in the thinking on the U.S. And again, it was increased low single-digits last year -- last quarter, and it's remained at increasing low single digits.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Peter, I'm sure the thing you're going to miss most when you step down is just taking all of our questions.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I will miss it immensely, Bryan.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, in terms of the price mix in Europe, I'm assuming -- I'm inferring from your comments that most of the benefit in price per hectoliter was mix and there really wasn't much rate. Is that right?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "That's correct.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then can you give us an update or a progress report, I guess, on the turnaround of -- or re-acceleration efforts for Coors Light in Canada? I'm not sure if you mentioned where -- what Coors Light volumes were in the quarter. But just trying to get a sense for how you've progressed in that turnaround.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes. Again, I'll let Stewart give you the detail in a second. But the reality is that we looked at getting new creative in for the third quarter and what we came up with wasn't satisfactory. So we've had to go back to the drawing board on the creative. We're determined to get it right. That new creative will be hitting the streets in the beginning of 2015. So we've had a bit of a hiatus, if you like, in terms of our plans. But Stewart, do you want to talk specifically about the third quarter?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes, sure, Peter. I mean, Bryan, if you look to the third quarter, Coors Light was down mid-single digits. Peter summarized it in exactly the right way. And we had 2 problems of -- one was a big, emotional connection, be creative with our consumers and our in-store execution. I think the second part, the in-store execution, we've got that well in hand now. The creative appears to be going in the right direction. And probably the third thing to just think about here is that there is a cannibalization impact from Coors Banquet, which is now a national distribution. If you took Coors Banquet and Coors Light as a combined set of brands, then those 2, in total, help share in the quarter. So more work to be done in Coors Light, but Coors Banquet, performing very well.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So with the creative not being where you were looking for, does it mean that you actually spent less on Coors Light media than you would've even ordinarily spent?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "No. I mean, we kept our creative -- we have enough creative materials to use. We've used some of our functional advertising around vented can, for example. So no, the answer is we haven't substantially changed that.", "Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one last one related to Canada. It just -- the overall industry, just how does your adjusted volume performance compared to the industry growth rate? I wasn't sure if you had given an industry growth rate.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "So we lost just under 0.5 share point in the quarter.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Industry was down 1.7, Bryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "We don't get a lot of chance to ask Peter Coors questions, so I hope this is all right. I was just wondering if, perhaps, you could give your big picture perspective on the company, on the beer industry, how -- and how you see yourself positioned in the industry and what you're most excited about. I know that's kind of very broad and very loose, but just wanted to get your general thoughts and the kind of message you'd like to get out there.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Yes. Rob, in fairness to Pete, he literally has just dropped in, so I don't think it's fair dropping that question on him. But I think that the view of the market, that the view of the industry is as we -- you and I have talked about on many occasions. I don't think there's much more to add on that.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "Okay. Well, I'll ask a much more mundane question then. And pardon me, if I missed this earlier on. I think you called out a reversal of a reserve in Europe, can you give us any details on that and the size of it.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Sure.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Rob, it's Gavin here. There was a provision that we recorded when we bought StarBev in 2009, and this was regards to a regulatory review that we recorded as liability upon acquisition. During the third quarter, we were excluded from that, filing the reports, and so we released the full reserve. And if you look at the decrease in Europe MG&A, which was around $11 million, it accounted for roughly half of that.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "So $5 million to $6 million?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Yes, roughly half.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Andrew Holland with SG.", "Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "I was actually also going to ask about that reversal. I think we've now got the size of it. Can you just tell us what the nature of it was, please?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "No, we don't get into the detail of regulatory issues that we have on a country-by-country basis. Suffice to say, we've resolved the issue. The reserve's no longer required, and we released it.", "Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Can you tell me which country it related to?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "No, we don't get into that level of detail.", "Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "Okay. Let me try this one. Your -- just looking at the results of the international division, the size of the losses. Just again, the 9-month figure slightly less than it was this time last year, but it looks as if it's still going to be negative for the full year. Can you give us an idea of when you might hope for your international division to breakeven, please?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "I'll let can Kandy talk about the specifics in the third quarter, but it's the -- any small movement in expenditure really affects the quarter disproportionally, because it's such a small business. But Andrew, we've been pretty clear over the last few years that we expect this division to breakeven. It should be in profit by 2016. Kandy, do you want to talk specifically about the third quarter impacts?", "Krishnan Anand", "Sure. So Andrew, in the third quarter, we've -- we're actually quite pleased both quarter and year-to-date performance. As you see, our top line has grown 20% plus, specifically Coors Light has grown extremely strong, double digits. And the difference in just the third quarter, essentially because of increased marketing spend, as we're driving [ph] that top line growth. The International businesses continues to be well on track to deliver the commitment that Peter just said, which is to be breakeven and in profit by 2016.", "Andrew Holland - Societe Generale Cross Asset Research", "And is that going to require you to rethink your marketing support then? Because there's quite a big gap between what the run rate is now and what breakeven would imply.", "Krishnan Anand", "No. I don't think it'll require us to rethink. I think the main thing is our top line grows 20%. It enables us -- if you look at our gross profit, that's also growing in line with our top line. So that enables us to continue to bridge that gap.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Tristan Van Strien from Deutsche Bank.", "Tristan Van Strien - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Two questions, if I may. The first one is on your Latin American performance, which was pretty good. Can you just give us a bit of color on that and how things are going in Mexico and if you entered any new markets in that region? And the second thing is -- second question. I guess, you solved the issue in Canada with SABMiller. How secure do you feel your JV in the U.K. with Grolsch? And do you feel that is in danger at all in the coming year or so?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Right. Well, I'll let Kandy answer the question on Latin America in a second. As far as the issue with Grolsch is concerned, no, we have total control of that brand in the U.K. It's not a JV. It's a different setup altogether. So whatever happens with the brand largely is down to -- is up to us. So it's well within our limit as to what happens with it. Kandy, do you want to talk about Latin America?", "Krishnan Anand", "Sure. So we're excited with the progress of Coors Light in Mexico, in Central America and in the Caribbean, which are the main markets that we are in. This is based on continued impact over the last couple of years of our Rocky Mountain Core Refreshment positioning, working with our partners to execute brilliantly in the markets as well as a lot of in-store efforts, which truly makes the brand disruptive. In terms of your question on the new markets, the only new market we have in 2014 versus 2013, which is up significant, is Australia, which we added, really, end of December last year. So it's been the first 8 months, and we're extremely pleased right now with the progress on Coors Light. As you recall, Coors there for legal reasons so far with our partner, Coca-Cola Amatil, over there.", "Tristan Van Strien - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Just while you're on the line, in terms of India, your growth in Coors Light, is that mostly in Bihar state or you've expanded that as well?", "Krishnan Anand", "In India, we don't have Coors Light. We have local brands. It's the local brands. And our business, as mentioned in Peter's comments, has doubled. But we are basically in Bihar. We export a couple of states, but essentially 90 plus percent of our business is in Bihar.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "A couple questions. Firstly, Gavin, just a clarification, if you can, on share repo. Any sense of when you might actually communicate with us on that, given that you're going to be at that low leverage level early next year?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Mark, I'm going to give Gavin a rest, because I think he's fed up of answering these questions. No disrespect to you, but we really can't tell you anything more than we've told you. We'll talk to our board as to how we allocate our capital. It's an ongoing conversation. We'll decide the best allocation between bolt-on acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase. But it is on the agenda. We've been clear about that. And when we got a decision to announce, I promise you'll be the first to know.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "Fair enough. Fair enough, okay. And then a question on Canada, and I don't know, Stewart, if perhaps you're the person. But can you update us on the sector side to look at the cost structure. Obviously, you're not going to give us a number, but just how that exercise is going? And when might we hear of you on the potential for incremental savings in that market?", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Stewart, you probably are the right person to answer the question on Canada. But just in terms of incremental savings, I mean, what we flagged are the 2 -- we've given you an overall cost-savings target for the business and we said that we'll be in the high end of that in the first couple of years and that takes into account what we planned to do in Canada. But Stewart, do you want to give a progress report?", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. Look, that makes a lot of the sense, Peter. Yes, Mark, I mean, the cost -- our cost -- the program is going well, that we've been attacking both the aspects of our supply chain and COGS, and at the same time, we've been pushing very harder on our MG&A. And I think if you run some benchmarks on us versus competitors, you'll start to see that showing up in our results. So it's really all the detail I can give you, other than to say, we've got a team that's actively focused on it and delivering results.", "Mark D. Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division", "My understanding is the $40 million to $60 million for the total company includes a certain view for Canada. But with your new leadership there, Stewart, there's potential to add to that number as you look at the structure. Is that a fair understanding?", "David Dunnewald", "Mark, if I could take that, our guidance that we've been fairly consistent on since June of last year in New York was $40 million to $60 million for the next 4 years or so, with us being at the top end of that for the first 1 or 2 years, as Peter said. Last year, a lot of those cost savings came out of Europe. For the next 1 to 2 years, most of those cost savings are going to come out of Canada. So everything that Stewart is doing is in that guidance number we've given you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters.", "Peter S. Swinburn", "Okay. Well, thank you very much, everybody. You'll have the pleasure of listening to Mark and exit the exercise for the fourth quarter, and I'm sure he will give you a much more cogent and better answers than I've been able to do for the last 6.5 years. Thank you very much, everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company\u2019s Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to the most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.", "The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the Company\u2019s executives in discussing the company\u2019s performance, please visit the company\u2019s website www.molsoncoors.com and click on the financial reporting tab of the investor relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.", "Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in U.S. Dollars.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Thank you, Leann. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call and many thanks for joining us today. With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors we have Gavin Hattersley, our CFO; Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox our newly appointed CEO of Europe, congratulations Simon. Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, VP of Investor Relations, and we also have Tom Long, CEO of MillerCoors with us. And congratulations Tom and best wishes for your retirement announced earlier today.", "On the call today Gavin and I will take you through highlights of our full-year and fourth quarter 2014 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspectives on 2015. Overall, 2014 was a good year for Molson Coors. We grew net sales in constant currency and gross margin, as well as underlying EBITDA, free cash flow, after-tax income and earnings per share.", "Weak consumer demand continued across our largest markets, but we made good progress in building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positions, and increasing our share in above premium. We also continued to improve our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increase the efficiency of our operations, implement common systems and focus importantly on Profit After Capital Charge as the key driver for our cash and capital allocation strategy.", "In performance headlines for the year, we delivered $1.47 billion of underlying EBITDA and $768.5 million of underlying after-tax income, or $4.13 per diluted share. After-tax income grew 5.7% from a year ago. Excluding foreign currency movements and the termination of the Modelo joint venture in Canada, all of our businesses achieved improved underlying profit performance in 2014 versus the year before.", "We drove working capital performance company-wide and achieved $957 million of underlying free cash flow, which exceeded our original 2014 free cash flow goal by more than $250 million and we expanded our PACC model deeper into our company, including adding this measure to our long-term incentive plan.", "We over-delivered against our cost savings targets, and we reduced our net debt by nearly $800 million. We grew our global above-premium volume, net pricing and sales mix, and maintained market share in Europe despite a poor economy and really challenging floods in some of our highest-share markets.", "Volume challenges included Coors Light performance in the U.S. and Canada, however, Coors Light worldwide volume grew nearly 2% on the strength of its performance in Europe and International. We also cycled the termination of the Modelo brands joint venture in Canada.", "Despite these challenges, our overall profit and cash performance helped to drive a positive total shareholder return of 35.7% in 2014, which is more than two-and-a-half times the total return for the S&P500 index of large stocks last year.", "Based on this performance and our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders, we also announced board approval today for a new four-year, $1 billion stock repurchase program and an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend. With this change, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 156% since 2007.", "Now, regional highlights for 2014 are as follows. In the U.S. underlying pretax earnings increased nearly 3%, driven by positive pricing, sales mix and cost savings. We grew revenue per hectoliter and increased our percent of sales in above premium, while working to restore growth to Coors Light and Miller Lite.", "Miller Lite returned to growth in the fourth quarter with a total brand overhaul and redesign focusing on the brand\u2019s authenticity and heritage, and Coors Banquet grew volume for the eighth consecutive year. We also continued to grow the Above Premium segment with higher-margin offerings, notably Redd\u2019s, Blue Moon Belgian White and Leinenkugel\u2019s Summer Shandy. Brand innovations designed to drive margin improvement included Miller Fortune, Smith & Forge Hard Cider, Redd\u2019s Wicked Apple, and Coors Light Summer Brew.", "Our Canada underlying earnings declined 7.1% due to unfavorable foreign currency movements and the impact of terminating our Modelo joint venture early in the year, which had a combined negative profit impact of approximately $35 million. Canada sales to retail, or STRs, declined 4.7%, with more than half of this decline due to the loss of the Modelo brands.", "Molson Canadian gained share in its segment, and the combined Coors Banquet and Coors Light brand family grew Canada market share versus 2013. In above-premium, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth in 2014, as did our Creemore craft brand, and we expanded Molson Canadian Cider and extended our partnership for the marketing and distribution of the Heineken and Strongbow brands.", "Margin-enhancing innovations included introducing Mad Jack Apple Lager and new craft flavor extensions for Canada\u2019s consumers. During the year, our Canada team drove positive pricing and sales mix, achieved significant cost savings, and invested strongly in improving the efficiency of our brewery network.", "Our Europe business in 2014 delivered higher net sales and gross margins, along with double-digit underlying pretax earnings growth. We worked against a weak economy all year, and severe flooding in some of our highest-share markets in early summer clearly compounded the challenges.", "Nonetheless, we maintained market share across the region on the strength of our core brands, or above-premium portfolio and innovation. Our craft and above-premium brands performed well, with Coors Light, Doom Bar, Cobra, and Staropramen outside the Czech Republic leading growth. And innovations during the year included Carling British Cider, new craft beer launches, and cold-activated packaging across multiple markets.", "Our International business delivered double-digit growth in volume, net sales and gross profit in 2014, despite the continuing challenges in Ukraine and Russia. Coors Light volume in Latin America continued to grow at a strong double-digit rate, and we recently launched Coors Light in Chile and Coors 1873 in select Latin American markets. In India, we grew volume at a double-digit rate and increased our market share. As a result of strong topline growth and cost control, we reduced the underlying international loss by 17.9% versus 2013.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Gavin to give fourth quarter financial highlights and perspective on 2015. Gavin over to you.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody. In fourth quarter financial highlights Molson Coors net sales were down approximately 5% in the U.S. dollars entirely due to foreign currency. Constant-currency net sales grew nearly 1% from the strength of positive and sales mix globally along with higher volume in Europe and international. Worldwide beer volume from Molson Coors decreased 1.3% due to lower volume in the U.S. and Canada partially offset by growth in Europe and international.", "Underlying after tax income decreased 21% to $102.1 million or $0.55 per share. Our underlying pretax income also decreased 21% with approximately one-third of this change driven by unfavorable foreign currency and the balance due to increased brand investments and incentive compensation this year along with lower volume in the United States and Canada and the termination of our Modelo brands agreement in Canada.", "Foreign currency had a negative $11 million or 31% impact on pretax income in the quarter. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors Brewing company of $93.2 million which is 31.9% lower than in the prior year due to a higher effective tax rate and favorable foreign currency, low worldwide volume and increase brand investments.", "Our underlying EBITDA was $273.9 million in the fourth quarter 14.6% lower than a year ago driven by lower earnings in the United States, Canada and Europe, please see the earning release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter. In the area of cost savings we exceeded our 2014 goals by achieving more than $70 million of cost reductions across our company driven by Canada and Europe.", "These results exclude Molson Coors which provided another $60 million of cost savings in 2014 at our 42% ownership rate. We expect cp0st savings over the next few years to be in our medium term range of $40 million to $60 million and come primarily from Canada, with diminished savings from Europe. We also successfully concluded our three year working capital initiatives with a total improvement of $378 million since 2012, which is $78 million above our original target. We drove working capital lower by $66 million, $253 million and $59 million for 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively.", "We intend to continue to push hard on working capital in the years ahead to generate free cash flow. We are also pleased that we exceeded our underlying free cash flow goal for 2014 by generating a total of $957 million of free cash an increase of $65 million or 7.3% versus 2013. Higher underlying free cash flow was driven by increased distributions from Molson Coors in higher underlying income as well as lower cash paid for pension contributions, capital expenditures, interest and taxes.", "These improvements were partially offset by a decreased benefit from changes in net working capital. Our 2014 free cash flow included the following factors, $1.27 billion of operating cash flow, and $56 million of net deductions, mainly cash received for the accelerated termination of the Heineken contract brewing agreement in the United Kingdon and the Modelo joint venture and Miller brands agreement in Canada, which were partially offset by cash used for restructuring activities.", "Investing cash outflows included, $260 million of capital spending. Our cash flows to and from MillerCoors were broadly neutral. A detailed reconciliation of our 2014 underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release this morning.", "Total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $3.187 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $625 million, resulting in net debt of $2.562 billion, which is $171 million lower than at the beginning of the fourth quarter and $796 million lower than a year ago.", "During the past several years, we have used our cash not only for growth opportunities, but also to continue to strengthen the Company\u2019s balance sheet and to more than double our dividends per share. The combination of strong cash generation and significant debt reduction now gives us the opportunity to increase returns to shareholders through a stock repurchase program.", "Our board has approved a new program to repurchase up to $1 billion of the Company\u2019s Class A and Class B Common shares, which we expect to implement over the next four years. We anticipate that the stock repurchases will be weighted toward the last two years of the program. This new stock buyback program reflects our continued confidence in the long-term growth and cash generating potential of our Company, as well as our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders.", "Also, our board has authorized another increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.37 per share to $0.41 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2015. This 11% increase results in an annual dividend amount of $1.64 per share, which represents a payout ratio of 20.6% of 2014 underlying EBITDA.", "We continue to target a dividend payout in the range of 18% to 22% of trailing underlying EBITDA, which we anticipate will keep our dividend in a competitive range for global beer companies for the foreseeable future. With the buyback and dividend announcements today, we are pleased to be in a strong position to increase cash returns to Molson Coors shareholders, while preserving financial flexibility to explore growth opportunities and meet our pension obligations in the future.", "As always, potential cash uses will be vetted by our disciplined process, including our PACC model, and must meet our firm criteria of providing a clear view to near-term earnings accretion and building long-term shareholder value.", "Looking forward to 2015, our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $550 million, plus or minus 10% at January 31 foreign currency rates. This goal is $407 million lower than our 2014 result because of five primary factors. Our strong push on working capital had better results than expected in 2014, including from MillerCoors, and some of these improvements were originally expected to be achieved in 2015.", "Second, some of our large customers paid invoices early, which we were not expecting and are unlikely to repeat. At current rates, we expect foreign currency to be a significant headwind for both cash and profit generation in 2015. More on this in a few minutes from Mark.", "We anticipate increasing capital investment behind cost savings projects and innovation to drive future growth, profit and improved volumes. And finally, increased cash tax payments as we continue to move toward a cash tax rate closer to our normalized effective tax rate.", "Over the two-year period of 2014 and 2015, we expect to deliver more than $1.5 billion in underlying free cash flow, which averages at the top end of our original cash guidance range for last year.", "Currently, we expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million in 2015, up from $75 million last year, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions. This increase is primarily due to an additional voluntary contribution of approximately $230 million we made early this year to our U.K. pension plan, as well as moderately higher contributions to the Canada and MillerCoors plans. We do plan to exclude the additional U.K. contribution from our underlying free cash flow calculation, as we have done in the past.", "Meanwhile, we anticipate 2015 pension expense of approximately $27 million, down slightly from $32 million last year. Note that all of these pension numbers include our 42% of MillerCoors. The overall funded status of our defined-benefit pension plans, again including MillerCoors, declined about 2 percentage points from a year ago to 90% at the end of 2014. This decrease was driven by lower year-end interest rates and longer life expectancies for pensioners versus a year ago.", "Our 2015 capital spending outlook is approximately $330 million, up from $291 million last year, primarily due to planned supply chain capital projects in Canada and keg purchases in Europe.", "We expect our 2015 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $110 million. Our consolidated net interest expense outlook for 2015 is approximately $120 million. We expect our 2015 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "We continue to expect our long-term tax rate to be in a range of 20% to 24%. As far as our cost outlook is concerned in the U.S., we expect MillerCoors cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a low-single-digit rate for the full-year 2015. In Canada, we expect our 2015 COGS to increase at a mid-single-digit rate per hectoliter in local currency.", "In Europe, we anticipate a mid-single-digit decrease in cost of good sold per hectoliter this year in local currency, and our International business anticipates a low-double-digit decrease primarily due to changes in geographic mix and foreign currency. In each of our businesses, we anticipate higher costs related to product and package innovation.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Thanks, Gavin. In 2015, we will continue to drive our strategy of building a stronger brand portfolio that is delivering value-added innovation, or strengthening our core brand positions, and increasing our share in above premium, craft and cider. We will do this while ensuring that we have a fit for purpose cost base and a deeply embedded, PACC-led capital allocation approach.", "Through 2015 and beyond, I will additionally be leading for a relentless focus on delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the First Choice brewer in the geographies and segments where we choose to play.", "2015 will, however, throw a number of challenges our way. For nearly a year, we have flagged for you that we expect our effective tax rate to be higher than last year. We also anticipate substantial profit and cash headwinds from foreign currency and the termination of three business contracts this year.", "To provide a sense of our FX challenge, if we were to apply foreign exchange rates at the end of last month to our 2014 results, it would reduce last year\u2019s underlying pretax earnings by more than $70 million, or approximately 8% and the impact on cash would have been even larger.", "Our 2015 financial results will also be negatively affected in the U.K. by the termination of our Modelo distribution agreement and termination of our contract brewing arrangement with Heineken at the end of April. In Canada, we are terminating our Miller brands agreement at the end of March. We expect the loss of these three contracts to present a pretax profit headwind this year totaling approximately $40 million.", "We are taking actions to lessen the impact of losing these income streams, including the proposed closure of our Alton brewery to adjust our U.K. cost base to reflect the loss of the Heineken contract volume, along with the addition of the Femsa brands to our business in Canada and adding the Modelo brands in Central Europe.", "Regionally in the U.S., job number 1 is to drive for share in American Light Lagers, making sure consumers know the rich heritage behind Miller Lite and the cold-filtered Rocky Mountain refreshment of Coors Light. In 2014, we returned Miller Lite to growth in the fourth quarter with a total brand overhaul and redesign focusing on the brands authenticity and heritage. In 2015 we will bring the same focus and intensity to returning Coors Light to growth by restaging the brand while maintaining our core messaging round Rocky Mountain Refreshment.", "In addition, we\u2019ll continue to transform our portfolio to above premium with innovations like Redd's, Smith & Forge Hard Cider and further extensions Leinenkugel's and Blue Moon such as our new Blue Moon White IPA. We will continue to build first choice customer partnerships working with our distributors to bring more resources to the on premise with our building with beer retail strategy, which leverages a higher velocity and broad appeal of American Light Lagers. Overall, we will invest significantly on our brands and information technology and as a result we do not expect to grow our U.S. operating margins in 2015.", "The Canada market remains weaker than U.S. and our team will continue to invest in supply chain efficiency and capability to streamline our Canada cost base. In core brands Molson Canadian just introduced the next chapter of its Beer Fridge campaign and Coors Light will see more retail programming and new advertising later this quarter. And above premium consumer demand remains strong for Coors Banquet, Molson Canadian Cider and Mad Jack Apple Lager.", "Last month, we began the national launch of Coors Altitude, a 6.4% ABV lager that is a refreshing alternative to spirits. This year, we also plan to introduce Rickard\u2019s Radler as a seasonal. In addition to Heineken and Strongbow, we are now marketing and distributing the rest of Heineken\u2019s top-end import brands in Canada, including Dos Equis, Tecate, Sol, Moretti and Desperados.", "The Europe economy continues to struggle with weak overall consumer demand and a deflationary backdrop and we expect the ongoing growth of the value segment and lower margin channels and PACC configurations to be challenges again in 2015. Our segment leading core brands such as Carling, Ozujsko and Jelen will continue to be heavily invested in 2015 while we continue the strong momentum of our above premium craft in cider portfolio.", "We are also adding the Modelo to our international premium brand portfolio in Central Europe this year, but volume for these brands is currently much smaller than annualized volume of the brands that we are loosing in the UK. Our international business will focus on growth and expansion in new and existing markets. We will continue to drive strong momentum on Coors Light and Coors 1873 in Latin America along with growth in our India business. At the same time, we will remain disciplined with our cost base as we move towards our goal of achieving profitability by 2016.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our business season very early in the first quarter. In the U.S. through January STRs decreased at a low-single digit rate. In Canada for January, they were down high-single digits. However, excluding the Modelo brands last year, our Canada STRs in January decreased at a mid-single-digit rate.", "Our January sales volume in Europe decreased at a low-double-digit rate. Excluding the Modelo brand volume in the U.K. last year, our volumes in Europe decreased at a high-single-digit rate primarily due to weak post-holiday sales in the U.K.", "Our International sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a mid-single-digit rate. As ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead.", "So to summarize our discussion today, we achieved good results in 2014 and built a stronger business. We grew underlying earnings and margins, and we exceeded our goals for cost savings, cash generation and debt pay-down, despite significant headwinds during the year.", "And, based on our continued confidence in the long-term growth and cash generating potential of our Company, as well as our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders, we announced a double-digit increase in our quarterly dividend, along with a new stock repurchase program.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via web cast on our website.", "So, at this point Leann, we would like to open it up for questions please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Judy E. Hong", "Thank you, hi, everyone.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Hi, Judy.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Hi, Judy.", "Judy E. Hong", "So, Gavin maybe starting with your free cash flow guidance for 2015 if we just look at your two year average for last two years 7.50 it still looks like it\u2019s a step down in terms of 200 million I know you talked about some other factors that are driving the decline, but can you also just quantify really the bigger headwinds that\u2019s you faced the decline in terms of year-over-year from free cash flow guidance perspective.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Okay thanks Judy, I will just pass that straight across to Gavin. Gavin, do you want to take that one.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Sure, hi, Judy. Yes I think if you want to compare the run rate as you say it\u2019s on average about $750 million for the two years. I guess the biggest item that wasn\u2019t there in 2014 or 2015 will be the foreign exchange headwinds that we all experiencing Judy. Mark did reference that in his prepared remarks, from a profit of view if you\u2019re using January 31 rates that would be around $70 million and from a cash point of view that\u2019s slightly higher.", "So that\u2019s probably the biggest headwind and then I would say the second one is our desire to increase our capital investments behind some cost savings incentives primarily in Canada, but also innovation and as I\u2019ve said Keg purchases in Europe. So and then I guess the third item would be increased tax payments, as our cash tax rate moves closer to our normalized effective tax rates. So I would say those are the three biggest items if you comparing the ongoing run rate with the past.", "Judy E. Hong", "Okay. And then within that complex as we think about your new buyback announcement up to a $1 billion over four-year period, obviously encouraging to see you are returning more cash to shareholders. At the same time I think you\u2019ve commented that the buyback will be more backend loaded. So can you just give us some perspective on the timing of the buyback whether it\u2019s because of the free cash flow guidance for this year or are there any M&A opportunities in terms of looking at the pipeline that you want to preserve some of that financial flexibility?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Hi, Judy its Mark here. I mean I think just as context to the buyback I\u2019d direct you back to the really the guidance and the philosophy we have around use of cash within the business and we\u2019ve said that certainly as an executive team and as a board we want to strike the right balance across three critical priorities. So we\u2019ll continue to strengthen our balance sheet and further reduce liabilities, clearly we have some pension liabilities that we need to deal with as we go through 2015.", "We\u2019ll focus on returning cash to shareholders and we want to remain open to brand led growth opportunities. So I think what we\u2019re attempting to do is strike the right balance here and the phasing of the buyback I think reflects only to retain that balance, I don\u2019t know Gavin whether you\u2019d want to anything to that.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Yes, Judy the only thing is I would add to that is our guidance for 2015 on free cash flow is $550 million, little over $300 million of that is going for cash dividends. And I did reference the special pension contribution we made to the UK, which is obviously taking place in 2015, in fact it\u2019s really taking place and a net amount to about $230 million.", "Judy E. Hong", "Got it, okay. And then just quick last question, you cited higher incentive compensation expenses in the corporate line to be in the fourth quarter end, just wanted to see if you can quantify how much the increase was?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Not quantifying specifically that, Judy, but I\u2019d also start some negativity in foreign exchange in the fourth quarter for the corporate division is being a driver for the increase there.", "Judy E. Hong", "Got it. Okay, thank you.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "In fact foreign exchange was the larger driver in the fourth quarter for corporate.", "Judy E. Hong", "Understood. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is open.", "Vivien Azer", "Hi, good morning.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Hi, Vivien", "Vivien Azer", "Hi, I apologize I was not on the 9 a.m. call, so I was hoping the first half of question on MillerCoors. If you could also a little bit more color on the deceleration that you saw for the above-premium segment please in the quarter?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Sure, I think we have Tom on the line, Tom are you with us this morning.", "Tom Long", "Yes, I\u2019m here Mark.", "Mark R. Hunter", "And do you want to just pick-up and talk about our ongoing ambition to continue to move our portfolio in an above-premium direction and really just reflect a little bit on the short-term Q4 performance.", "Tom Long", "Yes, thank you. So the Tenth and Blake division which is a big portion of our above-premium business did declined low single-digits in Q4 it\u2019s primarily due to declines in strategically deprioritize brands like Kelly and Batch 19 and Q4 growth in Leinenkugel Shandy did not offset that and that\u2019s cyclical and that's behind us. The very important strategy of transitioning our portfolio continuously year-after-year until the above-premiums remains intact and we had pretty good numbers of 14.9% of our businesses now and above-premium was up 1.2 percentage points last year.", "So that continues and we\u2019ve got a terrific portfolio of innovation for this year including Blue Moon or Horchata, Blue Moon Wide IPA, Leinenkugel\u2019s, cranberry ginger and IPL as well as more innovation on Red\u2019s in March we are launching Red\u2019s green apple which has been a terrific innovation at very high margin. So that strategy remains intact and we look forward to advancing in 2015.", "Vivien Azer", "Terrific Tom, thank you so much and congrats on the retirement. My second question has to do with Europe, clearly the investments that you made paid off from a volume perspective, so as we think about 2015, was an incredibly volatile macro backdrop continuing to present potential headwinds, how should we think about the balance between volume growth and profitability please?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Thanks, Vivien it\u2019s Mark here again I\u2019ll hand over to Simon just in a second I think it\u2019s fair to say that certainly the economic challenges in Europe that we are looking into in 2015 are not unusual and not very different to what we\u2019ve been dealing with over the course of the last 18 months to 24 months and our business is working very, very hard to make sure that we continue to manage our cost base very effectively and we drive our portfolio in a more premium direction so that if pricing is difficult are challenging in Europe that we get a positive mixed impact. Simon do you want to add any color to that?", "Simon Cox", "Yes, I think you hit the headlines there Mark. As was referenced we\u2019ve got a good track record I think between bouncing volume growth and profitability, so if you look back through 2014, I think the trend in 2015 in terms of the market demand of the consumer will be very similar and we\u2019ve shown an ability to withstand that. So highlights for 2014, I point to star a prominent growth at some of the Chez Republic in a premium position product.", "We\u2019ve done well with above premium products like Coors Light, Doom Bar and Cobra in the UK which helps our mix in our revenues and we\u2019ve done well on things from our own innovation, so Carling, British cider from the UK and Cherry cider across Europe and some of our craft launches in some of our cold packaging.", "So when we manage that portfolio well, investing behind the premium brands and our core brands we're able to despite a difficult consumer backdrop quite elegantly navigate that volume \u2013 the growth and profitability mix. So we would be confident that we can do that again, but I would certainly point to the 2014 results as evidenced.", "Vivien Azer", "Thank you so much. It\u2019s very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is opened.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "Hey good morning everyone.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Hi Bryan. Good morning.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "Just a couple of I guess really points of clarification and then a question. First, in terms of the free cash flow guidance, does that include \u2013 that\u2019s inclusive or net of the pension contribution as well?", "Mark R. Hunter", "No Bryan that\u2019s before the pension contribution, so.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "Okay. Okay, and then in terms of Coors Light and I guess a couple of questions related to Canada. Did you actually mention what Coors Light did in the fourth quarter, I might have missed that.", "Mark R. Hunter", "I don\u2019t think we did mention. Stewart do you want to touch on the Coors Light performance in Q4 and probably we said in the context here of the broader Coors brand family performance which you know we\u2019re very encouraged by.", "Stewart F. Glendinning", "Yes. So thanks for that Mark Coors Light actually had - very much better Q4, brand was down a couple of percent, but on a sequential basis performance was much, much better. If you took Coors Light and Banquet together those brands were flat so a good result for the Coors family in total.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "Stewart can we read into that. I know there has been a lot of considerable amount of focus trying to restage the Coors Light brand in Canada and so can we read into this that there has been some transaction in terms of some of the actions you have take to get Coors Light restabilize or back to growth or on a path to growth.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Well, I think we\u2019ve done good things with both Coors Banquet and with Coors Light. There is more work to be done with Coors Light as we shared during the prepared remarks, we expect to see our new campaign release later this quarter. We got an action- packed 2015. And so, yes we feel good about the fourth quarter. But I think we\u2019re working hard on making sure that\u2019s that continues into this year.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "Okay. And just one last one just COGS per hectoliter in Canada being up mid single-digits on a local currency basis. Can you just walk through why I guess I thought was that it might be a little bit lower just given where some of the raw material costs are, so can you just kind of talk through some of the factors that are driving it to the mid single digit rate?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Okay, yes, look sure I mean I think that you\u2019ve got to consider where you believe the average inflation to be and then we layer on top of that any expected deleverage those would be the big drivers. Of course also we may see a little bit of FX impact as a result of U.S. denominated imports like Banquet as well as any other products we buy for out of the U.S.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "Okay, thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Right, Bryan just one additional comment\u2026", "Krishnan Anand", "Bryan I would just add to that I mean obviously that the efforts which Stewart and his team are putting behind innovation will tend to drive COGS up from a mix point of view. And then we did have MMR for Q1 of 2014. So we will feel the impact in Q1 of 2015 of not getting the cost recoveries coming through there, so those are two items I would add to Stewart.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "All right. So that\u2019s helpful there is a mix component that\u2019s driving at above and beyond just what you are paying for raw material.", "Krishnan Anand", "Correct.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Correct.", "Bryan D. Spillane", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Thanks Bryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of John Faucher from JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "John A. Faucher", "Yes, hi good morning. I know Dave is going to be doing the modeling call a little bit later. But just conceptually if we look at those two headwinds you talked about would be FX in the last contracts that adds up to about $110 million. And as we look to model this if we strip out that the MillerCoors piece, you\u2019re looking at a base probably if you have about $500 million from an operating profit.", "So it\u2019s a big slug there. How do we think about the offsets or is that something where we say with those \u2013 you are just going to have those headwinds and it just going to be tough year and you work through them. So I guess I am asking what\u2019s the big offset relative to the $110 million headwind? Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Hi, John its Mark here I mean we don\u2019t give earnings guidance as I think you are aware what we try to do is, I can give you transparency on a couple of areas, which we\u2019ll be leaning into very, very hard through this year. So I\u2019m not going to give you a sense is to the mitigation plans, but take it from me as an organization that we\u2019re lined up to continue to drive the underlying performance of the business, make sure that we invest in the business for driving value over the medium to long-term and we won\u2019t do anything that undermines the business to deflect some of those more material headwinds, other than continue to drive the performance across our brands and our cost base and I can\u2019t give you and won\u2019t give you anymore specific detail in that.", "John A. Faucher", "Okay, if I can just follow-up and I apologize because this might had come out in your answer to Bryan\u2019s question, but I just want to make sure the FX guidance is inclusive of all of the transactional pieces et cetera. So you mentioned shipping Bankwood out of the U.S. internationally. That\u2019s all inclusive in that 70 some odd million, is that correct?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "John, let me take that one. From an FX point of view the $70 million which Mark referred to is a translational impact for Molson Coors. And when you look at how the CAD is devalued since January of last year, it\u2019s around 14% and the Euro is devalued about 17% to the end of January. So in combination that\u2019s what\u2019s driving primarily the $70 million. Any FX movements that impact cost of goods sold would be included in the cost of goods sold guidance which we gave you by business unit.", "John A. Faucher", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Your line is open.", "Ian Shackleton", "Yes, good morning gentlemen. Mark, this is obviously your first call as CEO, and I also quite interested in terms of what perhaps the new approaches you see for the business that we talked about last year?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Couple of comments I mean I think if you look at our performance through 2014 in our total TSR growth, that for me underlines volatility of our existing strategy and a direction of travel of the business and all of our businesses grew underlying profit last year, when you [indiscernible] FX in the Modelo JV. So I don\u2019t think our business requires any significant adjustment and direction of travel.", "So expect going forward more of the same plus the relentless focus on really driving more of a first choice consumer and customer agenda in our origination really getting connected with what is going to take to one in all of our markets of course the consumer and a customer level.", "Look for an accelerated thought within MCI and also expect our PACC model and our PACC approach to be driven right to the front end of our business and to the short floor and that\u2019s something which is already work in progress through 2015. So very much the same course of direction, but heightened just focus on three specific areas.", "Ian Shackleton", "That\u2019s very useful thank you. Just a couple of specifics and I think in the fourth quarter you have positive price mix in Canada, does that give you confidence that would ease something more of a trend going forward?", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "I am always vary of calling any quarterly performance as a trend I think we feel very good about the progress that Stewart and his team has been making in Canada I mean both from a cost restructuring perspective and also the focus in our tough volume market really continue to drive our NSR per hectoliter. So I think the team have made continued progress through 2014 and that was again demonstrated in the final quarter. So I think in a tough volume environment we are focused in the right areas in our Canadian business.", "Ian Shackleton", "My final question was around oil and obviously this presume a little bit of benefit in some of the COGS guidance from lower oil, and but I was quickly interested around distribution cost I guess this is probably bigger issue in Europe for you but certainly in Canada, but I mean is there a benefit that we need to bare in mind for 2015?", "Mark R. Hunter", "It\u2019s already contained really within the COGS guidance that we offered Ian, so I wouldn\u2019t call as a particular material adjustment over and above the guidance that\u2019s been offered.", "Ian Shackleton", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel. Your line is open.", "Mark D. Swartzberg", "Yes, thanks good morning everyone. I guess two questions one is really a follow-up to Bryan\u2019s on the COGS you specifically for the U.S., Canada you are saying mid single-digits and again we have this favorable import environment that we don\u2019t have transactional issues here in the U.S., so can you just speak more to why the plus to single-digits is it primarily a mix things then I had a second question.", "Tom Long", "Mark, I would just say it\u2019s primarily a mix issue as they put a lot of focus on innovation. Yes that\u2019s a simple and short answer.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Yes, and Mark the offset you see it comes through on the NSR per hectoliter, so I think Tom and his team have done a really nice job again in a tough volume market of really focusing on driving the revenue link and you\u2019ll see the benefit for innovations comes through and Tracey has already mentioned guidance on NSR per hec of 2% to 4% growth. So we got to drive the innovation portfolio and that comes as normally, but a slightly hard cost at COGS level.", "Mark D. Swartzberg", "Got it. And then as we think about the way you are budgeting for 2015 versus perhaps are you budgeting few months ago, pretty soft start to the year and to John\u2019s question about in the number you have given us of about $110 million or so EBIT drag. Is it fair to think that the soft start to the year had a big influence on how you are thinking about the budget you had a few months ago?", "Mark R. Hunter", "No I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that. Our budget was coming through the fourth quarter of last year; certainly the volume numbers in the first few weeks of 2015 don\u2019t in anyway lead us to change our thinking for 2015.", "Mark D. Swartzberg", "Got it.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Mark the other thing obviously is January is a very small month for us right and its just a small part of the first quarter with February I haven\u2019t been clear on as we are continuing to drive on our cost savings programs so we are still driving on the $40 million to $60 million guidance which I gave a couple of years ago and continue to put a lot focus on that.", "Mark D. Swartzberg", "Got it.", "Got it great. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] our next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from ISI.", "Robert E. Ottenstein", "Great thank you. I guess there is a prior question on how much the incentive comp was up and you didn\u2019t want to answer that and I understand that but I was wondering if you could tell us to what degree the incentive comp is tied to cash flow generation and because the cash flow generation was so much higher than expected that was the driver for the increase in the incentive comp.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Hi Rob, it\u2019s Mark. I mean we wont go into deep, the specific details of our compensation programs, but across our business our people are rewarded for top line, bottom line in cash performance and for our senior team results are longer term component PACC, but beyond that I wont go into any specific detail other than to say that the cash element is actually the smallest element of the compensation structure. So it doesn\u2019t have an over bearing impact on the total incentive line.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "And Rob I don\u2019t know if you were on the call earlier, but I would also add to that actually the biggest part of the $6 million increase in corporate loss was related to unfavorable foreign currency movements, the lion share of it actually was.", "Robert E. Ottenstein", "Okay and a different question. In terms of Coors Light now globally, what percentage of the volume is sold outside of the U.S?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Well that\u2019s a good question. Kandy, you answer some of that?", "Krishnan Anand", "Yes. So Rob, in terms of the Coors Light sales outside the U.S. and Canada, that\u2019s your question?", "Robert E. Ottenstein", "No, no, globally, just the total Coors Light sales to the entire company, how much is U.S. - what percent of volume is U.S. and what percent is international?", "Mark R. Hunter", "That\u2019s not in our finger tips, we are just checking for you.", "Gavin D. Hattersley", "Take the 42% Robert, it still be somewhat less than 50% of the global Coors Lights sales are sold outside the U.S. that would include places in Kandy\u2019s organization, that would include Canada, a really nice growth business in the UK, yes, those are the main headlines.", "Robert E. Ottenstein", "Kandy, you had the announcement that you are going to be taking the Coors brands into Chile working with CCU on that assuming would you also be interested, you think in going into Columbia with those brands?", "Mark R. Hunter", "Yes, Rob let me pass that across to Kandy.", "Krishnan Anand", "Thanks, Rob. So overall as you know we are very pleased with our progress on Coors Light especially in Latin America the consumer, customer and our partner interest and acceptance of brand is at a high level, we\u2019ve been growing strong double-digit, we\u2019ve just launched the brand in Chile with CCU and we\u2019ve also launched Coors 1873 which part of it - it\u2019s early days are doing pretty well in the market, beyond that we are not going to give you guidance on specific markets for obvious competitive and other reasons.", "Robert E. Ottenstein", "Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Thanks, Kandy. And Rob just to come back to your specific question on the proposition of Coors Light volume outside of North America so including Canada, that\u2019s about 15% to 17%, so principally in international business and in our UK and Ireland business.", "Robert E. Ottenstein", "Thank you very much.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our presenters for closing remarks.", "Mark R. Hunter", "Okay. Thanks, Leann. And many thanks everybody for joining us this morning at Molson Coors Brewing Company. We do appreciate your time and your questions and we look forward to speaking with you on our Q1 earnings call and then seeing many of you in New York our Analyst Meeting later this year.

With me on the call this morning, we have Gavin Hattersley, CFO of Molson Coors and currently the Interim CEO of Miller Coors and from Molson Coors we have Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO, Simon Cox, our CEO for European business; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, our VP of Investor Relations.", "In the second quarter our underlying pretax earnings on a constant currency basis increased 5.9% driven by positive net pricing along with the results of cost savings initiatives.", "Due to higher tax rate and unfavorable foreign currency our underlying after-tax income decreased by 9.9%. We increased the gross margins in the U.S., Canada and Europe and grew net sales revenue for hectoliter in the U.S. and Canada in local currency. Overall Europe NSR per hectoliter declined in local currency, but if we exclude the impact of the terminated Modelo and Heineken contracts, NSR per hectoliter increased in all of our major Europe markets apart from Serbia. ", "We also expanded global underlying operating margins, driven by our U.S. and Canada businesses. In the quarter we continued to implement our strategy of driving brand-led profit growth, meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation. We have invested consistently behind our core brands, with for example Coors Light in the U.S. growing share of segment, we made progress in transforming our portfolio toward above-premium, craft and cider and we expanded the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets. And we have continued to increase our commercial capability.", "Additionally this year, we have repatriated Staropramen lager to our U.K. portfolio and purchased the Mount Shivalik Breweries business in India and the Rekorderlig cider brand distribution rights in the U.K. and Ireland. These acquisitions give us high potential platforms to grow our business in key markets. We also made a decision to substantially restructure our China business as we focused on accelerating the performance of our overall International business and we have closed our Alton brewery in the U.K. as we continue to restructure our U.K. supply chain.\" ", "Additionally, we remained resolute on utilizing PACC as our key business-decision framework, using our cash to reward investors and ensure a healthy balance sheet, reducing costs to provide front-end firepower, and placing smart bets that deliver brand-led growth opportunities. Our strategy is underpinned by highly engaged, passionate and inspired people with the ambition to be First Choice in the eyes of our consumers and our customers.", "This progress in the quarter was against the backdrop of continued volume pressure in our largest markets, significant impact from foreign currency movements, a higher tax rate, and terminations of business contracts in the U.K. and Canada, as previously communicated. ", "Other 2nd quarter performance headlines are as follows. Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 2.2% in constant currency, driven by sales mix changes within our Europe and International businesses, including the impact of terminating the Modelo brands and Heineken contract-brewing agreements in the U.K. These factors were partially offset by positive global pricing and revenue management in local currency.", "Constant currency net sales decreased 3.3% due to lower volume in Europe and Canada and negative mix in Europe and International, again partially offset by positive net pricing. And by adding in the additional effect of foreign currency, reported net sales declined 15.4%.", "Coors Light volume declined 2.3% globally, driven by declines in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by high-single-digit volume growth outside North America. Our global craft portfolio grew volume high-single digits in the quarter, and our cider portfolio grew more than 30%.", "Worldwide volume declined 1.9%, including the impact of the termination of our Miller brands agreement in Canada and the Modelo brands contract in the U.K. Underlying pretax income of $327.9 million was down 0.9% but increased 5.9% on a constant currency basis.", "Underlying after-tax income decreased 9.9%, driven by a higher tax rate, which was cycling a large discrete tax benefit a year ago, and unfavorable foreign currency. These factors were partially offset by positive net pricing and the results of cost savings initiatives.", "Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $455.3 million, a 4.4% decrease from a year ago, again due to foreign currency movements.", "Additionally, we began to implement our four year $1 billion stock buy-back program, with more than 672,000 Class B common shares repurchased in the 2nd quarter, and another $50 million of cash used early in the 3rd quarter for Class B stock repurchases.", "In terms of regional highlights, in the U.S. underlying earnings increased 8% due to lower brewing and packaging materials and fuel costs, as well as higher net pricing and supply chain cost savings. Volume was lower in a weak 2nd quarter for the U.S. beer industry. Overall, Miller Coors achieved strong financial results, along with continued progress in transforming our U.S. portfolio toward the above-premium segment. In core brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite both grew share of segment, while Coors Banquet grew volume and market share. Our Above Premium portfolio, led by Blue Moon Belgian White, Leinenkugel\u2019s and the Redd\u2019s family, grew in the quarter. ", "In Canada, underlying pretax income grew 4.3% in constant currency, due to positive pricing and mix, as well as substantial cost savings, despite the negative impact of terminating our Miller brands agreement at the end of March this year. Including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency, underlying earnings declined by 5.5%. Canada sales to retail or STRs, declined 8.1%, with the biggest individual driver being the termination of the Miller contract. ", "In core brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter, in part due to industry weakness in their highest-share regions. In above premium, Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth in the 2nd quarter, as did Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow Cider -- and we delivered double-digit growth from our Granville Island craft brands. ", "In Europe, excluding the impact of currency movements and the terminated Modelo and Heineken contracts, our Europe underlying pretax income would have increased in the 2nd quarter, driven by higher sales volume, positive pricing and lower costs. Europe business underlying income decreased 21.5% in the quarter, entirely due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency and the terminated contracts. We were pleased to see some recovery -- and higher beer volumes -- in the areas of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia that were badly affected by severe flooding a year ago. In core brands, Carling trends improved from earlier in the year, and Ozujsko and Bergenbier grew volume and segment share in their core markets. And our craft and above premium portfolio continued to perform well, with Coors Light, Doom Bar and Staropramen outside of Czech all achieving strong growth in the quarter.", "Our International business again delivered double-digit volume growth in the second quarter with triple-digit volume growth in India, due to the strong performance of our existing India business and our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries earlier this year, along with double-digit growth for Coors Light in Latin America. During the quarter, as part of our International profitability goal, we announced our decision to substantially restructure our existing China business, which resulted in the recognition of $3.6 million of price promotion expense. This additional promotional expense and unfavorable foreign currency were the primary driver of the $2.1 million increase in International's underlying pretax loss versus a year ago. These factors were partially offset by higher volume and lower marketing spending.", "Now I'll turn to over to Gavin to give additional second quarter financial highlights and perspective on the rest of 2015. Gavin? ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks, Mark and hello, everybody. In financial highlights, underlying free cash flow for the first half of 2015 totaled $241.1 million which represents a $90.6 million decrease versus the first six months of 2014. This decrease was primarily driven by a lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, including higher cash paid for taxes.", "Our first half free cash flow included the following factors, $198.1 million of operating cash flow and $248 million of net add-backs for our discretionary U.K. pension contribution in January. Miller Coors investments in businesses and the cash impact of special items. Investing cash outflows included $139.8 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $692.9 million of cash distributions from Miller Coors and $758.1 million of cash invested in Miller Coors. A detailed reconciliation of our underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release distributed this morning.", "Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.138 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $413.8 million, resulting in net debt of $2.724 billion, which is $430.4 million lower than a year ago. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results for the quarter. ", "Looking forward to the balance of 2015. The following full year forward guidance is unchanged from last quarter. Our annual target for underlying free cash flow is $550 million, plus or minus 10%, at July 31 foreign currency rates. We expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $300 million to $320 million in 2015, including our 42% of Miller Coors contributions. We anticipate 2015 pension expense of approximately $27 million, including our portion of Miller Coors. We expect capital spending to be approximately $300 million. We expect our 2015 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $110 million.", "Our consolidated net interest expense to be approximately $120 million, which is based on foreign exchange rates and hedging positions at the end of the second quarter and our 2015 underlying effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 22%. After this year, we expect our underlying tax rate to be near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% for the next few years, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions. ", "In 2015 cost outlook, we continue to expect Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase at a mid-single digit rate in local currency and International business COGS to decrease at a low double-digit range per hectoliter. Miller Coors, however, now expects 2015 cost goods sold per hectoliter to be approximately in-line with the year before versus pervious guidance of the low single-digit increase, with the change driven by lower fuel and commodity costs.", "In Europe, we now anticipate a low-single digit decrease in cost of goods sold per hectoliter this year in local currency, versus a mid-single digit decrease previously, primarily due to increased sales of higher-cost above premium brands. ", "And finally, regarding the profit and cash headwind from foreign currency that we expect this year: If we apply foreign exchange rates at the end of July to our results for the second half of 2014, it would reduce underlying pretax earnings for that period by more than $43 million -- and the impact on cash would have been even larger. By adding the foreign exchange impact on pretax results for the first half of this year, we arrive at a full-year foreign currency impact of more than $70 million versus our 2014 consolidated pretax results. We have taken steps in recent years to mitigate some of our foreign currency exposures via debt structures and hedging.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Gavin. In addition to the foreign currency headwind that Gavin just discussed, our results in the balance of this year will continue to be challenged by the termination of three major business contracts, which we anticipate will have a full-year 2015 profit impact of $40 million pretax, as well as a higher effective tax rate. Additionally and importantly, we plan to significantly step up our portfolio investments across all of our businesses. These investments will have a particularly negative impact on third quarter and overall second half bottom-line results, but we expect them to provide benefits long term, as we focus on delighting our consumers and our customers to ensure we are the first choice in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. ", "Regionally, in the U.S., we are driving a handful of priorities. Job number one is to transform our portfolio and rediscover volume growth. And to do this, we have three focus areas. Firstly, taking share and growing our American light lagers, Coors Light and Miller Lite. As part of Coors Light's overhaul, we are rolling out a contemporary visual identity across all packaging, and we have introduced new national television advertising that emphasizes Coors Light\u2019s Rocky Mountain heritage.", "Secondly, we'll continue to premiumise the portfolio and further develop Above Premium offerings that have the potential to build scale quickly and sustainably. Examples include the successful launches of Blue Moon White IPA and Leinenkugel\u2019s Grapefruit Shandy, along with the expansion of Blue Moon Cinnamon Horchata 6-packs, as well as the introduction of Leinenkugel\u2019s new seasonal release, Harvest Patch Shandy. And then thirdly, we will simplify and clarify our below-premium portfolio offering.", "Job Number Two in the US is to improve our commercial capability, including winning an on-premise and increasing the relevance of our brands in this critical channel, where brands critically are built, and finally Job Number Three is to ensure that our cost base is competitive and fit for the future.", "Consistent with our priorities, in the 2nd half of this year, we intend to invest significantly in our brands and information technology, and as a result we expect our US underlying operating margins for full-year 2015 to be relatively flat versus prior year.", "In Canada, we continue to invest in our core brands and Above Premium, including Craft, imports, cider and flavored malt beverages. For our core brands, a new ad campaign and increased focus on commercial execution on Coors Light will provide the foundation to help improve trends for our largest brand in Canada. Also, solid creative execution and integrated supporting programs for Molson Canadian, particularly related to our Anything for Hockey and Beer Fridge advertising, are starting to create a renewed bond between drinkers and our second-largest brand. In the 2nd half of this year, we plan to invest aggressively in these programs. ", "In Above Premium, the termination of the Miller brands contract will present a headwind for our business through to the 1st quarter of next year. Despite this, the strong performance of the Coors Banquet, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Rickard\u2019s Radler and Molson Canadian Cider brands are influencing the transformation of our portfolio toward the above-premium segment, and our expanded partnership for the Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol and Strongbow brands is delivering volume and share. We also recently announced that Blue Moon Belgian White, the number-one selling craft beer in the United States, is coming to Canada this month as Belgian Moon. ", "In Europe, we will cycle the terminated Modelo and Heineken contracts in the UK for the balance of this year. The Modelo brands volume represented about 1 share point in the UK for us last year. The repatriation of the Staropramen brand rights for the UK business and securing the U.K. distribution rights for Rekorderlig cider are part of the plans we said we would execute to transform our portfolio and mitigate the impact of these contract losses. Starting in 2016, we expect these two brands to add more than 350,000 hectoliters of above Premium volume annually to our Europe business and provide attractive growth potential for the future. ", "In combination with the integration of the Franciscan Well craft brands in Ireland and the acquisition of the brewing and kegging operation of Thomas Hardy\u2019s Burtonwood Brewery in England, we now have a broad range of consumer and customer offerings in the above-premium, craft and cider segments across the U.K. and Ireland. Also, we continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to ensure that these critical brands remain relevant and contemporary for our consumers. The positive momentum we are currently seeing in the Carling, Ozujsko, Bergenbier and Borsodi brands illustrates that this investment strategy is working. Additionally, we intend to explore further opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our European operations over the coming months to unlock more resources to invest in driving top-line and bottom-line growth.", "Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant-currency basis and accelerating our overall growth and expansion into new and existing markets. We will continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light and develop Coors 1873 in Latin America. We will also continue to build on Staropramen\u2019s momentum in greater Europe, recognizing that volume for this brand in the UK and Ireland will transfer at the end of this year from our International business to our Europe operation. Additionally, we will augment rapid growth in our existing India business with growth from our newly acquired Mount Shivalik Breweries operation.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the 3rd quarter. In the U.S. through July 25th, STRs decreased a low-single digit rate. In Canada through July 31th, STRs were down high-single digits, however excluding the Miller brands last year, our Canada STRs for this period decreased at a low single-digit rate. ", "In Europe in July, sales volume was up high single-digits, driven by growth in 10 out of 11 countries in the region. ", "Our International sales volume, including royalty volume, increased at a double-digit rate in July.", "As always, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. ", "So to summarize our discussion today, our 2nd quarter financial results reflect continued volume pressure in our largest markets, significant impact from foreign currency movements, a higher tax rate, and terminations of business contracts in the UK and Canada. We expect these headwinds to continue in the balance of this year, along with a significant step-up in our brand investments across all of our businesses, which we expect to negatively impact our short-term profit but provide longer-term benefits to our financial performance. Going forward, we will continue to implement our strategy of driving brand-led profit growth, meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation. Over time, we expect this strategy to help us unlock opportunities for growth in Molson Coors Brewing Company's top-line, bottom-line and long-term shareholder value.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via web cast on our Web site.", "Additionally, we hope to see many of you at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston on Thursday, September 10.", "So, at this point, Carmen, we would like to open it up for questions please. Thank you. Carmen?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question is from the line Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Judy Hong", "My first question is on Canada. So, it seems like you lost share but you\u2019re pricing and profitability was relatively healthy. So, can you just talk a little bit about your market share performance and kind of your balancing share versus profit, it sounds like may did the investments we'll step up in the back half, so would you expect the market share performance to improve and is that really more of near term priority in Canada?", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Judy. Let me offer you just a couple of comments and then Stewart can pick up on the detail. I think the encouraging thing in Canada as you mentioned is our pricing performance was strong and having now secure de-pricing performance clearly, it gives us option as we move into the second half of the year, a signal very clearly that we do intends step up the level of our commercial investments behind out portfolio. Stewart, do you want to talk about some of the priorities as we go through the second half of the year?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Sure, Mark. Look, Judy, we're not going to give any specific guidance on where we think share will end up. I think there is always a careful balance between share and the price. We've got the flexibility in the back half for being able to choose that, one area of note, I'd just point out is our conscious decision with Coors Light in Quebec in the second quarter to take the price up to match the 5% beers that's the one market in Canada, where the 4% beers have historically have been priced underneath to the 5% beers. So we sought to address, that was a really specific decision. In other parts of the country, we saw some fairly aggressive pricing and price spending and my team is looking at those tactics for the back half. ", "Judy Hong", "Okay. So would you attribute some of the market share losses to the healthy pricing and the more aggressive competition or is it sort of the ongoing challenges that you've been stating?", "Mark Hunter", "I wouldn't say that the answer that is, yes. There were placing where higher prices have translated into lower ship.", "Judy Hong", "Okay. And then Gavin just two questions for you. One is just on the U.S. and sorry, I missed the Miller Coors calls but I think one of the priorities that we're hearing more from you is just simplifying and streamlining the low premium segment and recognize that you've got a long tail there and I guess, historically some of the challenges that you've padded, just working with your distributors and making sure that you've got a plan in place. So, can you just elaborate on the plan there? And then on the financial side, the free cash flow guidance this year just remind me what\u2019s embedded in terms of the currency impact and any other kind of puts and takes that\u2019s changed since your last guidance?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Okay. So, Judy, let me take the last one first, from a free cash flow point of view, I'll just remind you that our guidance is $550 million plus or minus 10%. And we haven't been specific about the foreign exchange impact on that underlying free cash flow other than to say that the 70 million I referred to from a profit point of view, the impact from a cash point of view would be even higher than that. And if I can just remind you of some of the impacts beyond FX because obviously foreign exchange is a big part of that, but we did have our strong push on working capital in 2014, which over delivered for us and if you recall some of our larger customers paid early and then we do have a higher capital investment plans, some of the cost savings programs and we have higher cash tax payments, as our cash tax rates gets closer to our underlying tax rates. So that's really the cash flow side.", "And let me just talk my Molson Coors cap off and put the Miller Coors cap on. ", "Mark Hunter", "Below premium.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Below premium was the other question. Look I mean we all continue to lose share of industry and shares of segments in our economy brands and we are reviewing our long term strategy for these brands. We know we have the ability to win in the economy segment for example in 2014 and the first half of this year Steel Reserve has been up in mid-single digits, in large part due to the introduction of the Flavored Steel Reserve Alloy Series. So we're going to get sharper from our below premium economy segment point of view, we're going to simplify and I'm not ready to share those details publicly. We do have our full distributor meeting with our distributors coming up and we'll elaborate a little bit more then.", "Judy Hong", "Got it.", "Mark Hunter", "Judy, the only thing I would add, I mean your specific question was around the relationship with our distributors and below premium brands that job number one is for the team at Miller Coors to really clarify our below premium portfolio strategy and align that with our retailers, our distributors will then benefit from the impact of that clarity. That's a work in progress and Gavin and the team will be taking that to market in the near term.", "Judy Hong", "Got it, okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.", "Vivien Azer", "My first question has to do with your price mix realization in Europe. I recognize that there are a lot of moving pieces as some of your previous partnerships unwind, but given the change in your COGS outlook, driven by premium mix shift can you offer a little bit more color on what your price mix or price per hectoliter realization would have looked like on an underlying basis in Europe in the quarter?", "Mark Hunter", "Vivien, I'll let Simon talk to the detail, just you know from a context point, one of the things I referred to in the script was actually in local currency we saw pricing growth in a per hectoliter basis. The context in Europe as we go from local currency to Euros or from sterling to Euros and then onto dollar, so it can get a little bit complex. Simon, you want to offer just a bit more detail as to how you are reading the mix across countries and across our portfolio?", "Simon Cox", "Yes, thanks Vivien. As Mark said when you talk across 11 countries with a fair degree of movement in some of them and the impact to contract manufacturing and the loss of Modelo is complex but let me try and simplify it for you. I think the first thing to say is that pricing in this quarter overall in Europe was up 0.6%, so the negative was really the mix and again the mix comes back to the loss of the contracts. If you take those impacts away then our net sales revenue per hectoliter was up in 10 out of our 11 markets with the exception being Serbia. So overall, based on the fact that actually we did -- again if you strip out the Modelo brands grow volumes, we were quite pleased that the pricing and volume mix equation with pricing being up 0.6% and net sales revenue per hectoliter being up in 10 of the 11 markets. So overall we think our pricing was pretty solid particularly when combined with our volume performance.", "Vivien Azer", "That's very helpful.", "Mark Hunter", "And Vivien I would just now refer you back to the fact that we've seen -- certainly our volumes across a majority of our markets and through July continue to move positively. So I think the team are getting the balance right between price and volume virtually across all of our markets.", "Vivien Azer", "Absolutely, no that's great. My second question has to do with Canada and the industry backdrop, you know one of your key competitors reported earnings and actually he had characterized the Canadian market, how the industry is, having had good performance in the quarter which stands in contrast a little bit I think to the way that you guys characterize the market. So can you could offer any more context, is that just a function of relative geographic mix or is there anything underlying kind of the discrepancy in that commentary.", "Mark Hunter", "Stewart, do you want to pick that up and just give a feedback [ph] of the industry backdrop?", "Stewart Glendinning ", "I'm not sure Vivien where you saw the discrepancy, certainly we saw an industry that was healthy, in positive territory. I think from our stand point we had two things going on in our business when you look at the underlying performance. Our pricing was stronger and we certainly weren\u2019t affected by geographic mix, when you look across the country the west was much stronger than the east. And if you looked at Ontario and Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, all of those declined. Those are the provinces in which we are strongest.", "Vivien Azer", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ian Shackleton with Nomura.", "Ian Shackleton", "Yes, good morning gentlemen. Two questions, firstly in Europe, certainly the volume numbers look pretty good, I just want to know whether you could give out market shares across the major markets, I know it\u2019s a relatively easy comp to the flooding, but you do seem to have done pretty well and perhaps you can give us an idea on shares. On Canada I mean you gave us the figure of minus 8.1 and then say that half of that due to the Miller brand. Is there nothing coming back from the extended Heineken contract yet? Is that something still to come or does that have a reasonable impact, positive impact on this quarter?", "Mark Hunter", "Hi Ian, I'll ask both Simon and Stewart just to talk to the specifics. I think it's fair to say within Europe that we don't [indiscernible] into the share by country. At also Europe\u2019s level we did lose a little bit, about 0.33%, but than if you reversed out the impact of the loss of the Modelo then actually, it holds a relatively flat year on year. Simon, anything you would add to that?", "Simon Cox", "Not a lot, Mark, because as you say we don't intend to speak to that by country. If you do reverse have that in Modelo volumes and then aggregate it back up, we did actually slightly grow share across the region, which is a setting combination with what we regarded to be pretty decent pricing performance and this is what we're seeing in the market in terms of discounting, then we were pretty happy with our volume performance. So, very slight share gaining, if you reverse out the impact of losing the Modelo contracts.", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, probably the only other thing I'd add, Ian is that, in a number of markets within economy segment have grown pretty rapidly over the course of the last 12 months. And we are responding to that, but certainly not leaping to that and if we do how many share weakness anywhere it would tend to be in the economy segment, which is obviously lower margin segment. So, we're playing I think a very balanced and responsive game across the markets in Europe.", "Steward, do you want to talk about it some of the emerging tailwinds in Canada's as you look at the broader portfolio?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Yes, absolutely, I mean, Ian you asked a question about losing the Miller brands and picking up the intensive [ph] brands, certainly we've had a good start with intensive brands but they're much, much smaller than the loss of the intensive brand. So, I don\u2019t know if you want more on that, but that's sort of intensive brands are a fraction of the Miller size.", "Ian Shackleton", "So, just to be clear, these intensive brands can be quite slow, we don't want to see step up in that seeing Q3free going forward. It will be over the next few years, will it?", "Stewart Glendinning", "We think we got some really good brands and of course we know that we can grow them, but we're growing off a very small base", "Ian Shackleton", "Understood. And just quick follow up, just getting premium back for the UK, it's called a big amount, I think, you're paying there, which is quite surprise to me, but when do you actually get that back, is that come in from 2016?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes and the majority of the deal is that we get the brand back from full on the 28th of December this year. So, effectively yes, for 2016 onwards.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Ian, other thing I'd add is, as you would expect the repay interstation of the startup from a backend to the UK has been running through our PACC model and it makes absolute sense for our business on the basis of utilization of PACC based on existing arrangement and the new arrangement and with that new arrangement will open up to us in terms of the growth profile of the brand", "Ian Shackleton", "I mean, I think, you've mentioned the figure 350,000 hectoliters, which should start [indiscernible], is that split 50:50 at the moment? ", "Mark Hunter", "I don't recall, if we mentioned this, Ina.", "Ian Shackleton", "We know you have the opportunity.", "Mark Hunter", "Let\u2019s just stick to the 150,000 hec on a full year basis in 2016 and obviously we've got an ambition to more that forward from there, but we open again the detail at this stage.", "Ian Shackleton", "Very good. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question is from this line John Faucher with JP Morgan. ", "John Faucher", "Two questions here, the first is can you just give us some rough idea of the magnitude of the incremental investment, just showing us an idea as we look to try to model out the balance of the year and then a second is little bit more sort of Nebulas [ph] from that standpoint potentially, but either seems to be a greater sense of urgency with you guys in terms of looking a lot of the productivity particularly related to Canada and then looking at some of the changes that are going on at Miller Coors, is there something -- do you feel like that's a fair assessment, if there is a greater sense of urgency and if so, what do you think is driving that, because it\u2019s something that investors seem to be picking up on. Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "John, let me take your second question first then Gavin can talk on the specifics on incremental investment or rather than lack of specifics increments of investment. On the second point, I've been very clear that when I commented the role that there is no fundamental change in our strategy but I'm very keen for our business to run harder and faster, and I've talked I think very consistently about the need for us to accelerate our brand building capabilities and performance faster and importantly to improve our capability at the frontend of the business. That is now our working trend, we've rolled our whole fuels sales execution model across all of the sales force in the UK and Canada. So that\u2019s hundreds of people are now changing their behaviors, their routines and we're measuring people in a different way, around both effectiveness and efficiency.", "So, really starting to work harder to unlocking further growth potential in our portfolio as we continue to build that portfolio out and then parallel to that, containing to drive for a new fit for future cost base in the organization. So, I'm very pleased with how the teams have responded and I'm pleased that you're picking up that sense of urgency. It\u2019s not nebulas, it\u2019s important. ", "Gavin do you want to talk about the marketing investments?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sure, John thanks. We're not going to give specifics on that, but what I can said is that we are going to be increasing our marketing spend meaningfully in the U.S. and also in Canada and Internationally. We also -- are particularly in the U.S. have some significant business transformation cost in the back half, you know where we have had some go trials [ph] of our new systems and earlier this year and late last year. We've got some really big one coming forward in the back half and obviously that carries a certain level of cost associated with it.", "But as to giving you specifics, no, we're not going to do that.", "John Faucher", "And should we, should we expect that to be more media related, sponsorships, sort of, all of the above? Any just sort of rough ideas in terms of what buckets it could all go into?", "Mark Hunter", "John, as I mentioned we do have the Coors Light overall which we're in the process of doing at the moment, which is the new contemporary visual identity across all packaging. We've introduced the national television advertising behind Coors Light's Rocky Mountain heritage. We're going to put -- continue to put firepower behind Miller Lite's heritage program which we're very pleased with. We got the styled bottle from 1975 which is actually just gone into market which we're very excited about. We're going to continue to put money in the Above Premium and the craft portfolio's, Blue Moon White IPO for example, we've got the new Leinenkugel seasonal release that's coming up, Harvest Patch Shandy, we've got Redds. I mean I could on and on and on, John so I guess what I'm saying is it's more, I guess it will be weighted more towards media in the back half, yes.", "John Faucher", "Excellent, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial.", "Mark Swartzberg", "My question, really two, one's a follow on to John's and it's simply the incremental spend. Is it something that you had planned in your budget at the start of the year or is this based on things you're seeing here as the year progresses? And then I had an unrelated question.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes, I mean I would say largely in the business it was planned and I would say in the US we probably shaping it up to even a little more than we'd originally planned given some of the activities that we want to do Mark but broadly I would say it was in line.", "Mark Hunter", "I think that's fair Mark and obviously as we've seen a little bit of benefit comes through on the COGS line and in the U.S. is given us the opportunity to make some choices and we're making the right choice which is to further invest behind our brand portfolio, because we're very clear we want to get the business, really claim to win in the U.S. So we're in a position where we can make those choices and I think that the right choices for the long term health of our broad business.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Got it, okay great. And then with the U.S., JV I may have missed at the very beginning, I missed the opening comments but is there any update on the transition to a permanent CEO there?", "Mark Hunter", "Let me give you a couple of headlines, so both Allen and I have been working very hard from a recruitment perspective, have made good progress, we're both delighted with the way that Gavin has landed within the business on an interim basis and the way the team have rallied behind him and the changes that he has already implemented in the business, so I'm confident we should be in a position -- certainly in the near term to start to really confirm how we're going to move forward on a permanent basis. So more to follow, but as I'm sure you'd expect I'm not to start getting into people's career developments on a call like this Mark, but making good progress overall.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Okay, great, thank you guys.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.", "Rob Ottenstein ", "Great, Gavin, a first question. Given the pretty remarkable success of Constellation, with the Mexican brands, what impact has that had on the pricing environment in the U.S., particularly in the light of the fact that in a lot of states the gap now is very low between their brands and the premium brands and there's two possibilities here. One is, it looks in certain states that Constellation is becoming a price leader and they're taking some pretty, an ultra-aggressive price in California so that would be positive, the other way of looking at is, is you know there's been a lot of market share lost to them and that could create more competitive pricing dynamics. So just wondering if first off if you could kind of give us a sense of you know the pricing environment in the US and how things may have changed because of the success they've had.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks Robert, I mean that's quite a question. So I think maybe just of, there's no question that the Mexican imports are playing in the, in somewhat of the same space, refreshing and insatiable [ph] space that the American light lagers are. The good news is that demonstrates that there's a continued relevance of refreshing and insatiable lager beers for the beer drinkers and with Miller Lite and Coors Light we think we've got two great brands that can grow volume and share and compete with them and particularly given some of the great sales and marketing programs that we've got coming. From a pricing point of view I'm obviously not going to you about what our strategy is, what I can tell is that we worked very hard over the last five weeks to develop a very clear point of view on pricing which has been led by Kevin Doyle and the team and that's a pricing strategy that we're communicating with our distributors. So we had a clear point of view, I'm obviously not going to share it, but just remember we do follow that pricing strategy that\u00a0is local in nature, it's varies by brand-by-brand and it's varies market-by-markets and more detail in than Robert, I can't give you.", "Rob Ottenstein ", "No, I'm not looking for your pricing strategy, I\u2019m more in terms of your assessments of the pricing environment versus cost. And so do you think, I think, we're seeing signs that Constellation is starting to become a price leader in certain markets, here at 3% price increase in California, do you think there is the chance of a perhaps a greater umbrella effect from them, than in prior years?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, look Robert, I mean I don't think my answer\u2019s going to be any different other than that we have a clear pricing strategy that we're not going to share publically. That's all about all I\u2019m prepared to say on that particular topic. ", "Rob Ottenstein ", "Okay. I would, I got it. And maybe an easier question, you talked about a couple of years ago, your move in the economy segment to PET, can you give us, I guess, a sense of where that stands now or are you a 100% national and your general assessment of whether that's been a success or not?", "Mark Hunter", "We are not a 100% national, no, but we are on track with the plan that we have in place for that rollout and then so far we're pleased with that, Robert. ", "Rob Ottenstein ", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG.", "Pablo Zuanic", "Hello, everyone. Look, I have two questions. Can you -- just remind us if you can please in terms of the right of refusal mechanics in the event that you're able to buy the other half of the Miller Coors and you own actually 58%, if you can just go through that. And Gavin question for you, in very basic terms, if we think about [indiscernible] top line versus profit margin expansion, I would argue that [indiscernible] there was a lot of improvement in terms of a broad portfolio on top line momentum relative to the industry, but that margins had not improved much, will there be any difference in terms of way that you're doing things right now because given all the changes you've implemented, but I'd like to get more color whether, there is any noise yet in terms of focusing Modelo margins, I mean the past, and less on top line, thanks.", " [Multiple speakers] ", "Gavin Hattersley", "I'd take issue with one thing with one thing you said there, Pablo, because under Tom\u2019s leadership, we actually expanded our operating margins almost double since the beginning of the joint ventures. I think we've been pretty successful from that perspective. From a portfolio transformation point of view, I would say, we've made really nice progress under his leadership as well and we're going to continue to focus on transforming our portfolio. We need to take share of the American light lager segments, we need to continue to put premium onto the portfolio and develop the above premium offerings and we're working very hard for that and I think we've made good progress and I'm going to continue to focus on that in a very deliberate focused and bold way.", "Pablo Zuanic", "At that point, could there be any changes to the medium term profit margin guidance outlook for Miller Coors and this time also [indiscernible] provide that, but you said something that I would be hearing a new on some point?", "Gavin Hattersley", "There has been no update to the guidance that was previously given Pablo.", "Pablo Zuanic", "Thanks, and second question.", "Mark Hunter", "I think let me just add to Gavin's comment, I think, we've been very clear about the three priorities areas within the business, a lot of that continues a good work that Tom and the team did. And looks to accelerate that over the course of the life of our long range plan. So, with regard to other question, obviously all of that information is in our filings from late 2007 and mid-2008. As to the opportunity and clearly it\u2019s purely speculative, what's that right for us to secure a bigger share of the joint venture within the U.S., there is a right of first offer and last offer and some other associated rights, but the detail buying that's in all of the public filings, which I'd refer you to rather than get into them on this call.", "Thanks for your questions. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. ", "Bryan Spillane", "I guess follow up questions, one -- and I might miss this earlier in the call, but just in terms of the your outlook on what the effective foreign exchange will be on pre-tax profits, I think, after the last quarter, we were looking at about 55 million for the year, is that still the right number or is your outlook on the effect from FX changed at all?", "Mark Hunter", "I think, what I say, Bryan, was that, if you have to plan foreign exchange rates at the end of July to our results for the second half of last year and it would have reduced our underlying pretax savings by more than $43 million and so, if you add on to that, the actual foreign exchange impact in the first half of this year is about $27 million and the impact would be more than $70 million year-over-year.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. So the --.", "Mark Hunter", " That's probably what I've said last time. ", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, alright, that helps. Thank you and then I guess the only other question I'd have just been trying to frame how things have progressed through the course of this year versus maybe what you were thinking earlier in the year. Sounds to me like volume in Europe, when you strip out the effect of losing the contracts has actually maybe been a little bit better. And it sounds like maybe volume in Canada has been a little bit worse, and then in the U.S. maybe you've got a little bit better cost-to-goods environment. Is that generally right, am I missing something there in terms of just -- in terms of the smaller pieces, what's been a little better or worse than what you were thinking?", "Mark Hunter", "I'm not sure I would characterize it like that Bryan, I think we're pleased with our overall performance in Europe and as I mentioned if you reverse out the loss of the Modelo brands our shares increased slightly, and certainly the last couple of months through June and July you heard me mention our July STRs, we're seeing you know relatively strong volume growth so that's encouraging and clearly we're right in the middle of peak selling season at the moment and we're up against the impact of the floods from last year, so there's still quite a volatility in the marketplace, so I don't think we're in a different place to what we assumed. And certainly within Canada, sure it's been very clear that stripping out the loss of the Miller brands, there's couple of areas that have, we will look at fixing as we go through the second half of this year or the volume impact as we\u2019ve adjusted pricing in Quebec on Coors Light and just a couple of trading tactics as well.", "But strategically, I feel we're exactly where we anticipated being but you know this is always a game of strategy and tactics and a couple of our tactics will adjust as we go through the second half. But I think the critical thing is back to your first question on FX, we're looking at a $70 million FX headwind as we flagged, we've also flagged up $40 million on the contract losses and we've been very clear that with the strength of our pricing that was seen in the first half, it\u2019s given us some options to invest incrementally in the second half to further strengthen our brand portfolio.", "I mean that's what has happened and will be happening as we go through the second half of the year.", "Operator", "And there're no other questions at this time. Gentlemen do you have any closing remarks.", "Mark Hunter", "I'd just like to thank everybody for the time for joining us on the Molson Coors Q2 earnings call and as I mentioned earlier hopefully we'll see many of you at the Barclays Global Consumer Staples Conference in Boston, on September the 10th. So thank you for your time and interest in our company and look forward to catching up with you in due course. Thanks everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you again for joining us today.

As a matter of policy Molson Coors does not comment on market rumors and we will not be discussing AB InBev SABMiller situation on our call this morning, including during the Q&A session at the end. We will devote our time this morning to our third quarter financial results, then outlook for the balance of 2015.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Dave. Hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call. And we really appreciate you joining us today. With me on the call this morning, I have Gavin Hattersley, the CFO of Molson Coors and the CEO of Miller Coors, Stewart Glendinning, our Canada CEO, Simon Cox, our CEO of European; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Chief Legal and People Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Controller; and obviously Dave Dunnewald, you just heard from our VP of Investor Relations.", "In the third quarter our worldwide volume increased 0.7% driven by strong growth in Europe and International. Underlying earnings were lower due to unfavorable foreign currency, increased brand investments and the termination of our Miller brands agreement in Canada and the Modelo brands in Heineken brewing contracts in UK earlier this year.", "We increased gross margins and consolidated business bases driven by the U.S. and Europe. We invested more in our brands in all over businesses except international, where lower marketing was primarily due to the substantial restructuring of our China business this year.", "In the quarter we continue to transform our portfolio toward above-premium, craft and cider. We expanded the depth and reach of our international brands in fast-growing markets and we increased our commercial capability. We also continued to drive meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation.", "More specifically, in the U.S. Miller Coors achieved its best quarterly performance in premium lights in three years as well Coors Light and Miller Light built momentum and grew share of the segment. We continue to roll out Coors Light's new visual identity and Miller Light launched this tiny bottle and grew quarterly volume for the second time in the past year.", "Outside of the U.S. and Canada Coors Light grew strongly, and we'll soon launch our largest global brand into the highly profitable Columbian market. Miller Coors is the ninth acquisition of the majority interest in the Saint Archer Brewing Company, a San Diego based brewer of award winning craft sales and this acquisition will further strengthen our global craft portfolio which grew nearly 10% in the third quarter. The integration of the Rekorderlig cider business into our UK and Ireland portfolio has gone well and our global cider portfolio grew a low single digit rate in the quarter.", "We continue to restructure our business to ensure we're fit for the future, including the restructuring of our China business the planned closure of the Miller Coors Eden brewery next year following the closure of our Alton UK brewery in May of this year. And importantly we've reached an agreement to sell our Vancouver brewery which will allow us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery in British Columbia.", "Other third quarter performance headlines are as follows, worldwide volume increased 0.7% driven by Europe and International and despite the impact of the termination of the Miller brands agreement in Canada and the Modelo brands contract in the UK. Coors Light volume grew 1% globally driven by nearly 20% volume growth outside of the U.S. and Canada.", "Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 2.3% in constant currency, driven by mix changes within our Europe and International businesses, including the impact of terminating the Modelo brands and Heineken contract-brewing agreements in the UK. And we grew net pricing in the U.S., Canada and Europe in local currency.", "Constant currency net sales increased 0.7% due to higher volume in Europe and International along with the positive net pricing in Canada and Europe. By adding an effect of foreign currency, reported net sales declined 12.9%.", "Underlying pre-tax income of $295.4 million was down 10.9% but decreased 1.7% on a constant currency basis, with the key drivers being increased brand investment and the well documented contract terminations. Underlying after-tax income decreased 4.3% driven by unfavorable foreign currency, higher brand investments and terminated contracts. And these factors were partially offset by higher volume positive net pricing a lower tax rate and the results of the cost savings initiatives.", "U.S. GAAP net income from continuing operations increased $49.4 million from year ago due to lower brand impairment charges this year in Europe. We incurred impairment charges of 275 million this quarter related to some of our Europe brands including the Allen brand because of continued economic and competitive challenges and increased discount rates across the region we have also changed the accounting treatment of these brands from investment lives to definite lives which we expect to increase amortization expense by approximately $50 million per year based on current foreign exchange rates.", "Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $420.2 million, a 10.4% decrease from a year ago, driven almost entirely by unfavorable foreign currency investments. Year-to-date underlying EBITDA was $1.104 billion than 7.7% from a year ago. We also continued to implement our four year 1 billion stock buyback program with $50 million of cash used in the third quarter to repurchase more than 689,000 flat e-common shares from July through early October. Please note that in August we committed another $50 million of cash to be used for stock repurchases during the fourth quarter under accelerated share repurchase program. ", "In terms of regional highlights U.S. underlying pretax income decreased 7.5% due to lower volume including a reduction in distributor inventories versus the year ago and continued softness in our economy portfolio along with higher investments and brands and technology as discussed on our last earnings call. These factors were partially offset by positive net pricing and mix supply chain cost savings and lower brewing, packaging, material and fuel costs. One significant news item from Molson Coors was the appointment of Gavin our CEO in September. Gavin has quickly taken actions across a number of areas to energized and focus the entire organization. Coors Light and Molson Light both grew shares of segment and improved volume trends in the third quarter versus the first half of this year. And meanwhile Miller Light and Coors Banquet grew volume and overall market share. The U.S. portfolio of transformation towards the above premium segment continues with lead brands Blue Moon, Belgian White, Leinenkugel and The Redd\u2019s Family each growing the volume. ", "Through Tenth and Blake, the leading craft grow in the U.S. Miller Coors expanded its growing craft portfolio with the acquisition of Saint Archer Brewing which was completed in October. We are excited about the growth opportunity offered by this Saint Archer brands which represent a variety of sales that complimentary to the current Tenth and Blake portfolio. Including some outstanding Shandy [ph] ales. The U.S. team also announced the plan closure of its Eden, North Carolina, brewery. In Canada underlying pretax income decreased 5.4% in constant currency primarily due to the negative impact of terminating a Miller brands agreement at the end of March of this year. The fact of lowered volume in the quarter was partially offset by positive pricing and substantial cost savings including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency underlying earnings declined by 18.9%. Canada sales to retail our STRs decline 4.9% primarily due to the termination of the Miller contract. Excluding the Miller brand our STRs decline by 0.5% of 1%. In Coors brands Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter. But trends improved versus the second quarter as we rolled out the advertising and commercial executions for Coors Light. And about premium Coors Banquet delivered strong volume and share growth in the third quarter as did Mad Jack Apple Lager, Molson Canadian Cider and Strongbow Cider along with our Granville Island and Creemore craft brands.", "In Europe, underling pretax income increased 7.1% in constant currency driven by higher sales volume positive pricing and lower costs. Despite the loss of the Modelo and Heineken contracts in the UK this year and the release of our regulatory reserve last year. Europe underlying pretax income decreased 6.7% in the quarter due to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. Sales volume increased in 9 of 11 countries and for 8 of our 11 lead brands in the region. Excluding the loss of the Modelo brands the UK market would also have increased volume in the quarter. Equally encouraging areas of Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia that were affected by severe flooding a year ago continued to recover. In Coors brands Carling trends improved, primarily on the year and on Staropramen Bergenbier grew volume and segment share in their core markets. Our craft and above premiums portfolio continued to perform well with Coors Light, Doom Bar and Cobra [ph] all achieving strong growth in the quarter as did above premium Staropramen outside of Czech Republic. ", "Our international business again delivered double digit volume growth in the third quarter driven by triple digit volume growth in India and double digit growth for Coors Light in Latin America. India\u2019s growth was due to strong performance of our existing India business and our acquisition of Mount Shivalik Breweries earlier this year. Due to higher volume in India and Latin America along with lower MG&A we ended the quarter with a $600,000 improvement and international's underlying pre-tax loss versus a year ago, or a $1.8 million improvement excluding the impact of foreign currency movements.", "Now, I'll turn over to Gavin to give additional third quarter financial highlights and perspective on the rest of 2015, Gavin.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks, Mark and hello, everybody. Underlying free cash flow for the first three quarters of 2015 totaled $476.8 million which represent a $289.3 million decrease versus the same period last year. This decrease was primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency and less benefit from working capital changes, including higher cash paid for taxes.", "Our year-to-date free cash flow included the following factors, $461.5 million of operating cash flow and $279.9 million of net add-backs for our discretionary UK pension contribution in January. Settlements of interest swaps the cash impact of special items and Miller Coors investments in businesses. Investing cash outflows included $208.3 million of capital spending. Our underlying free cash flow included $1.088 billion of cash distributions from Miller Coors and $1.145 billion of cash invested in Miller Coors. A detailed reconciliation of our underlying free cash flow is available in our earnings release distributed this morning.", "Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.002 billion and cash and cash equivalents totaled $393.6 million, resulting in net debt of $2.609 billion, which is lower than a year ago, primarily driven by foreign currency movements and debt pay down. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "Looking forward to the balance of 2015, the following full year forward guidance is unchanged from the last quarter. Although we\u2019re not changing our 2015 underlying free cash flow target of $550 million plus or minus 10%. We currently expect our results for the year to be in the upper half of this range and that is between $550 million and $605 million. And we expect our 2015 MG&A expense in Corporate to be approximately $110 million.", "We are revising the following full year guidance. First we now expect capital spending to be approximately $275 million down from $300 million previously largely driven by foreign currency movements. Second we expect our consolidated net interest expense to be approximately $110 million versus $120 million previously driven by favorable foreign currency and interest rates. Third, we now expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be approximately $300 million in 2015, including our 42% of Miller Coors contributions at today's exchange rates. This was revised from the previous guidance of $300 million to $320 million primarily due to foreign currency movements. Fourth, we now anticipate 2015 pension expense of approximately $23 million, including our portion of Miller Coors. And fifth, we now anticipate that our full year 2015 underlying effective tax rate will be in the range of 14% to 16% down from 18% to 22% previously due to the favorable resolution of uncertain tax positions and other tax benefits. After this year, we still expect our underlying tax rate to be near the low end of our long-term range of 20% to 24% for the next few years, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "In 2015 cost outlook, we now expect our full year cost savings to be near the upper end of the $40 million to $60 million range that we've been targeting. By region we continue to expect Europe cost of goods sold per hectoliter to decrease to the low single digit rate this year in local currency and International business cost of goods sold to decrease at a low double digit rate per hectoliter. We now expect Canada cost of goods sold per hectoliter in local currency to increase at a low single digit rate down from the annual guidance of mid-single digit last quarter, driven by lower brewery and distribution costs. And Miller Coors now expects 2015 cost of goods sold per hectoliter to be approximately in line with or slightly below the year before. This is previous guidance of in line. This change is driven by lower packaging commodity and fuel costs.", "And finally regarding the profit and cash headwind from foreign currency that we expect this year, if we apply foreign exchange rates at the end of October to our results for the fourth quarter of 2014, it would reduce underlying pretax earnings for that period by approximately $10 million and the impact on cash would have been even larger. By adding the foreign exchange impact on pretax results for the first three quarters of this year, we arrive at a full-year foreign currency impact of nearly $70 million versus our 2014 consolidated pretax results.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Gavin. In addition to the foreign currency headwind that Gavin just mentioned our results in the fourth quarter of this year will continue to be affected by determination of major business contract which we anticipate will have a full year 2015 profit impact of $40 million pretax. Additionally, we plan to significantly step up our portfolio investments in the balance of this year particularly in the U.S. and Canada. These investments will have a negative impact in the fourth quarter bottom line results, but we expect them to provide benefits long term as we focused on delighting our consumer and our customers to ensure we are the first choice brewer in the geographies and segments where we choose to play.", "Regionally in the U.S. we are driving three key priorities. Job number one is to transform our portfolio and reignite volume growth we are targeting getting our volume trends to flat in 2018 and growth in 2019 for the first time since Miller Coors was formed, and to that we have three focus areas. Firstly, taking share and growing our American Light Lagers Coors Light and Miller Light. As part of the Coors Light overhaul [Audio Gap]. Secondly, continue to the premimize portfolio and further developed [Audio Gap], examples include the successful launches of Blue Moon White IPA and Leinenkugel Grapefruit Shandy this year as well as the acquisition of some [Indiscernible] excellent craft brand and suddenly we've began the process of simplifying un-clarifying our below premium portfolio offering. ", "Job number two is to improve our commercial capability including winning in non-premise and increasing the relevance of our brands in this critical channel, where brands are built, and job number three is to ensure that our cost base is competitive and fits for the future including closing our Eden brewery next year. Consistent with our priorities we intend to invest significantly in our brands and information technology in the fourth quarter including beginning of fuse of enterprise system ramp up starting of this Shanondor brewery. We continuously expect our U.S. underline operating margins for full year 2015 to be relatively flat versus prior year. We would be disciplined, decisive and accountable and remain laser focused on growing our business in the United States from transforming then Miller Coors portfolio. ", "In Canada we continue to invest in our core brands and above premiums including craft, imports and flavored malt beverages. In core brands in the advertising campaign and increased focus on commercial execution on Coors Light are showing early positive signs particularly in our highest share regions. Initial consumer response to our latest advertising created for Molson Canadian has been also been positive. In the fourth quarter we are again investing aggressively in these programs. And above premium our portfolio is benefiting from the strong performance of Coors Banquet Mad Jack Apple lager, Rickard\u2019s Radler and Molson Canadian Cider brands along with Dos Equis, Tecate, Sol and Strongbow. Belgian Moon is also performing well after three months in the Canada market. In Europe determinate Modelo and Heineken contracts Miller Coors continues to present a headwind in the fourth quarter as well in the amortization expense for the brands we impaired this quarter and moved to definite life.", "In some Europe markets we continue to see consumer migrations to all new brands and increased competitive pricing. We\u2019ll continue to invest in a core brand portfolio across Europe to ensure that these brands remain relevant and contemporary for our consumers. In the third quarter the majority of our lead brands grew volume including Ozujsko, Staropramen, Bergenbier and Borsodi. In the balance of this year our Europe theme will be ramping up for the full repay attrition of the Staropramen brand into the UK starting on January the 1st. ", "Additionally, we are implementing significant new initiatives to further improve the efficiency and efficiency of our European operations and provide more resources to invest in driving top line and bottom line growth. As the most recent example we announce earlier this week that we have made a proposal and entered into consultation process in the UK to close our Burton South brewery and consolidate production with another recently modernize Burton North brewery by the end of September 2017. ", "Our international business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis and accelerating our overall growth and expansion in new and existing markets. We\u2019ll continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light develop Coors 1873 in Latin America, including introducing new brands to consumers in the high potential Columbia market. We will also continue to build in Staropramen's momentum in greater Europe and rapid growth on our existing India business with the growth from our newly acquired Mount Shivalik Breweries operation.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends reached of our businesses early in fourth quarter. In U.S. through October 31st STRs decreased at low single digit rate. In Canada through October 31st SPRs were down low double digits excluding the Miller brands last year our Canada SPRs decreased a high single digit rates. In Europe, October sales volume was down mid-single digits partially due to loss of the Modelo brands in the UK. ", "Our international sales volume including royalty volume increased at double digit rate in October. Now as always please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and frames could change in the weeks ahead.", "So to summarize our discussion today, in the third quarter, we grew our worldwide volume and constant currency net sales, increased our gross margins and invested significantly more in our brands. Underlying earnings, however, were lower due to unfavorable foreign currency and the termination of contracts this year.", "There has been a great deal of news flow around the global beer category in recent weeks. Notwithstanding this, our organization remains focused on our strategy of driving brand-led profit growth, meaningful cash generation and disciplined cash and capital allocation. We remain resolute on utilizing PACC as our key business-decision framework, using our cash to reward investors and ensure a healthy balance sheet, reducing costs to provide front-end firepower, and making smart investments to deliver value enhancing growth opportunities. Our strategy is underpinned by highly engaged, passionate and inspired people with the ambition to be First Choice in the eyes of our consumers and customers.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just first the few personal comments about Gavin, as he transitions really to the CEO role within MillerCoors. This is Gavin's 15th quarterly earnings call. And I think everybody has come to recognize this transparent and productive relationships with both our analysts and investor communities. He's been an integral part of the Molson Coors strategy and progress over the last three years, and the good news is that Gavin will remain a member of our executive team here at Molson Coors.", "So, Gavin, from me, just a big personal thank you and best wishes as you become 100% focused on MillerCoors as CEO. You go with our best wishes, Gavin.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "In order to help Gavin focus his full energy and attention on the MillerCoors business, I'm pleased to announce that our Europe CFO David Heede will be stepping into the global CFO role on an interim basis as we work to finalize the selection process for Gavin's successor here at Molson Coors. David has more than 30 years of leadership experience in many areas of our company and he's played a central role in a very successful integration of our Central Europe and UK businesses. David will have a strong global finance team supporting him. And I have every confidence that we'll not miss a beat in this critical area where we complete the global CFO search process.", "And then finally, as usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, 1 pm Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via the recorded webcast on our website.", "So, at this point, Leanne, we'd like to open it up for questions please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.", "Vivien Azer", "My first question has to do with the price mix in Europe, I totally appreciate that the loss of Modelo is a drag there and you called out lower contract brewing volume and negative mix. But I'm trying to kind of get a sense of what's happening kind of underneath that given your commentary on some intensified promotional activity and then a tougher competitive landscape. So, if you could just elaborate on price mix in Europe, that'd be helpful. Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "I'll ask Simon to pick up on that. So, Simon, do you want to just talk to a little bit more of the detail with regard to our Europe performance?", "Simon Cox", "Yes, sure. Thanks for the question Vivien. When you look at our price mix, pricing across Europe is at actually 0.3% positive across the region. And so all the drag on net sales to -- net sales revenue perhaps was to do with mix. And actually you more or less correctly called out the two main drivers of that during your commentary. It is very much to do with the loss of Modelo brands in the UK and the fact that the contract manufacturing revenue is also put into our net sales revenue line but doesn\u2019t actually attract any of the hectoliters because obviously it's not our own sales. And that has quite a significant impact on the overall NSR per hectoliter. So, there isn't too much of the color to add. But we're actually very pleased with the way the brands are performing across, both the UK and the Central European region. And so it is really pricing marginally up and mix driven by Modelo and contract manufacturing is the drag.", "Vivien Azer", "And just a follow-up on -- is it fair to say that more muted price increases are reasonable to anticipate just given the broader macro environment in the EU?", "Simon Cox", "As you know, we don't give forward guidance on pricing. But historically if you look into our performance over the last three quarters, we've issued a sensible balance I think between volume and pricing. We're orientating our portfolio much more towards maintaining strong positions in our core brands and ensuring that in pockets of value growth like cider, craft beer in the UK, premium brands, Staropramen growth in Czech Republic. These are all things that can support overall pricing growth and that's where we're orientating our portfolio. So, that's been working well for us I think over the past three quarters. And that's where we're going to focus on.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Your line is open.", "Ian Shackleton", "Obviously, Gavin set out some targets of volume growth for MillerCoors going forward. I just wonder what assumptions around that were on pricing mix and whether we assume the lower number that you\u2019ve been reporting today, I just have a 1% as sort of guideline, we should be expecting the future on the higher number that we've had into last couple of years?", "Mark Hunter", "I let Gavin get into the detail, but obviously, the principal response is we don't give any guidance with regard to future pricing. But Gavin, do you want to talk a little bit more about ambitions in terms of getting back to flat volume?", "Gavin Hattersley", "We do want to be flat in 2018 and grow in 2019. We\u2019ve got a very strategy and very clear plans to achieve that. It requires significant focus on our Premium Lights brands with Coors Light and Miller Lite and we are very pleased that we in the third quarter had the best performance in those two combined brands in over three years. And it does require us to transform our portfolio more into the above-premium and get really specific about what we\u2019re doing with our economy brands.", "Mark Hunter", "More broadly, I mean our medium-term guidance in terms of pricing hasn't been updated for our U.S. business. So, no color over that.", "Ian Shackleton", "Just a quick follow-up, I mean you've gone through last couple of years surprises and quite a few this quarter on the tax rate on the positive side, i.e., so it was coming beneath what we\u2019d expect and we\u2019ve got another example of that today for the full year. Could you just give us a little bit more granularity what is helping particularly in this quarter to bring down that rate?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Look, I mean the one thing we can't predict is when we\u2019re going to resolve uncertain tax positions. They are uncertain for a reason and obviously we can't predict when we resolve them. And we again resolved some uncertain tax positions in the third quarter. And having said, so the large change of the reduction to 14% to 16% is related to that. And we haven't changed our longer term guidance of 20% to 24%. And in the shorter term, for example next year, we expect towards the lower end of that, that remains unchanged. If you want to get a feel for the level of uncertain tax positions that are still out there, formal SEC filings of the Qs would give you some guidance on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Judy Hong", "So, just on Canada, Mark, I think I may have missed the October STR number excluding the Miller brand?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, it's a high single digit decline. ", "Judy Hong", "Just any reason, why it was so low sequentially?", "Mark Hunter", "Stewart, do you want to give a little bit of a flavor as to what you're seeing in Canada coming through the third quarter and any commentary around the start of the fourth quarter?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Judy, overall the market was much healthier in the third quarter, benefiting from some warmer weather. Our portfolio was in a much better place. Going into the fourth quarter, nothing has changed in that portfolios, it's still robust, activity levels strong. Really the only big item in the -- in October to point out is that there is one less trading day in October but other than that there is nothing materially that\u2019s going on in the marketplace. ", "Judy Hong", "So, maybe just a calendar issue, as opposed to\u2026", "Mark Hunter", "The other think I would additional is, as per my prepared remarks, if you look at our STRs for the quarter, when you exclude the loss of the Miller brands, the volume is down about 0.5%. So on underlying basis, I would describe our volume performance as reasonably solid.", "Judy Hong", "And then Stewart, just maybe if we can get an update on your brewery optimization plan in Canada. And we've heard a little bit during the quarter in terms of the Vancouver and I think potentially maybe an update on the Montreal side. So, what are some of the updates that you can provide us with respect to the recent announcements and how you would plan to optimize and the margin impact that would have in 2016 and beyond?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Okay, Judy but not a lot we can say obviously on margin since we don't give any forward guidance. But good news coming out of Vancouver for sure, that was an old brewery that was going to consume a bunch of capital and we have been able to lock-in contract for sale of the property. Broadly the sale of that property will fund the construction of a new brewery. And when we move into that brewery, we should expect to see lower going forward CapEx and the lower operating costs on that brewery. In Montreal, we have a similar study underway to understand whether we should invest in the current brewery or to invest in new build. And I won\u2019t have the answer to that question until likely early next year. Overall, I think we've got a very strong plan for reshaping the supply chain in Canada. And of course that's one of the things that's driving the estimates of savings that the Gavin's provided to the Street.", "Judy Hong", "Stewart, if I can just follow up, if I think about from a capacity standpoint in Canada, it seems like because you are building a new brewery in Vancouver, the capacity numbers really don\u2019t change much in Canada despite some of the volume declines that we've seen in the last few years. Can you just comment on why you wouldn\u2019t necessarily take out more capacity and looking at the breweries in Canada?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Look, I never actually spoke to the capacity to conclude whether we would take it up or take it down. What I will say is we are going to build the brewery to provide the best operating efficiencies for our company. And more importantly, what you get with a new brewery is the ability to drive a more flexible brewing. If you look at what's going on in the market today, it's important to be able to provide a wide range of brew sizes to accommodate the smaller brew stuff. I think we\u2019ll gain a lot of from that. But you can rest assured that rightsizing our capacity is a key part of our plan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher from JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "John Faucher", "Question for Gavin. Gavin, you talked about -- when you talked about sort of the changes in the U.S. business, particularly on Coors Light with the focus I think on a new agency but sort of the same Rocky Mountain heritage. So, is that a sign that the message isn\u2019t the issue, it's been the delivery of the advertising or the amount of the advertising; is there some lesson learned there that we should glean from the fact that the campaign idea generally stays exactly where it is?", "Gavin Hattersley", "I would say couple of things there. Obviously changing an agency not going to change the direction of the Coors Light brand. It\u2019s the total package as it relates to Coors Light. So, our new brand identity which we launched in the second quarter and which really got completely rolled out in the third quarter is part of that being extraordinarily well-received by both distributors, customers and retailers a lot. And so we\u2019re pleased with the performance in Coors Light which has been driven largely by that over the last couple of quarters. And as David said on this morning's call, Coors Light\u2019s performance in the third quarter was the base that we've had for quite some time.", "And our new above the line marketing campaign will be focused on Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment. There will be a different way of expressing that than you have seen in the past. And thirdly, we are putting significantly more money behind Coors Light. And we\u2019ve put large -- meaningfully more behind Coors Light in the third quarter and we\u2019re seeing the impact of that. So, I wouldn\u2019t point to just any one thing but a total package of what we're doing on Coors Light, John.", "Mark Hunter", "John, its Mark here. The only thing I would add to that is if you look across the global footprint of Coors Light, Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment isn\u2019t up for debate. That's what the brand stands for that's its absolute bedrock. And we consistently dramatize that across all of the market that we execute the brand. And clearly to Gavin's point, how we dramatize it in the U.S. is going to be evolved but that will still be very much of a bringing to Light Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment in a way that's contemporary relevant and distinct. And David Kroll this morning spoke to the need for us actually to develop campaign ideas in the U.S. that have got longevity so that we can get behind something and drive it over the medium to long-term as opposed to changing creative ideas on a annual or biannual basis. The Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment is absolutely in the heart of what Coors Light stands for.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Philipp Gusinde from MUFG. [Ph] Your line is now open.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Actually I had a two-part question, if I may. The first one is with regard to the accelerated share repurchase program. Do you have any commitments beyond the $50 million that you talked about for the current quarter? And then the second question, trying to be very respectful of Dave's question, or request not to talk about any potential activity in the space, but if I may perhaps ask a more holistic question, just talking a bit about capital allocation as you have talked about in the past. If you were to state a once in a lifetime opportunity, have been Molson and Coors family ever talked about then potentially contributing new equity if that's were to be required in order to maintain an investment grade rating?", "Mark Hunter", "Let me try and do with both of those questions. On the first question on the share repurchase program, we\u2019ve set out $1 billion repurchase program over four years but the majority of that towards the latter half of that program. We've confirmed what we've done in the third quarter and what's likely to happen in the fourth quarter. On our next earnings call, we will update you with regard to progress on that program. So, there is no new news with regard to our share repurchase program.", "With regard to capital allocations, I don\u2019t think this call is a time or place to get into discussions about what the preferences are of the Molson or the Coors family would be. Under certain circumstances, the families have been long term investors in the beer industry, we are talking centuries here, not just quarters. And they've said that they\u2019re very committed to the long-term vitality of our organization. So, as opportunities come and go, we'll consider them appropriately with our board but those will be confidential board discussions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Bryan Spillane", "Just two questions, one is, in Europe, I think in the press release, there is a mention of, there was a reserve that was released during the quarter. Could you give us a sense of just how much of an impact that had on profit?", "Mark Hunter", "Do you remember the specifics? They\u2019re released last year. Simon or David do you have that\u2026", "Simon Cox", "We didn't give the specific number last year but we said that it was a factor in our results in third quarter of 2014, but no specific number\u2019s been provided.", "Bryan Spillane", "And then, I guess more broadly, just as we're thinking about free cash flow, this year we had a few items that negatively affected free cash flow. I guess as we start thinking forward from here, is the Vancouver brewery -- I guess I understand that it's going to be net cash neutral once you sell the property and build but is there a period of time where that will potentially be a drag on free cash flow? And then also in terms of pensions, with interest rates still having not moved yet, or just a way the markets have behaved, is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms of pensions that might cause you to have to contribute more, again I guess next year?", "Mark Hunter", "Gavin, do you want to take that?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sure. Look Bryan, we haven't given any guidance for 2016 and beyond on cash flow at this stage. I guess the only point that I would make is that if we did build a brewery, it would be out of multi years; you don't necessarily just build it in the one year. And I guess that's what our concern that particular point. As far as pension contributions are concerned, I think our requirements under the UK Pension Plan which for Molson Coors remains a biggest pension cash contribution area, quite clearly laid out in our financial filings. So, you can have a look at those, there Bryan. And as know, we made a one-off contribution this year, which impacts the contributions that we have to make in the IPOs. It's very clearly set on.", "Mark Hunter", "Gavin, just one other additional perspective. Bryan, if you look back at the changes we made our UK supply chain over the course of the last five years, I mean we've fundamentally transformed and modernized our manufacturing facilities in the UK. And we've managed to that all within what you describe as a pretty normal capital envelope within our business. We expect to be able to do something similar in Canada looking at the cash that we secure from for example Vancouver brewery [indiscernible] under requirement to continue to modernize our brewery network in Canada. So, I think our track record speaks to our ability to modernize our manufacturing facilities and do that in a way which is within a recognized capital envelope in the business.", "Gavin Hattersley", "One other think I'd like to just clarify there, Bryan. You said that the proceeds and the investments would offset each other but in terms of how that's disclosed in cash flow, for the proceeds from the sale of the Vancouver property would not be included in underlying free cash flow but capital investments would.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel Nicolas. Your line is open.", "Mark Swartzberg", "A few questions on Canada, one just a technical one, the down high single digit comment at the Miller impact for October, what would that number be if we have it on an equal selling days basis?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes, I agree with the question. Stewart, I'll be impressed if you know the answer to that, but Dave, do you want to\u2026.", "Dave Dunnewald", "I do, it's somewhere around 5% Bryan. But yes -- so it's right around 5% is the technical answer.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Okay, down 5 for the month of October excluding the Miller impact on an apples-to-apples days basis.", "Dave Dunnewald", "Apples-to-apples, one less trading day equates to about 4.9 something but rounded to 5, if you want.", "Mark Swartzberg", "And then, total brewing capacity in Canada, have you disclosed what that figure is? Can you disclose what the total brewing capacity across the country is?", "Dave Dunnewald", "To my knowledge, we haven't disclosed that. I think the more important thing is to recognize that as we reshape up the supply chain footprint for the country, of course you're going to be looking at what our needs are, what kind of brewing we're going to be undertaking and where best to brew it and capacity will be wrapped into that.", "Mark Swartzberg", "And then, I guess the last on Canada, all of you have this goal of improving above premium craft and cider performance. I think you've been very clear about how that looks here in the U.S. and there's some real progress there. I think there's progress there in Canada as well. But could you talk a little bit about more about how well positioned you are presently for that and what the trends in that component of Canada look like?", "Mark Hunter", "Mark, was that an MCBC question or Canada specific question? Sorry, you broke up a little bit just\u2026", "Mark Swartzberg", "Yes, specific to Canada. I think we've good visibility on how you\u2019re positioned here in the U.S. but with Canada, I was wondering how you\u2019re positioned and how the outlook against that objective is?", "Mark Hunter", "I mean just in headline terms, Stewart and his team are really driving three big change initiatives across our Canadian business, partially transforming our supply chain and making sure that we really are fit for future, secondly ensuring our cost structure, again as competitive, and thirdly, we're working very hard on transforming the portfolio which includes driving further into above-", "premium and cider, craft et cetera. So, Steward, do you want to just give a color on the progress that made over the last couple of years and the momentum is building in that particular part of the portfolio?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Yes, certainly Mark. I mean all of the changes primarily that have taken place have been at the top end of the portfolio. We've been -- as you know, we have The Six Pints team here, which is our equivalent in Canada of Tenth and Blake. That group with craft brands [ph] Granville, and Creemore have been driving those brands across the country, so craft portfolio growing rapidly. We also recently introduce Belgian Moon into a Canada, that reception\u2019s been very warm with strongly encouraged by the rate of sale that we've seen in those where we\u2019ve brought that brand into customers. And then of course, the biggest launch of all, so far has been Coors Banquet which we brought in at a premium price position and that's better than one share of the market now. So, I would say those are the big ones. On the apple side of course, we\u2019ve got two very quick growing ciders which is the Strongbow and own Molson Canadian Cider and then this year, we launched Mad Jack, which is an apple flavored lager. So, all of those apple variants are performing strongly, all of them playing at the upper end of the market.", "Mark Swartzberg", "And when you think about your view of where the consumer\u2019s going against those opportunities, is it right to think, tuck-ins and innovation and just good spending in plant against the brands that already exist there, that's how you think about executing further against that goal?", "Stewart Glendinning", "I think that makes a lot of sense. So I will say, it's an important just to understand the dynamics across the broad market. There are consumer needs, at every segment of the market and to exclude one at the expense of the other doesn't make sense. Premiums are huge out of our business and so that remains an important focus in innovation as well.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Okay, great, thank you Stewart, thanks everyone. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "No, I'm sorry, Bryan, I meant to mention one part of the market also. As you know, this year we've also broaden the types [ph] of brands and Dos Equis and Sol had the nice portfolio and they're also growing well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is open. ", "Rob Ottenstein", "I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about your plans and strategy for Coors Light outside of the U.S. and Canada and maybe perhaps start by giving a some sense of what percentage of Coors Light volumes are outside of U.S. and Canada; how much they grew in the quarter and on average roughly how they\u2019re positioned pricewise outside of North America, what percentage of mainstream price in place?", "Mark Hunter", "So let me just give you a little bit contexts and I\u2019ll ask Simon to talk about the Coors Light progress in the UK and Ireland and then Kandy to talk more broadly about our other international markets. We don't offer percentage of our volume, relating the proportion of Coors Light outside of North America but it's into millions of hectoliters. So, I'll give you a sense of scale. And through the quarter, we grew at 20%, outside of the U.S. and Canada. So, it's a meaningful presence as growing very rapidly. So clearly within the UK and Ireland that brand has been there now for approximately a decade. Simon, do you want to just give a flavor for the momentum you're seeing and Kandy can talk more broadly, outside of the UK and Ireland.", "Simon Cox", "Yes, thank you for the question. And Coors Light has been performing as one of the strongest performing brands in the market for over three years and this quarter is no exception, we've seen double-digit growth of course like in the UK and Ireland this quarter. And basically, it\u2019s just a brand that continues to work extremely well for our consumers and on for our customers and for us.", "In terms of answering your question around pricing index, it tends to be priced above the mainstream. So on the on-trade, if you walk into a typical English pub, you will see calling on the bars, mainstream price, and you will Coors Light generally at a 5% to 10% premium to that. That's a similar trend into UK off-trade although of course that's a little bit more volatile, based on what tends to be quite a discount driven off-trade market. But generally, it comes under premium to mainstream pricing and in the UK and Ireland is continuing in really strong growth for us. So, very important brand in that portfolio and doing extremely well.", "Rob Ottenstein", "And in terms of India, can you give us a sense of what the organic volume growth was there?", "Mark Hunter", "Rob, why doesn\u2019t Kandy give you a flavor for what\u2019s happening with Coors Light and talk specifically about the India performance. Kandy?", "Kandy Anand", "As you know Coors Light has been engine of growth for us for several quarters in the last couple of years. It continues to grow very strong double digits with a big focus on Latin America. It grows on the back of an earlier answer that Mark gave, on Rocky Mountain Cold Refreshment. We are very much focused on that positioning. We think it relies for marketing programs, placements of coolers and working with our partners and sales execution. And we see that that growth continuing in the future. We also spoke about our excitement about our launch in Colombia which actually happens next week and they are doing that in partnership with CCC which is a joint venture of CCU in Postob\u00f3n and Colombia. So that\u2019s on Coors Light overall. In the international business, we've also -- you asked about India. On India, we\u2019re very pleased with our progress this year. Our overall volumes have grown triple digit along with the acquisition. But just on that organic basis on the royalty [ph] acquisition our volumes are also growing double digit there. So, at this point of time, we are still under three steps that we spoke about during the June conference and continue to drive our business through that.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Kandy, in terms of the Coors Light pricing in Latin America, is it also a 5% to 10% premium to mainstream or is it a higher premium there?", "Kandy Anand", "Typically it's been a higher premium in those markets. We tend to have a pricing of on the average 20% above the mainstream. It of course varies by market, maybe a little bit less than one and more on the other but on the average we target 20ish pricing premium. ", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is now open.", "Brett Cooper", "Hi, guys, a few questions. In the past, you've confirmed impairments in Europe were a function of specific brands. And then if you look at the portfolio in total, the appreciation in value of non-impacted brands offset the brands where impairments have been taken. Can we get a similar confirmation today, given the impairments in the quarter?", "Mark Hunter", "Sorry Brett, could you just -- there was a lot in that question. Could you just repeat that again, please, apologies.", "Brett Cooper", "Specifically, when you guys take impairments on the European brand, its brands specific and what you've done in the past it's that if you look at the value of Staropramen, it offsets the impairments you've taken. And since we have a new impairment today, I just wanted to make sure that that\u2019s still the case. That the sort of the total portfolio, if you will is better off in terms of intangibles than when you bought the business?", "Mark Hunter", "That is correct. So, we've seen very strong performance as you pointed out, for example on Staropramen. So, that's correct yes.", "Brett Cooper", "Should have asked this morning but in the U.S. the business transformation expenses that you looked on 2016, those continued -- sorry, in the end of 2015 here. Those continue as you go through the transformations through 2017; is that correct or should they abate for any reason?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes. That's correct, Brett. We will continue to incur meaningful BT expenses in 2016 and also in 2017 although it\u2019s slightly lesser.", "Brett Cooper", "And then finally, in Canada, is actually according to your cost savings that you guys are delivering at Molson Coors excluding your share of the MillerCoors piece are coming from Canada and you are beginning to see some traction on what you are doing at Coors Light. Is there a need or desire to reinvest more of those savings to get the business back to share stability? Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "Well. Brett, I think we laid that in the last quarter that our intention was to invest incrementally through the second half of this year. And I mentioned already on the call the economic engine of our businesses is the strength of our brands. So, we remain committed to invest to build our brand equity and our brand health. We outweighed our investment in Canada through the third quarter and continue to plan to do the same in the fourth quarter, so very much in line with the guidance that we gave around the second half of this year. Building the strength of our brands in Canada is an absolute priority for us.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic from SIG. Your line is open.", "Pablo Zuanic", "Good morning everyone. In your prepared remarks, you said that you are planning on working on simplifying and clarifying your value brands. So three questions on that. One, can you elaborate on what do you mean by that? I think simplifying means SKU cuts but clarifying the message? So that's one. Two as you define them, value brands would be percentage roughly of your volumes or revenues? And three, again roughly on Coors Light EBIT margin versus some of these value brands, roughly what the difference here at the gross margin level or EBIT margin that would be very helpful? Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Pablo. A lot of detail in that, Gavin, did you manage to get that...", "Gavin Hattersley", "I'll give a shot and if I miss anything, then somebody will correct me. From a simplification point of view, it does go to SKU simplification. We have a lot of brands in that segment and we have a lot of different packages. So simplifying that is a key focus area for us. In terms of what brands are in there, brands such as Miller High Life which has been around for over a 100 years and it's very clearly differentiated. We have brands like Keystone in that area and then we have regional brands such as Hamm. And so, making sure that we have a very clear positioning and message behind those brands is the work we're doing. The differentiation from a price point of view is it can be varied but if Coors Light and Miller Lite are in a 100, economy can be anywhere from anywhere from -- in our portfolio from 72% to 90% of that. And then from an overall portfolio point of view which I think was your other question, it is around a quarter of our portfolio would be in the below premium segment. I think I\u2019ve covered a little.", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, the only other thing that Pablo asked was about our margin comparisons that we incurred like in the rest of portfolio and that\u2019s not information we go in the public domain other than the that\u2026", "Unidentified Analyst", "Understood, but just a follow-up, thank you for that. So in terms of target of reaching flat volumes, I think it was 2018 or 2019; how is this particular strategy supposed to play out? Is this a headwind or a tailwind in terms of volume growth? Because of you are guiding SKU simplifying that would mean potentially a reduction if you can clarify that please? Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "So, I mean the [indiscernible] portfolio would definitely be a headwind for us in terms of achieving that that means we need to perform better on premiums and above-premiums, no question about that.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from the line of Andrew Holland from Societe Generale. Your line is open.", "Andrew Holland", "Just we haven't really talked so much about Europe. And I just wanted to try and distinguish between your performance in the UK and your performance in Central Europe. So, just first looking at price mix which you say was down in Europe. Is that entirely attributable to the UK and the loss of Heineken and Modelo? And can you tell me if price mix was actually up across your Central European countries, is number one. And something similar for volume, you said was up in 9 out of 11. I guess that one of two volumes were down would have been in the UK again because of the loss of Heineken and Modelo brands, can you confirm that that is the case and give us an idea of volume ex the UK?", "Mark Hunter", "I\u2019ll ask Simon to talk in a little bit more detail in a second. I did cover in my prepared remarks the fact that if you strip out the loss of the Modelo volume in UK that UK business would have been in volume growth. So that was one of your specifics. We don't tend to breakout price or volume information on a market-by-market basis. So Simon, is there any additional color that you would offer you Andrew\u2019s question?", "Simon Cox", "I think you've probably broadly covered it there, Mark. I mean it's a similar answer to the first question I gave that the reduction in NSR per hectoliter is all driven by the two factors of the Modelo brands in the UK and the loss of contract manufacturing. And just to explain that again, obviously the revenue from contract manufacturing goes into our net sales revenue line but the volume denominator perhaps [ph] because only pertains to our owned brand sales, so it's actually quite a significant headwind in terms of the overall what we call out as mix. If you strip that out and if you strip Modelo out, then you'd get a more positive picture. So, that's really the main explanation there. Pricing across Europe and UK was pretty similar and pretty solid. And then as Mark just alluded to, if you remove the impact of the Modelo brands, then the UK business would have also slightly grown it's volumes. So, if you triangulate that against a 5% overall increase in volume and that gives you an idea of the relative performance of Central Europe which was very positive through the quarter.", "Mark Hunter", "So, I think that concludes the questions. So, just on behalf of the team here at Molson Coors, I'd like to thank you all for joining us on our third quarter earnings call. And just as a reminder Dave Dunnewald will as usual be hosting a more detailed call at 1'o clock this afternoon, Dave? Yes, 1'o clock Eastern Time. So, many thanks for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. And we look forward to catching up with all of you through the fourth quarter and beyond.

Now, I will turn the call over to Dave Dunnewald. Global Vice President of Investor Relations for Molson Coors.", "Dave Dunnewald", "Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of Molson Coors Brewing Company, thank you for joining us today for our 2015 earnings follow-up earnings conference call. Our goal on this call is to address as many additional earnings-related questions as possible, following our earnings regular conference call with Mark Hunter, David Heede, and our business unit CEOs earlier today. We will use a standard question-and-answer format, and we anticipate that the call will last less than an hour.", "Before we begin, I will paraphrase the Company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussions today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the Company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings, for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The Company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the day they are made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the Company's executives in discussing our performance, please visit the Company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab of the Investor Relations page, for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results. Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the Company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period, and in U.S. dollars. We also encourage investors and analysts to read SABMiller PLC news releases and trading statements that include financial and other information relating to the MillerCoors joint venture.", "So let's get started with an introduction of the team with me on the call today. We have Kevin Kim, Investor Relations Senior Manager; Ashley Dunlop, Finance Forecasting Senior Manager; Brian Tabolt, Controller; Mike Rumley, Treasurer; and Mark Saks, VP of Tax. And we also have a special cameo appearance from David Heede, Interim Global CFO.", "Regarding quarterly results, as Mark Hunter mentioned on our regular earnings call this morning, the most important strategic development for Molson Coors in 2015 was the definitive agreement we reached late in the year, to purchase the other 58% of MillerCoors that we do not currently own, along with the international rights to the Miller brand. Beyond this game-changing transaction for our Company, we are pleased with the overall progress that our Company made in 2015. We exceeded our targets for cash generation and cost savings, and expanded gross margins and underlying pretax margins globally.", "We grew our above-premium craft FMB and cider business globally, gained share in the key premium light segment in the U.S., and accelerated the growth of our international business, including a bolt-on acquisition in the fast-growing India market. In 2016, we will continue to focus on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, investing behind the strength of our core brand positions, and continuing to premiumize the portfolio.", "So with that, we would now like to open it up for your questions. Over to you, Lori.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ian Shackleton of Nomura. Your line is open.", "Ian Shackleton", "The question really around modeling for this year, and I know it's a tricky thing, because we don't quite know when the MillerCoors deal will complete sometime in H2. Clearly, you've got a lot of shares that you've issued and I'm just thinking when you report Q1 and probably Q2, which will before the deal completes, you're going to have a lot more shares issued, you're going to have more cash on the balance sheet. I guess we should be modeling that through, because clearly, it's got a dilutive on that in the short term, or is there something I am missing on that?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Right. You have nearly 30 million additional shares now in the marketplace, so that does have implications for any calculation that includes shares. In the meantime, right, we have significant cash on our balance sheet, and we'll obviously handle that cash in the best interest of our shareholders. But I think you're thinking about the right pieces.", "Ian Shackleton", "Okay. My understanding, and certainly this is possibly only for IFRS accounting, which I know is not applicable to you, but if there is additional debt funding being taken like ABI has, you might be able to capitalize if you want the carry costs until the deal completes. But it's different for you, isn't it, because you've issued the shares, and you can't really calculate a carry cost, I guess?", "Dave Dunnewald", "I don't know a way to calculate the carry costs, except for the dividends associated with the additional shares, which you would want to take those into account.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Bryan Spillane", "Just a couple of modeling questions. First, just to follow up on Ian's question now about the shares and the dividend, your free cash flow guidance is before or after dividends?", "Dave Dunnewald", "The free cash flow does not include dividends.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. And the dividend, I know it's a stub, but the dividend is going to be just a lot higher, right, because of the extra shares that are out there? The cash dividend.", "Dave Dunnewald", "We'll pay about nearly 30% more dividend specifically related to issuing the additional shares.", "Bryan Spillane", "Right.", "Dave Dunnewald", "And we -- that's not on top of, but it's also important to note that we have said that we will maintain the same dividend at, what do you call it, same dividend as cash per share quarterly amount.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. It will make the cash flow between now and the time the deal closes, it's just going to eat up a little more cash flow. It will definitely have a dampening effect on the cash flow?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Well, it will be essentially, to call it simple math, would be additional dividends minus whatever interest income we earn on those cash balances, in anticipation of closing the transaction.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, and then the next question, just on the interest expense expectation that you gave, ex MillerCoors, is that also net of whatever income you're expecting from the proceeds that are hung up on the balance sheet now?", "Dave Dunnewald", "The interest expense and the other guidance metrics that we gave you on the earlier call are all excluding any impacts from the pending MillerCoors transaction.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. So the interest that you're going to earn, that you should earn on the cash that you're holding onto now is not netted against that $110 million guidance?", "Dave Dunnewald", "That's correct.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. So what we will see, I guess, just thinking, you should earn interest in the first quarter that would help negatively offset some of that expense, right?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Yes, some of it. As you know, short-term interest rates are still very, very low, but we'll definitely do our best for our shareholders on that.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. No, based on the Bank of America stock price, it seems like interest rates are going to stay low forever. Okay. And then just in terms of the, there's some items -- I just want to get some clarification on some of the items that were puts and takes to 2015 and how they wraparound to 2016. So for instance, in terms of the lost licenses in Canada, the Miller brand, that goes -- when does that completely anniversary?", "Dave Dunnewald", "March of 2016. End of March. We'll have a bit of a comparison issue there in the first quarter, although it's a relatively small quarter, but nonetheless, a bit of a comparison challenge there, specifically related to that contract, and then that's it.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, and then the other ones, just in terms -- I'm just trying to make sure that I capture the stuff that wraps around. That's the most meaningful one that will affect 2016?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Right. We've cycled all the other contracts already.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay, okay. And then in the $50 million to $70 million of cost savings that you talked about for the next two years, does that include the benefit from closing -- like you did a brewery closing in the UK. Does it also at all -- I guess Vancouver hasn't happened yet. I'm just trying to understand is that, like how much of that $50 million to $70 million includes the wrap-around benefit for some of the things that occurred in 2016, or is that all truly incremental to what's already in motion?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Well, one of our cost savings initiatives spread over multiple years, particularly as they pertain to things like supply chain, sometimes procurement. What I would say is the $50 million to $70 million isn't, call it, increased results from, call it, additional or upsized cost savings initiatives, and it would -- essentially the $50 million to $70 million would include all of our cost savings that we expect to achieve in the next couple of years outside of MillerCoors and outside of the MillerCoors transaction.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay and then just the last one, just pension expense, I didn't quite catch it on the call. The incremental pension expense in 2016 versus 2015?", "Dave Dunnewald", "So the pension expense number, approximately $17 million, down from $40 million in 2015, and that's a funded status of about 97%, so call it the gap, if you will, is only about $160 million on a $4 billion-plus base. And if we're looking for cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, we're anticipating $45 million to $65 million in 2016, down from a much higher number of $250 million, because we are not planning to make a discretionary contribution to our UK plans this year, as we did last year. I would hasten to add that includes -- both of those numbers I gave you, actually all of them, are related to pensions, includes our 42% of MillerCoors pension.", "Bryan Spillane", "And maybe just one last one related to pensions, and I'll turn it over. Just when you merge, when Miller -- assuming that MillerCoors and Molson Coors merge, is there any pension remeasurement that happens at MillerCoors, that would either cause a step-up in cash or a step-up in expense?", "Dave Dunnewald", "There may be some adjustments that need to be done related to purchase accounting, but I'm not going to speculate on what those would do at this point.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Your line is open.", "Vivien Azer", "So I just wanted to follow up on Bryan's question in terms of just a phasing of different cash items. So when you offered your preliminary guidance for the fourth quarter a couple weeks ago, you raised the free cash flow target because of benefits from working capital, both for Molson Coors as well as MillerCoors. How do we think about that going forward? Does that need to unwind?", "Dave Dunnewald", "So I guess the main point there is the free cash flow upside versus our original guidance was not -- did not have significant timing, call it, differences or timing effect in it between 2015 and 2016.", "Vivien Azer", "Okay. Perfect. Perfect. That's helpful. Is there anything else that you want to call out from a lapping perspective?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Related to working capital? You mean related?", "Vivien Azer", "Yes, distribution.", "Dave Dunnewald", "I would say that a couple of things. We did do some small bolt-on transactions in 2015. Not going to try to predict what might be -- what we might be doing in 2016, but you need to be aware of that. You do have the higher dividends, which we talked about earlier, and working capital, you probably recall. We had particularly three main years, 2012, 2013 and 2014, where we had some major working capital projects going on, and really had some nice results. And we continue to work on working capital, reducing our working capital, but it does become somewhat more difficult over time to come up with additional improvements in working capital. But you can tell from 2015 we still achieved some, but let's say the low-hanging fruit were largely picked back in 2012 through 2014, and we'll keep working on it. But I just wanted to highlight that for you.", "Vivien Azer", "Got it. That's perfect. Thank you. In terms of Miller Lite in the U.S. and the quarterly result there, can you quantify how much the launch of the steinie bottle, how much of an impact that had?", "Dave Dunnewald", "No, but I would say that it's yet another step in the process of really, how do you say, tapping into the authentic roots of that brand, so it's a very -- anyway, it's going great. And it is a limited time bottle, but it went well enough that you may see it again. The other thing Kevin mentioned is related to free cash flow. It also mentioned we do have some FX headwinds in 2016, which would be incremental to what we saw in 2015, based purely on the FX rates at the end of January.", "Vivien Azer", "Okay. Perfect. Got it. In terms of the FX impacts that you are experiencing in Europe, if I contrast the magnitude of the hit that you are getting on the top line versus the bottom line, obviously this moves around for everybody, but order of magnitude, there was a pretty big disconnect in the fourth quarter. Is there anything transactional that would have driven that?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Well, yes. What you're dealing with in Europe is a lot of currencies. In Canada, it's relatively simple math. You can go look at your Bloomberg terminal and get a sense of the translational impact, and then, okay, you know about the kinds of hedging activity that we do to mitigate that to some extent. But in Europe you have lots of currencies. You have inputs in not only USD-denominated currencies and some in Euros. It's a much more complex equation in Europe. If you're not seeing a one-on-one trade across, for example, how the Euro is performing versus the U.S. dollar, one reason is a big chunk of our business is in the UK, so actually the pound is very important there, as well as other currencies on lots of those Central European countries. I think that's why you're not seeing a one-for-one relationship, the way you might see it in Canada.", "Vivien Azer", "Okay. But this quarter, the impact to your pre-tax income was far less significant than it was to sales. Is that a relationship that can persist, or those two numbers should normalize, come in line together over time?", "Dave Dunnewald", "I'm not going to forecast it for you, but I would say that the performance of the UK pound was very critical in that. I would say we also had a lot of factors between net sales. I'm not sure whether you're looking at a constant currency, the constant currency pretax numbers versus the net sales constant currency numbers we gave you. But actually, let's see. In fact, why don't I just look at those? You've got pretax impact on the, call it for the full year, or were you just looking at the quarter? Okay. I think you were looking at the quarter.", "Vivien Azer", "I was.", "Dave Dunnewald", "On a constant currency basis, there was a bit of a disconnect. I can't really give you a forecast on that, but there are a lot of moving parts within the business units, and different things denominated in different currencies and that sort of thing.", "Vivien Azer", "Got it. And sticking with Europe, your guidance for single-digit inflation in terms of COGS per hectoliter, you're coming off a pretty deflationary 2015. So what's going to drive that inflection? Is it just the comp itself, or is there something else going on?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Let me take the headline on that and David can add some additional color if we need to. The Europe guidance being up low single digits versus, I think it was down low single digits last year, one of the big drivers of that was last year, we had two major contracts going away, both of which, how do you say, reduced the dollars on the COGS line. By the way, they also reduce the dollars on net sales revenue line, as well.", "But without having any impact on the volume. So if you're looking at COGS per hectoliter, then the dollars last year went down, partially due to those contracts. David, is there anything else you would add in Europe, specifically related to last year versus this year on the COGS?", "David Heede", "Yes. So in terms of commodity pricing, commodity pricing has fallen, but we do have hedging programs in place, which has dampened that effect. Commodity pricing is a relatively small part of COGS in Europe, and Central Europe in particular. So those other costs are increasing.", "What I would just draw your attention to, in addition to what Dave mentioned around the contract sales, we are trying to premiumize the portfolio, so an example of that would be quarterly going into the UK, and at the same time, we are trying to fund higher premiumization of our portfolio, along with innovation. So that's all within that low single-digit increase.", "Vivien Azer", "That's very helpful. Thanks a bunch.", "Dave Dunnewald", "Thanks, Vivien. One other thing I was going to add is when I look at the constant currency percent change on sales versus pretax, I really don't see much difference at all. So I think -- anyway, but there are a lot of moving parts, as I mentioned earlier, when you're working your way from net sales down to pretax in Europe.", "Vivien Azer", "Definitely. We'll do our best on the currencies. Cross our fingers", "Dave Dunnewald", "And we'll do our best to help. Thanks, Vivien.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore. Your line is open.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Great. Thank you very much. I was just wondering if you could revisit with us your long-term plans, in terms of giving cash back to shareholders. Once this transaction is consummated, you're going to be generating enormous amounts of cash. Obviously, you're going to have some deleveraging. You ought to be able to delever pretty quickly.", "Number one, roughly, how long do you think you'll keep the dividend flat? And going forward, do you -- would you go back to your old policy of growing the dividend with EBITDA, I believe? How should we think about long-term return of cash to shareholders between dividends and share buybacks?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Thanks, Robert. Let's see, so our approach to capital allocation has not changed. We still have the same three buckets we've been talking about for years. We have the first one being returning cash to shareholders. Second, balance sheet strength. Third, growth opportunities.", "MillerCoors is clearly in the last bucket growth opportunity. Second bucket, balance sheet, with the financing associated with the MillerCoors transaction, assuming completion in the second half of this year. That's going to be a primary area of focus for us for a while. First bucket of returning cash to shareholders, as you know, we suspended our buyback program for now, and we also have said that we're going to hold our cash quarterly dividend at the rate that it currently is, for the time being. So to your specific question, we said until our debt repayment is well under way, and I guess, beyond that -- I'm sorry. You have mentioned what about the old target of annual trailing EBITDA payout ratio. We have had that in place for, what, a couple of years now, and we are suspending that for the time being, again, while we focus primarily on paying down debt. And we'll revisit both things like the dividend and the payout ratio and buybacks at the appropriate time. But right now, we need to focus primarily on paying down debt.", "That is not to the exclusion of the other bucket obviously, because we're maintaining the dividend, and we have said that we will continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions, for example, in the last bucket as needed, as well, and we need to make sure that our pensions are properly funded, although you can tell by the numbers we mentioned earlier that they are at approximately 97% funded status at this point. Does that help?", "Robert Ottenstein", "Not really, but I guess that's probably all you can say at this point.", "Dave Dunnewald", "Yes, I think -- sorry, Robert. You're right. In other words, I can't tell you exactly when we'll get back.", "Robert Ottenstein", "I understand. I don't mean to give you a hard time. I appreciate where you're coming from.", "Dave Dunnewald", "Great.", "David Heede", "Robert, its David speaking. Our focus will be deleveraging, and the reason that is our focus is, it's very important to us that we retain that investment-grade status. So in the near term, that will be our priority.", "Dave Dunnewald", "And the other thing, Robert, I would add, while I can't tell you exactly what our timing will be in the future, I think you have a pretty good sense of what our priorities are, and a pretty good sense of our track record. For example, coming out of the StarBev transaction, the kinds of debt levels we have, the kinds of -- I think we've put some real energy around a disciplined, balanced approach to returning cash to shareholders, while still growing the business and ensuring that our balance sheet is strong. If you look at some of the steps in the last few years coming out of the StarBev transaction, I think you'll at least see how we think about these things.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Brett Cooper of Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.", "Brett Cooper", "A couple of quick ones. I think in the past you've given this to us. Can you give us the break-out generally of pension expansion, COGS, and MG&A?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Yes. It varies by the business unit because pension follows the people, and so we don't give specific numbers. But yes, if you think about where the labor sits, so for example, in the U.S. business, you're going to have greater exposure to -- sorry, a higher percent of the total pension expense flowing through COGS, and in some places in Europe, for example, you would have a higher percentage going through MG&A, because you have a bunch of entreed [ph] sales people that are in the legacy pension plan there, for example.", "But we can't give you specific percentages. There have been some indications in the 10-K in previous years, when there were pension curtailments and so forth. You could look for those. It will vary quite a bit by segment.", "Brett Cooper", "Okay. One thing I just want to check on Canada, when you gave the STR numbers, that's on a comparable basis for selling days, right?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Right. We did not mention any selling day differences when we provided the Canada STR number. All we did was give you a view that excluded the Miller brands because obviously that's a change in business.", "Brett Cooper", "But in theory, there's one less day in January, right? I'm wondering, the U.S. number you always give is selling day adjustments. I just wanted to know what you did in Canada.", "Dave Dunnewald", "Well, we generally give selling day adjusted numbers in the US, and that's it. Generally speaking, we don't adjust the other businesses. But you're right. Sometimes there's -- there are some differences in when for example our customers can either -- well, when they could buy the beer, or depending on which province you're in, for example, whether it's Ontario or Quebec, or when we can ship the beer to retailers, if you're talking about -- that would be Quebec and then Ontario would actually be consumer impact.", "So there can be some variations there. I guess what I would say is, whenever you're looking at a short time period, like January, only for a couple of the business units we tried to give you a little bit more, five weeks, that those short time periods can have a great deal of volatility, and not only because of things like how the days line up in the calendar, which they do matter, actually, to weather, for example. Or the timing of the Super Bowl. That was actually a large impact in the U.S. business, not in the numbers we gave you, because we gave you the numbers through the Super Bowl, both years. If we only look at January, that would have been a significant factor.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Vivien Azer of Cowen. Your line is open.", "Vivien Azer", "A little bit of a nitpickier question, but in Mark's prepared remarks in the press release, he said positive net pricing globally, as well as in most of our major markets. Is there a callout where you didn't get positive pricing?", "Dave Dunnewald", "Well, we did get positive net pricing, as you're aware, in MillerCoors. You also know that we got some positive pricing in Europe. We talked about that, and in Canada. Those would all be in local currency. But within some of those markets and within some of our other -- like the MCI business, there are some markets where we've got some mix impacts, and so forth. So there are some countries within those units that, well, specifically in places like Europe and MCI, where we did not have positive pricing.", "Vivien Azer", "Okay. That's fair.", "Dave Dunnewald", "We don't identify specific countries by price, for example.", "Vivien Azer", "But wherever you didn't get the positive price, you feel like that's transitory in nature? Or is there one market that's structurally challenged from either a pricing or a mix perspective?", "Dave Dunnewald", "I would say that we're not concerned with the pricing in those markets that were negative. As you know, we've had a lot of challenges in Serbia, for example, related to things like floods and the economy and a few competitive brands sorts of challenges and so forth. That's a market where I think we're in a much better place than we were a couple of years ago, and we're working, we feel good about where we are in all the countries, even the ones where we've got some pricing challenges. That's just life in the global beer business.", "Vivien Azer", "Sure, sure. And then just last one, on MCI, how do we think about the cadence on the, not necessarily startup costs, but you called out higher investments in newer markets. I assume that's in part Colombia. How do we think about the phasing that over the course of 2016?", "Dave Dunnewald", "In Colombia, we're not going to be able to give you specifics on how we phase intros into markets, but Colombia is an important South American beer market. The weather there has less seasonality to it than places like Canada, so that's a good thing. But we'll manage the investment in, for example, Colombia, within the context of the overall MCI plan, which includes getting to profitability, less FX since 2013, but getting the profitability in 2016.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have no further audio questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Dunnewald.", "Dave Dunnewald", "Great. Thanks, Lori. In closing, I would like to thank all of you for your interest in Molson Coors, and for joining us today. If you have additional questions that we did not cover during our time today, please call Kevin Kim or me on our direct lines, or at the main line at Molson Coors, which is 303-927-BEER or 927-2337.

Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (NYSE:USA), Inc.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Operator", "Welcome to the Molson Coors Brewing Company First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today, so please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.", "The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website www.molsoncoors.com and click on the financial reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.", "Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in U.S. dollars.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Connor. Hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. And thanks for joining us today.", "With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have: Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, our CEO in Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, the CEO of our International Business; Sam Walker, our Global Chief People and Legal Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; Dave Dunnewald, VP of Investor Relations; and David Heede, who has very ably filled the role of Interim Global CFO for the past six months, as we've completed our search for a permanent CFO. David is now transitioning back to his role as our Europe CFO as we welcome our new Global CFO, Mauricio Restrepo, who joined Molson Coors yesterday and he is here with us this morning.", "And for our earnings call today, David and I will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2016 results for the Molson Coors Brewing Company along with some perspectives on the balance of 2016.", "In the first quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger brand portfolio, delivering value-added innovation, strengthening our core brand positionings through incremental marketing investments, and continuing to premiumize our portfolio.", "We began to see the benefits flow to our top-line performance as we grew worldwide volume, improved core brand momentum in key markets, introduced fast-growing innovations in all of our businesses, and achieved Above Premium growth globally including in craft, flavored malt beverages and cider. We also significantly expanded gross, operating, and pre-tax margins globally and increased total company underlying after-tax earnings more than 28%, while growing underlying EBITDA more than 15% versus a year ago.", "At the same time, we completed a common stock offering in January to fund about 20% of the pending MillerCoors transaction. And we made solid progress in our planning for the integration of MillerCoors and the Miller global brand portfolio. Completion of this game-changing transaction is still expected in the second half of this year and we intend to be ready to go on day one following the close.", "In brands, Coors Light grew volume 3.5% globally including strong double-digit growth in the U.K. and Ireland and high-single-digit growth in Latin America. In Above Premium, our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar and the broader Sharp's portfolio in the U.K., Creemore and Granville Island in Canada, Blue Moon Belgian White in the U.S., and in the U.K., and its sister brand Belgian Moon in Canada, and also the newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S.", "In ciders, we grew volume of Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. And in flavored malt beverages, introduction of Henry's Hard Soda is proceeding well ahead of expectations and driving incremental Above Premium volume for us in the U.S.", "We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, we increased efficiency of our operations, and we implemented common global systems. To ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, we completed the sale of our Vancouver Brewery in Canada for C$185 million and we'll lease the brewery back from the buyer as we build a new, more efficient, and flexible brewery. We also gained agreement to the closure of Burton South Brewery in the U.K., allowing us to further consolidate U.K. brewing operations.", "Regional highlights for the first quarter are as follows: In the U.S., underlying equity income increased 22.1% from a year ago, driven by higher net pricing, positive sales mix, timing of shipments and lower cost of goods sold. Coors Light and Miller Lite each gained share of the U.S. Premium Light segment for the fourth consecutive quarter, with both brands achieving flat sales to retail volume for the first time in MillerCoors' history.", "Improved momentum for these two brands was driven by ongoing improvements to their consumer communications, which appeals to a broad cross-section of men and women, Millennials, and multi-cultural consumers. Coors Banquet remains only national premium beer in the category that continues to grow. In the higher margin Above Premium segment, our lead craft brand, Blue Moon Belgian White, delivered another quarter of growth, as did Leinenkugel's Grapefruit Shandy and our newly acquired Saint Archer brands.", "In FMBs, we achieved strong initial results from the introduction of Henry's Hard Sodas in the first quarter. And according to Nielsen, Henry's Hard Orange Soda has the best velocity of any hard soda since the fourth week of its launch, and Henry's Hard Ginger Ale Soda is the number one Ginger Ale in this fast growing segment.", "In Canada, we delivered strong earnings growth, but our top-line performance was lower in both volume and revenue per hectoliter. In brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian both had a challenging quarter, and we're taking additional concrete steps to improve performance in the balance of the year, which I'll discuss in a few minutes.", "In Above Premium and craft, Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack Apple Lager, Heineken and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter along with our Creemore and Granville craft brands.", "In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pre-tax income increased 25.2% in constant currency, primarily due to a timing-led reduction in distribution costs, some lower pension expenses, and results of our ongoing cost savings initiatives.", "These factors were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and higher brand investments. Excluding the impact of the loss of the Miller brands, Canada STRs declined 1.6%, but including the Miller brands, STRs declined 5.2%. Increased competitor trade spend and pricing activities, especially in Qu\u00e9bec and the West region, led to overall softer volume.", "In Europe, earnings were lower in the quarter primarily due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangement in the U.K. Notwithstanding, our business and our brands performed well across the region.", "We increased market share and we continue to premiumize our portfolio and reduce costs. We grew volume in seven of the 11 countries and for seven of our lead core and premium brands in the region. In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier, and O\u017eujsko grew share of segment in their primary markets.", "Our Above Premium portfolio increased momentum with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light and the craft portfolio, including Doom Bar and the other Sharp's brands.", "Additionally, our cider portfolio achieved strong growth with the inclusion of Rekorderlig since the middle of 2015. And the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the U.K. also added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio.", "Our International business improved pre-tax performance in the first quarter, driven by continued volume growth in Latin America, India, and Japan, as well as lower marketing and overhead expenses due to the substantial restructure of our China business last year. Coors Light grew at a high-single-digit rate in international markets due to our launch in Colombia, as well as growth in our existing Latin America markets.", "Now I'll turn over to David to give first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. David?", "David Heede - Chief Financial Officer-Europe Region", "Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody. Our first quarter financial headlines are as follows.", "Headline net sales increased 0.1% on a constant currency basis, driven by 1.2% growth in worldwide volume. Including foreign currency movements, net sales were down approximately 6% in U.S. dollars.", "Our net sales per hectoliter decreased 1.9% in constant currency, due to negative mix in Canada and lower Heineken contract brewing volume in Europe.", "Underlying after-tax income increased 28.1% to a $110.3 million or $0.54 per share driven by worldwide volume growth and lower cost of goods sold.", "On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $159.3 million, which is nearly double the prior year result. In addition to the factors that drove higher underlying income, this increase was primarily due to $110.4 million gain on the sale of our Vancouver brewery at the end of the first quarter, partially offset by special charges related to brewery closures. Please note that we received the cash from the Vancouver brewery sale on the first day of the second quarter.", "Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $263.4 million, a 15.2% increase from a year ago.", "We issued 29.9 million shares Class B common stock from our equity offering in January for approximately $2.5 billion of net proceeds, which will fund about 20% of the $12 billion pending MillerCoors transaction.", "Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of business unit financial results in the quarter.", "Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, and cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.6 billion, resulting in a net debt of just over $400 million, which is significantly lower than prior year due to the proceeds received from our equity offering earlier this year.", "Looking forward to the remainder of 2016, our strong first quarter results were aided by the timing of Easter holiday and the additional days sales as a result of 2016 being the leap year, along with relatively favorable cost comparisons in the U.S. and lower Canada distribution costs.", "We anticipate that our results will not benefit from most of these factors in the balance of this year. Other trends to consider over the last three quarters of this year include: higher investments in our brands this year, including a double-digit increase globally in the second quarter, leading into peak season in the U.S., Canada, and Europe; incremental Europe brand amortization expense with an annualized impact of approximately $15 million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015 along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year; a total prohibition on the sale of alcohol, unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar, India, in early April.", "We don't know how long this ban will be in place and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business until it is resolved, as this is our largest state of operation in India. Note, however, that this prohibition in Bihar has no impact on the Mount Shivalik business in India that we purchased last year; the impact of terminated contracts which are now nearly all behind this; and finally, foreign currency translation, which, at current exchange rates, would not be a significant factor in our underlying pre-tax results this year. This view has improved significantly since our February earnings call, because of the recent strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the U.S. dollar. Given the recent volatility of key foreign currencies, however, it is important to watch these rates closely.", "Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all guidance measures. For the full year, we expect cash contributions to our defined pension funds to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including a 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense; capital spending of approximately $300 million; MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million as we invest more behind innovation and commercial excellence this year; consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million; and underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, or adjustments to uncertain tax provisions.", "Regarding free cash flow guidance, we still have a large number of dynamic factors in play in relation to cash use and capital deployment, principally due to the pending MillerCoors transaction and, therefore, we plan to issue 2016 underlying free cash flow guidance later in the year with the goal of removing some of the recent volatility to guidance that has occurred.", "As far as cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at low-single-digit rate for the full year 2016; we now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to be approximately in line with prior year; lower than expected pricing for diesel, aluminum, and corn, as well as acceleration in some of our cost savings initiatives drove the change from previous guidance of up low-single-digits; we now expect our International COGS per hectoliter in local currency to increase at the high-single-digit rate for 2016. This is up from low-single-digits previously due to geographic mix changes; we continue to expect cost savings for the next two years to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors, as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by the year four following the transaction close.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of businesses early in the second quarter, which are impacted by the early timing of Easter this year. In the U.S. and Canada, for the three weeks through April 23, sales to retail decreased at mid-single-digit rates. In Europe, volume through to April 25 decreased low-single-digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, through to April 23 decreased at a double-digit rate, partially due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India.", "As ever, please keep in mind, these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also note that, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing early next quarter volumes.", "At this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, David. In 2016, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play. As we move into peak season this year, we're seeing additional competitive pricing pressure and we intend to step-up our brand investments significantly, particularly in the second quarter. In the U.S., there has been a great deal of change in MillerCoors over the past 10 months. Those changes were necessary to create the foundation for the volume growth we aim to achieve by 2019.", "As we work to close the transaction, MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive, and accountable for growing the business, transforming its portfolio, and driving value for our shareholders. In American Light Lagers, we continued to gain momentum behind the revitalization of our two largest U.S. brands, Coors Light and Miller Lite. In Above Premium, we continue to develop higher-margin offerings that can scale and stick, including strong early results from the launch of Henry's Hard Orange and Ginger Ale Sodas and we'll introduce a cherry cola flavor later this year.", "We've also made the decision to offer our fastest-growing Leinenkugel's extension, Grapefruit Shandy, on a year-round basis to strengthen the Leinenkugel's brand family, which alongside Blue Moon Belgian White forms the base of a formidable craft portfolio. In cider, we're broadening the appeal of Smith & Forge Hard Cider by adding a bottle package to our lineup.", "We'll continue to build First Choice customer partnerships with our Building with Beer retail strategy, which leverages the higher velocity and broad appeal of American Light Lagers. We plan to expand this valuable tool beyond the on-premise to additional channels in the balance of this year.", "In Canada, the restructuring of our brand portfolio was largely complete and gaining traction. In the first quarter, we achieved strong volume growth behind both Coors Banquet and Pilsner. We also continue to see strong momentum for our craft brands, Creemore and Granville Island, as well as in our Mexican portfolio with Sol and Dos Equis and in flavored malt beverages with Mad Jack.", "At the end of the quarter, we launched Mad Jack Root Beer and Ginger Ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. We continue to focus on accelerating growth for our core brands Coors Light and Molson Canadian as our biggest opportunity and challenge. Coors Light brand health has improved behind our North American packaging update, which continued to roll out in the first quarter, along with high impact retail executions that drove positive momentum in social engagement.", "For Molson Canadian, following another successful #anythingforhockey campaign in the first quarter, we'll continue in peak season with strong programming and new communications that celebrates all of the rich qualities of our beer and our Canadian identity.", "Operationally, we continue on our mission to be First Choice for consumers and customers focusing on our Field Sales Management program to deliver brilliant store-level execution across space, assortment, and pricing.", "In 2016, we will also continue to restructure our supply chain to ensure we are fit for the future. The sale of our Vancouver brewery for C$185 million at the end of the first quarter was a significant first step towards allowing us to build a more efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years.", "In Europe, we achieved solid top-line performance in the first quarter on the strength of our core brands and the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the U.K. Although, the increased brand amortization expense will present a headwind for the next couple of quarters, we will continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to grow share of segment. In fact, earlier today, we announced the signing of a global Carling sponsorship as the official beer partner of the English Premier League. This sponsorship reaches well beyond Carling in the U.K., as it allows us to leverage any brand in any market with one of the most popular sports properties globally.", "We'll also continue to premiumize our portfolio with Coors Light, the Sharp's portfolio led by Doom Bar, Ireland's leading craft brand, Franciscan Well, Cobra, Rekorderlig, and Staropramen. And to ensure that our supply chain is fit for future, the planned closure of our Burton South Brewery in the U.K. is progressing well, along with the transition of production to our recently modernized Burton North Brewery by the end of 2017.", "Our International business is focused on attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant currency basis versus 2013 foreign exchange rates when we originally made this commitment, and continue to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets.", "Upon closing of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy, and allows us to gain entrance into high priority markets, while increasing our business scale in current markets.", "We also intend to continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America, including the high potential Colombia market, where we launched at the end of last year. Going forward, we expect the Coors, Miller, and Staropramen brands to form the backbone of our international portfolio. In India, we will continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business, which we acquired last year as we developed contingency plans related to the Bihar alcohol prohibition.", "To wrap up, in the balance of 2016, we'll continue to focus on our First Choice for consumers and customer \u2013 customer's ambition all driven through our PACC lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference with a couple of hours this afternoon. Also 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website.", "Additionally, in the next two months, we hope to see many of you at two events. Firstly, we will hold our Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Wednesday May 25, 2016 here in Denver. And second, we'll host our Annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at New York Exchange on the afternoon of Wednesday, June 8, 2016.", "Finally, I want to offer a thank you to David Heede, who has capably led the finance function over the past almost six months.", "So, at this point, Connor, we'd like to open up for questions, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Vivien.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So, I was hoping we could dig in on Canada a little bit. Two questions please. The first on the negative mix shift, and how we should think about that evolving, because clearly you are having a fair amount of success at the Above Premium price points where you're putting some notable investment, so kind of the offset there and how we think about that evolving. On the earlier call, we discussed a little bit with Gavin, the outlook for U.S. beer and perhaps that U.S beer would not lose share in the U.S. relative to other competitive alcoholic beverage categories. So, if you could put in that context, that would be helpful. That's my first question on Canada. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, I'll pass across to Stewart. Stewart, do you want to set that question just in the context of the kind of transformational agenda that you're leading for in Canada.", "Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah, cheers. Thanks for that, Vivien. Well, look, I think if you look at where we've been going with our portfolio, our focus has been on developing the top end and we're really pleased with the way that the Above Premium brands are gaining share in the marketplace. If you look at our NSR in total, the underlying increase in NSR is close to about 1%, and the mix that we're talking about is really being driven by two items; one is the loss of Miller and the other is the impact of our contract brewing revenues which impact the top line, but don't impact the volume. So, I would focus on the 1% is what fits underneath the real performance.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. And any comment on the outlook for the beer category relative to some of the other alcoholic beverage categories in Canada?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Stewart, do you want to follow-up on that?", "Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "No. I mean I don't have the most recent data for the first quarter; it will be out next week. I think that the broad trends that we have seen in the last couple of years have seen wine gaining share. Spirits hasn't been a major factor for us in Canada. I would step back and look at the health of the beer industry. I think the first quarter had the benefit, obviously, of an extra trading day and Easter, but broadly this quarter has felt healthier than previous years, number one.", "Number \u2013 with number two, I would point out, that there are the challenges in Canada that we saw in the fourth quarter, we're limited really to Qu\u00e9bec and to Alberta. In this past quarter, I think the most challenging market remained Alberta, but the rest of the industry looks healthy.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Vivien, the only thing I would add to that is I think if you look at what's has happening on macro level within the beer industry in Canada than consumers generally are choosing to invest their hard earned dollars in some of the higher-priced segments, whether that's craft or Above Premium and imports, the exception to that really has been in Alberta where, obviously, that economy is under a lot of pressure with what we've seen from the oil industry, but not dissimilar to what we've in the U.S. where in a relatively benign volume market that the areas of real consumer momentum tend to be in imports, higher-priced segments like FMBs and craft.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Terrific. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Judy, how are you?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So I wanted to ask about Europe. I think the quarter had a pretty decent volume growth, but there was some timing benefit, so just wanted to get a sense of what's happening from a category growth standpoint in some of your key markets, your market share performance? And maybe just, broadly speaking, as you think about certainly MillerCoors becoming a bigger portion of your business going forward, how does sort of Europe fit into your broader strategy and your attempt to kind of grow and accelerate the profit growth in that region?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Judy. I think there was a couple of questions in there. So, Simon, why don't you take the first part of the question and just talk a little bit about the momentum we're seeing in our Europe business and then I'll touch on the impact of MillerCoors more broadly?", "Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Thank you, Judy. So, if you look to that top-line results, Judy, then our volumes grew by just over 5% in Europe in the quarter and that translated into just over 4% top-line on net sales revenue growth if you extract currency changes. So, we were very pleased with that. We think that's a very, very solid performance.", "And to answer your question and give that some context, the markets in which we operate were pretty much flat from a volume perspective. So, in other words, we gained share and we would calculate that to be about an 0.6% or 0.7% share gain across the quarter, which again I think is very solid. And I think, pleasingly, it's share gain driven by the majority of our countries, by the majority of our main brands, and we also saw some pretty good trends on our premium brands.", "So, overall, if you're looking for our performance in the context to the market, good performance on volume, strong performance on revenue, good share gain and a good shape to the portfolio growth as well.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Simon. Judy, any follow-up for Simon specifically before I talk about MillerCoors?", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "No. I'm good with Simon. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Simon. And then, Judy, just to your broader question about Europe and the impact of MillerCoors, as business as usual we've got a big business and it'll be a bigger business in the U.S. We have a big business in Canada. We've got a fast-growing International business and we have a big business in Europe. And we want all of our businesses to be focused on top-line growth.", "The European business will have the additional benefit of, in particular, the MGD volumes in the U.K. and Ireland, but it'll be very much business as usual, and I think the opportunity is on that enhanced platform, how we can lift and shift some of our faster growing brands, so brands like the Sharp's portfolio or Franciscan Well, and really leverage them and more broadly internationally. So, very much business as usual. I think you've seen solid improvements and a competitive position in Europe, and we'll continue down that path going forward. Europe is a big part of our overall business and is an important part of our business.", "Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Judy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I guess Mauricio and Mark, one question for \u2013 or kind of two-part question for you and then also on the subject of Canada, but Mauricio or really Mark I guess, what are Mauricio's priorities, now that he is the new CFO? And then, Mauricio, you come with the experience from Beam and is there anything special about that experience that you think pertains to the job at hand for Molson Coors?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, so let me pickup Mauricio's job description and his goal setting conversation, which will take place probably later this week. I anticipate this being a very seamless transition. We are delighted that Mauricio has joined our business. He's got great experience in both developed and developing markets and across the alcohol sector broadly. And I think he'll come in and be provocative and added value on a number of fronts.", "So, I mean, the short-term priorities are pretty clear and I think we've been consistent on that, Mark, which is we've got to deliver our 2016 plan, make sure that we are delivering both top-line, bottom-line and the strong cash performance and be prepared to go when the deal is approved and then subsequently close this (31:57) in relation to MillerCoors and Miller International and Mauricio is going to play a very explicit part on that agenda. It's really no more complicated than that. I don't know, Mauricio, if you want to say, hi and offer any further perspectives.", "Mauricio Restrepo Pinto - Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Thank you, Mark and Mark. With one full day under by belt, I guess \u2013 what I can say is that, I'm very excited to be here at Molson Coors. It is a company with outstanding people and great brand portfolio, and it's really a very exciting time for the company. And I'll be essentially focusing on furthering the strategy of the company which is to delight the world's beer consumers with our products. As Mark said, offering hopefully some interesting points of view in terms of my experience in the spirits industry and formerly at SABMiller. That being said, I look forward to seeing and meeting most if not all of you in person at our event in New York in early June.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's great. Okay. Thank you for that. And if I could also on Canada and Mark or Stewart, I guess I want to focus particularly on Coors Light and Molson Canadian and what I'm \u2013 what I'd like to better understand is why we really are coming around the corner, because we've been coming around the corner for quite some time with these two brands. And it sounds like you feel a little better, but \u2013 and I guess you're going to be spending more, and so that in itself is real. But what are you seeing that makes you think that maybe it's not second quarter, maybe it's 2017. These brands really are in a better position than they've been because I appreciate you've been working hard on correcting the issue, but it's still an issue and the U.S. is improving, Molson Canadian is not a U.S. brand of any size, but it's hard from where we sit, at least from where I sit, to believe that anything meaningful is going to change for those two brands anytime soon. So can you give us a little bit more on what's going on there?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So let me offer \u2013 let me offer a little bit of context. And then Stewart, do you want to just talk about some of the specifics I think are building confidence? But, if you look across our business, Mark, whether that's Coors Light and Miller Lite in the U.S., whether it's the way that Carling's got back into share of segment growth over the last couple of years in the U.K., I think we've got a track record of where we've seen new challenges in our business, continuing to work that challenge, and put in place the right response.", "And I think the most recent trends in the U.S. on our two biggest brands demonstrate our ability to get focused with the right inputs in place. And I mean these are big, big brands. It's like driving a -captaining an oil tanker, it doesn't turnaround overnight, but you've got to remain resolute and focused on the right inputs. We've demonstrated that in the U.S. We've demonstrated that in other markets. In all honesty, we had a couple of misfires on some of our consumer communication in Canada. But, I think Stewart and the team have really got to grips with what's required now, and are feeling very good about the quality of our communications that we've got in the marketplace. But, Stewart do you want to just talk about a few more of the specifics that are building confidence as we go into Q2 and in Q3, in particular?", "Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah, sure, Mark. I'd actually just, Mark, just step back one second and just say, that as we looked at our strategic plan three years ago. We really built out three big blocks; one was redoing our supply chain footprint, the other was lowering our G&A cost base, and the third was improving our commercial capability and portfolio.", "And those are relevant. Why? Because on the cost base and the supply chain, the savings that we're getting from that has allowed us to start to feed the investments required to get the brands going.", "On the brand side, we're really focused on making sure that we had a portfolio that was right for consumers. And on the Above Premium, which is where we built up all the brands, we're performing well and we're really happy with those brands.", "On Molson Canadian and on Coors Light, those brands sit in the mainstream. That is the part of the market that is under the most pressure. And if you looked at this past quarter, Canadian held share of the segment and Coors Light did not. So, Coors Light is where our real challenge is.", "I've been pretty clear about calling out where the challenges are for Coors Light, those being our need to improve our brand scores. Our need to reach out to millennials and to engage those consumers more actively in our brands. I think when you look at the first quarter from a costs standpoint, our G&A costs went down, and we spent some of that money back in the brand. So, that's moving our strategy.", "I think it gives the brand itself, we saw finally the introduction of some marketing that is working. Our advertising is scoring better than any of the campaigns we've seen over the last three years or four years, that's a positive, and we're seeing an uptick in our brand equity. So, those are positives.", "I think if you look at the activity that we have for the second quarter and the call out that we made in the earning release and the script this morning, we pointed to the fact that we expect to put more money behind the brands and that is because we have a pretty full activation agenda, we've got a full advertising agenda and we know that we need to spend some money to get the energy going on these brands. So, that's where we are. And I think you'll be in a position in June to hear more from us and to see some of that work when we meet in New York.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's actually very helpful. One quick follow-up. Is there any history or what does the history say about the relationship between the U.S. and Canada for the brand Coors Light? The U.S. is seeing this improvement. Is there a historical analogue to make you believe that you can get some tailwind, so to speak, off of that with this added spending you're going to be doing for the brand in Canada?", "Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "I'm not sure whether there is a strong correlation between the markets is because the development of the brands has been a little bit different. But what I will say is that, we've been working well together as a North American group to understand what drives our consumers. You will see us leveraging more ideas back and forth between the two business units. And in fact, here in the next few weeks, you will see us starting to use some of that U.S. messaging.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Great. Thank you, Stewart. Thanks, Mark.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Your line is open.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Good morning, everyone. Look, I mean, just two quick questions. The first one Mark, in very general terms, 10 months after \u2013 almost six months, seven months after that we know the MillerCoors transaction, do you have more, the same or less conviction about the guidance with $100 million synergies? So, if you can answer that and maybe give some color in terms of why?", "And then the second question related to these questions you had, in global terms, after the transaction has closed, MillerCoors, the U.S. market is going to be about 80% of your earnings. What about trying to diversify the regional profile of the company later on. Is that a priority, or it doesn't matter at all?", "And the reason I ask that obviously is when you hear news about Anheuser-Busch InBev trying to sell their assets in Poland and Czech Republic, are those potential assets that could be of interest to your company? Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Hi, Pablo. Thanks for the questions. To your specific question on the synergy target, I would say having done the planning, I'm more convicted or convinced, that's the right word with regard to the number, but clearly I don't want to talk in any more specifics. I have been pretty clear that once our planning team have finished all of the planning work and we get deal approval and we're moving towards close, then we can update more specifically at that point. But, I think the gains that we offered last November as we work through the planning stands good and we'll update more broadly in due course.", "From your question with regard to the center of gravity that would be our business being the U.S. Our overall strategy doesn't change, we will have a bigger position in the U.S. and you know that has many benefits associated with it.", "But, we've been on the journey to build a footprint over the course of the last five years, in particular, led by Coors Light and more recently by Staropramen and that will continue. I'm not going to comment specifically on any M&A opportunities. We never do, as you're aware. But we need to play to win in both the U.S., Canada, and in our European business. And we need to continue to build our global footprint, led through our global brands, that's principally been on an asset-light license and export model. It's likely that model will continue as we look to take Coors trademark, Staropramen trademark in the future of the Miller trademark into more markets, that's probably all I can say at this stage.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yeah. That's fine. Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Pablo.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning, everyone.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Bryan.", "Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Good morning, Bryan.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a couple of short questions. First, in terms of the two breweries that the sale in Vancouver and then the plans to close in Eden. On Vancouver, are there any timing provisions? I guess, you know, if it takes you a while to find a property or find a location or build a brewery, are there any sort of timing provisions we should think about, in terms of when that lease term ends, or are there any timing provisions we should think about there?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Just on Vancouver?", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just on Vancouver, yeah.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Stewart, do you want to just give a little bit of color on Vancouver?", "Stewart F. Glendinning - President & Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors Canada, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. Sure. Bryan, as you point out, we closed the deal this quarter. In terms of the timeline, we have up to five years. So, we've got plenty of time to find and build a new brewery. And, of course, that process is actively underway already.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then in Eden, have you disclosed yet what the plans are for that property, once you close it? Have you \u2013 will it continue, will you sell it? Will it continue to operate as a brewery under someone else's ownership? Just any thoughts on yet, in terms of what happens to that brewery, kind of post closing it?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The very specific response, Bryan, is that, no, we haven't disclosed anything in relation to Eden other than our plan to close the brewery. And Gavin and the team are working through the process at this point in time, and it's going as anticipated. I don't know whether, Gavin, you'd want to add anything to that?", "Gavin Hattersley - Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors LLC", "No, Mark, other than to say, we just haven't made a decision as to what to do with the facility and land, at this point in time, as you correctly stated.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And just the reason why I asked the question is just, you've got a lot of capacity that's being added to the industry from the craft beer industry, and the capacity that Constellation is adding in Mexico is essentially U.S. brewing capacity. So, I'm just trying to get a sense for whether or not just the capacity in the industry at all overall sort of affects your decision-making in terms of what you might decide to do?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I think, Gavin, do you want to pick up on that?", "Gavin Hattersley - Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors LLC", "Yeah, I was going to say, Bryan, we're focused on the moment of closing the brewery down and transitioning the volume to where it's supposed to be. That's our focus, here. And we just haven't made any decisions on what to do with a facility or the land at this point.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, just the last one, and I might have missed this earlier. But just in Canada this quarter, the distribution, the lower distribution costs, what was that related to, specifically?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, look, I can give you a headline on that, Bryan. COGS performance in the first quarter was very, very encouraging, probably about half of the COGS improvement related to some timing benefit and that relates specifically just to some distribution charge and the timing of those distribution costs.", "I think if you work on the basis, about half of the COGS improvement as underlying and continuing and about half of the COGS improvement in the first quarter or something that will fall away because it was a timing benefit \u2013 I don't think we whether want to get into any more of the specifics at this stage.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Bryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thank you very much. Could you talk a little bit about how Coors Light is doing globally? I'm guessing there was some impact in terms of what was happening in India, so perhaps maybe kind of a number, a volume number for Coors Light globally, taking India into account?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Rob. It's Mark here. Just a couple of comments for you. Firstly, Coors Light isn't available in India, so no issues there. I don't think, Kandy has got any plans to launch in India, hasn't spoken to me, I've heard it. So, Coors Light globally was up about 3.5% and across Europe and our international business, we were close to 19% growth.", "So, we're seeing very, very strong performance as we take the brand outside of North America, a tremendous traction and velocity and growth in Central and South America. And a brand which has become our second largest brand in our UK and Ireland portfolio and has grown to well over a million hectoliters now across the UK and Ireland.", "So, in a number of international markets, but I wouldn't describe it is having a global footprint, center of gravity outside of North America, certainly, Central and South America and our UK and Ireland business. And strong and growing momentum behind the Coors Light brand.", "Alongside that, we've introduced Coors 1873 into a couple of markets, as a sister brand of Coors Banquet. And again, we've seen that performed strongly, so we're looking to build out the Coors trademark and that proof-of-concept in Coors 1873, I think, gives us some signals as to how we can build that trademark more broadly going forward.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "I just want to make sure I got those numbers right. So globally, including U.S. up 3.5%, and outside of the U.S., up 19%?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "In Europe and MCI combined, it's just under 19% growth.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "Okay, so outside of North America. That's terrific.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "And as you're going to look to take control of the Miller brands globally, how would you compare, do you think, the potential for those brands with Coors? And how are you thinking about positioning outside of the U.S.?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. We'll \u2013 I mean, I think we're in a great position because the positioning of the brands is very complementary, the Coors positioning is very clear in terms of begin born in the Rockies and owning the whole sense of cold refreshment. Miller is much more of an urban positioning and MGD, in particular, I think it's very complementary to Coors Light. And then, Staropramen clearly operates with a very, very strong check in our European provenance.", "In really simplistic terms, Robert, we've got a great clear bottle offering, brown bottle offering and green bottle offering, but that's me probably getting out my depth on my marketing skills. But, I think overall positionings of the brand are very complementary, it gives us more scale in a number of existing MCI markets, and it gives us an entry point into a number of new markets as well.", "So, our international business will scale up very significantly on the back of this addition to our portfolio. With what I think will be a great backbone of international brands and around that we can then start to really test our ability to build some of the international footprint for some of our craft brands as well. So, I think, we're poised for the next phase in international brand development.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And any comments on, I know it's very small, but just in terms of understanding how the portfolio is doing, and the business in Australia. And whether, is that a template for other countries?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. I'll pass that across to Kandy. Kandy, do you want to just comment on our Australia business?", "Krishnan Anand - President and Chief Executive Officer, Molson Coors International, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Sure. Thanks, Mark. Rob, as you mentioned, it's a relatively small part of our business; however, we launched there now. It's little over 18 months. We launched Coors Light, but we have to call it Coors, because of the laws there, which where lights are low alcohol beers only, so it's basically the same born in Rockies, cold refreshment that Mark referred to, but we call it Coors. It's doing well and we've had a really good summer season, we just finished in Australia in March.", "And we're looking forward to also add the Miller portfolio to that. With the two we'll actually increase our scale in Australia more than twofold with the addition of Miller. So, I would say, it's something that we believe in the long run, well, we bought a reasonable size business as well as reasonably profitable business. And it's going to take a while to grow these two brands.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Does it make sense?", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "And U.S. craft beers, are taking off in many countries. Any just final quick thoughts on early potential, early insight into Blue Moon and the ability of that brand to gain traction overseas?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think it's a good observation, Robert. And I think we've led that wave with the development of Blue Moon in a number of markets. Obviously, we've now got Belgian Moon up in Canada. Blue Moon has been in our UK and Ireland business for a number of years and is growing strongly. And Kandy and his team now have gone into a multiple markets. Australia is one of those markets, Japan is another market. And interest from around the world continues to grow, so we're already on that path and have been developing that over the course of the last three years to five years, in particular and we're seeing demand growing.", "I think we're in a strong position when you look at the number one Irish brand, the leading brand in UK with Sharp's and our Canadian brands as well. There is opportunities for us to really build out that craft portfolio at international level and that's central to some of our international expansion thinking at this point in time.", "Robert E. Ottenstein - Evercore ISI", "Terrific. Very exciting. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Robert.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Filippe Goossens with MUFG. Your line is open.", "Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.", "Yes, good morning, gentlemen. And thanks for the call this morning again. I had two questions, although I think the first one has been indirectly answered, it was more from an M&A perspective, trying to find out if there was any remote interest perhaps in the Pilsner Urquell brand that AB InBev is putting up for sale. But I'll take your comments for that on the earlier question.", "My second question, if I may, is given the Carling business in the UK, how are you seeing the potential for the Brexit potential vote next month in England? Would that cause meaningful issues for you, or that's something that is relatively managed within the scope of the operations in Europe? Thank you very much.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Filippe. So, thanks for your acknowledgement on the M&A question. I would just mention, obviously our definitive agreement with ABI is the Pilsner Urquell brand remains in our portfolio in the U.S. on a perpetual royalty-free basis. So that's in our portfolio currently and will remain in our portfolio, irrespective of what's been announced last week by ABI and SAB divestiture.", "With regard to the Carling business in the UK and Brexit, that's a great question. I think if you ask 10 commentators, you'd probably get 10 different points of view. I mean it's outside of our control, the consumer demand in the UK for Carling and our other brands, I think will remain unaffected by whatever decision is made.", "The impact on currency and any translational impact, I think is probably the thing that we're keeping our eye on it at the moment, but I don't think it will affect any real demand patterns in the UK, which is clearly what we're really interested in. I don't know Simon, whether you'd offer any more color on that, it's just such a difficult one to call, but any perspective, Simon?", "Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "No. I think it's similar to you, Mark. I mean of all the things that we should keep our eye on, it wouldn't be one of the things that necessarily keeps me awake at night. I just don't see it actually having any material impact on the overall demand in the beer market in the UK. And I certainly think based on our recent trends of Carling performance on that portfolio in the UK, we'd be able to withstand whatever effect did come. So no, I wouldn't put that in any future model of any real importance, no.", "Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.", "So, it seems then basically if there's any issue at all, it's most likely going to come from a translation perspective, as it relates to the impact on the currency, but nothing in terms of demand. Is that a fair summary?", "Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "I think, that's reasonable. Yeah.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.", "Thank you, gentlemen.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hello. Thanks. Hi, again guys. Thank you for taking this follow-up. Simon, I wanted to understand a little better what is happening in Europe, in the sense that it's clear the UK is benefiting from this introduction, and I presume you're taking some share there, and then these other markets that drove the volume increase, I presume your taking share there. Can you give us a little more sense of either the theme that's underlying share gains versus those markets where you're seeing share losses, if there is a theme? But 11 countries is a lot. Don't know that we need to go into every single one, but I'm just trying to better understand the other side of the coin, if you will. The markets where you're not having the success you'd like. That's what I'm trying to understand.", "Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Simon, do you want to answer that.", "Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. Sure. I mean, to your point, Mark, I think, we could spend a lot of the time doing individual diagnosis on 11 different countries. I think, the theme that I will point you to is that, in general, we are increasing our investments in marketing and those investments are playing out well for us with stronger volumes, stronger revenues and premiumizing that portfolio. And actually, that's a factor virtually across all the markets.", "So if for example, I took Staropramen, we are investing in Staropramen across all of our European markets, and we've also repatriated that into the UK, and we're investing behind it, and that's giving us double-digit growth almost universally, actually across those markets.", "So, there are always you know some puts and takes from a timing perspective in individual markets, but our general strategy of investing behind our core brands and investing in premiumization is working at the aggregate level in Europe and any countries that isn't true in this quarter, I'd been confident that we could continue to drive those countries back towards the norm. So, I don't think, there's actually as much variation as perhaps you might be pointing to. And I think overall, our strategy is just working in aggregate.", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "That's very helpful. And one quick follow-up. Of those markets that did not participate in the 5% volume increase, what's the largest of those markets? Countries?", "Simon Cox - President & CEO-Molson Coors Europe, Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. We don't intend to break those down. So, I wouldn't want to get into market-by-market commentary, if that's okay, Mark?", "Mark Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Sure, enough. Okay. Thank you, Simon.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Mark.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Good morning, guys. Just a quick one.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Brett.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "The pushing of near beer or FMBs continues to be an avenue of growth for you in the industry. Do you see any risk of heightened regulatory scrutiny from FMBs getting closer and closer to non-alcoholic beverages?", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Brett, let me give you just a couple of comments on that. Obviously, selling alcohol is something that you know comes with a significant obligations and we are \u2013 and all of our markets very, very careful about the way that we both introduce and market brands.", "FMBs have been a big part of our business for the last couple of decades back in the UK. We, in the mid-1990s, launched a brand called Hooch, which was you know one of the forerunners of the FMB category and it's been you know part of our business as a safer you know a couple of decades now. So, we are very careful, very responsible, very clear about the fact that these are adult drinks, they're clearly marked as adult drinks and will continue to comply with all regulations in all of our markets to build our portfolio responsibly. I think beyond that, it's probably not worth getting into any specifics. So, that's just our general philosophy in our business.", "Brett Cooper - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Brett.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Your line is open.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you for taking the follow-up. Look, Gavin, I realize I asked questions relating to MillerCoors call earlier today, but three very quick ones for you. So, is the industry traditionally, will increase prices in the fall and most of the companies would follow. Has the industry changed in that regard? And what happened really with that price increase in the fall? Did it stick or not? That's the first question.", "The second one, in the earlier call you said that pricing ex-mix was up 0.8% for the MillerCoors portfolio. Can you just give us some new ones there, in terms of what was increase in the value brands, compared to say mainstream? It seems to me that on value-price, pricing might have come down, if you can explain that.", "And then the third and last question I think that Miller High Life, it's in my opinion in a very unique position within your value portfolio. And one would think that it may be stacking between mainstream and value, and that there's an opportunity for you to have a very strong value brand, if Miller High Life were to trend down price wise into fully the value segment, as opposed to what seems to be happening, that it's moving up to mainstream. If you can just comment on that Gavin, and thanks for taking the follow-up again.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey Gavin. Do you want to pick up on let's call it some general comments without getting lost in any of the specifics?", "Gavin Hattersley - Chief Executive Officer, MillerCoors LLC", "Right. I mean, Pablo it's little difficult for me to give you a detailed specifics as Mark says. And from an industry pricing point of view, you know price increases take place in the fall, they take place in the spring, there is no general one-size-fits all. And as I've said quite often on these calls is, we follow very clear pricing strategy and market-by-markets and brand-by-brand basis.", "And your second question is around breaking out the 80 basis points between the various sub-segments is, we just simply don't do that publicly. And from a Miller High Life point of view, we do think we've got a unique proposition here as the Champagne of Beers and we intend to continue to invest quiet strongly behind that brand, it's an important part of our sub-premium portfolio and we'll play an important role in reducing the lost market share that we've experienced in the primary portfolio. Beyond that, I can't really get into any more detail.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "All right. Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Pablo, the only thing I would add is, I mean, if you look at the choice in the U.S. market now as probably be, there's more proliferation, more choice for consumers than we've seen in living memory. So, our job is to make sure our brands deliver great value for consumers and we'll make sure we do that through a combination of our price points, SKUs that we offer, the quality of our brand communications.", "We got to be competitive. And as I say, consumers have got more variety and more choice than they've ever had before.

Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company\u2019s Safe Harbor language.", "Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today. So please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.", "The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by company\u2019s executives in discussing the company\u2019s performance, please visit the company\u2019s website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the financial reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.", "Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period in U.S. dollars.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Mark Hunter", "Thank you, Nicole. And hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. Apologies for that slight delay due to a technical issue. Many thanks for joining us today.", "With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have: Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, CEO of MillerCoors; Stewart Glendinning, CEO of Canada; Simon Cox, our European CEO; Kandy Anand, our International CEO; Lee Reichert, our Deputy General Counsel; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.", "For our earnings call today, Mauricio and I will take you through highlights of our second quarter 2016 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective on the second half of 2016.", "In the second quarter, we continued to focus on our First Choice ambition and on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio, underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our first quarter earnings call.", "Progress in the second quarter included; net sales revenue per hectoliter growth on a constant currency basis in all of our businesses, strong Coors Light growth globally, improved core brand momentum, fast-growing innovations in key markets, and strong above premium growth globally.", "We significantly increased investments behind our brands, although the timing of shipments and other short-term factors held back bottom-line performance in the quarter. In brands, Coors Light grew volume more than 4% globally, including strong double-digit growth in Europe and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in the U.S., its best performance here in nearly three years.", "In above premium, our craft portfolio drove growth from Doom Bar and other Sharp\u2019s brands in the UK; from Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada; and from Leinenkugel\u2019s Grapefruit Shandy and newly acquired Saint Archer in the U.S.", "Staropramen grew strongly across Europe outside of its home market, and in ciders, we grew volume with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. In Flavored Malt Beverages, we now have the largest hard soda franchise in the U.S. with the successful introduction of the Henry\u2019s Hard Soda brands earlier this year.", "We continued to strengthen our business through improvements to our sales execution and revenue management capabilities, increased efficiency of our operations, and implementation of common global systems.", "To ensure that our supply chain is fit for the future, in the second quarter, we reached an agreement to purchase land in British Columbia on which we\u2019ll build a new efficient and flexible brewery over the next few years. This new brewery site is attractively priced, has rail access, and is situated on the Trans-Canada Highway, making it ideal for serving the Western Canada and U.S. markets. And we anticipate completing the land purchase this month.", "In the past few months, we\u2019ve also made substantial progress on the pending MillerCoors transaction, including in integration planning and completing the necessary financing at very attractive rates. Investor demand for our recent debt offering was very strong, and we achieved record and near-record low interest rates on our debt issue. We\u2019re pleased with the transaction progress made to-date, and we continue to plan for a closing before the end of 2016. More specifically, October the 10, based on the joint ABI/SAB recent announcements.", "We\u2019re very excited to be much closer to completing this game-changing transaction, which will enable simplified decision-making and will reduce the complexities of dual ownership; it will help us to become a more integrated and efficient brewer; and it will enable us to become a more effective competitor as a single owner, promoting consumer choice in an increasingly diverse and fast-growing brewing industry.", "As part of integration planning process, last week, I announced some leadership appointments that will strengthen our combined organization and that will take effect upon the close of the transaction. Our transaction and its timing remain dependent clearly on the completion of the ABI and SABMiller transaction.", "The regional highlights for the second quarter are as follows. In the U.S. while overall sales-to-retail volume decreased 1.7%, driven primarily by our below premium brands, Coors Light STRs were up low-single digits in the quarter, which was its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2012. Domestic net revenue per hectoliter grew 0.7% for the quarter as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix.", "Our largest brand gained share of the Premium Light segment for the fifth consecutive quarter. And please note that all our performance discussions relating to Coors Light exclude the Citrus Radler extension that was discontinued last year.", "With flat STRs, Miller Lite gained share of the Premium Light segment for the seventh consecutive quarter. Improved momentum for these two brands was driven by continued rollout of their new visual identities and consumer communications, which appeal to a broad section of men and women, millennials and multicultural consumers.", "Additionally, Coors Banquet is now in its tenth consecutive year of growth. In the higher-margin above premium segment, Henry\u2019s was the number one Hard Soda franchise in the second quarter on the strength of Henry\u2019s Hard Orange and Ginger Ale. In craft, Leinenkugel\u2019s Grapefruit Shandy and the newly acquired Saint Archer brands continued to drive volume, although Blue Moon Belgian White declined low-single digits.", "As an important indication of the traction we\u2019re gaining in the U.S., for the first time in the history of the joint venture, in 2016 MillerCoors finished number one in the Tamarron Supplier Survey, which polls hundreds of U.S. distributors in rating the performance of beer, wine and spirits suppliers. This is a key accomplishment in our First Choice ambition for our customers and is an example of the types of efforts we are driving globally to ensure we are focusing on these important customer relationships.", "On the bottom line, MillerCoors\u2019 second quarter underlying net income declined 3.8% to $468.8 million, driven primarily by the timing of shipments due to calendar shifts, which were partially offset by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix.", "Meanwhile, Molson Coors\u2019 second quarter underlying equity income in the U.S. segment increased 1.4% due to an $11.1 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports. This tax refund is based on qualifying volumes exported from the U.S. by Coors Brewing Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Molson Coors, and was driven by new legislation enacted this year in the U.S. First half underlying equity earnings in the U.S. segment, which was not as significantly affected by the timing of beer shipments, increased 9.4%.", "In Canada, STRs declined 0.1%, and our sales volume declined 0.8% in the second quarter. Weak economic conditions in Western Canada were largely offset by favorable timing of the Canada Day holiday this year. Net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.2% in the quarter, despite competitive pressures in the East and a pronounced consumer shift to value brands in Alberta.", "In core brands, although Coors Light volumes declined, our new packaging, advertising and in-pack sales promotions are driving improved consumer purchase intent and brand health scores. Molson Canadian volume suffered from a significant shift towards the value segment in Alberta.", "In above premium and craft, we continued to see strong performance, as Coors Banquet, Belgian Moon, Mad Jack, Heineken, Dos Equis, Sol, and Strongbow Cider all grew volume and share in the quarter, along with our Creemore Springs craft brands\u2019.", "In headline financial results for the quarter, Canada underlying pre-tax income decreased 19.7% in constant currency, primarily due to a significant increase in sales and marketing investment, as we discussed on our last earnings call. Looking at the first half on the same basis, underlying pre-tax income decreased 10.1%, also driven primarily by increased brand investments.", "Our Europe business achieved 1.6% volume growth and increased market share across the region, driven by growth in seven of our 11 lead core and premium brands. Net sales revenue per hectoliter increased 1.3% in local currency, driven entirely by brand and geographic mix.", "In core brands, Carling, Bergenbier and Ozujsko all grew share of segment in their primary markets. In our above premium portfolio increased momentum, with strong double-digit growth by Coors Light and our craft portfolio; including Blue Moon, Doom Bar and the other Sharp\u2019s brands.", "Finally, the inclusion of Rekorderlig cider since the middle of 2015 and the full repatriation of the Staropramen brand in the UK this year added to the solid progress we made in premiumizing our Europe portfolio.", "Consistent with the first quarter, underlying pre-tax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand investments and amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit and the termination of the Heineken contract brewing arrangements in the UK, along with unfavorable foreign currency movements this quarter.", "Our International business grew Coors Light at a strong double-digit rate in the second quarter, driven by Latin America, including our brand launch in Colombia late last year. Overall volume including royalty volume declined 9.3%, driven by the enactment of alcohol prohibition in Bihar, in India; the transfer of Staropramen in the UK to our Europe segment; and the volume impact of our substantial China restructure.", "Underlying pre-tax performance improved in the second quarter. And drivers included volume growth in Latin America and Japan, favorable sales mix, as well as lower price promotion and overhead expenses related to the restructure of our China business last year, including cycling $3.6 million of price promotion expense a year-ago.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mauricio to give second quarter financial highlights and perspective on the balance of 2016. Mauricio?", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Thank you, Mark, and hello everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless I note otherwise. Our second quarter financial headlines are as follows.", "Net sales were down approximately 2% in U.S. dollars due to currency movements. On a constant-currency basis, net sales increased 1.9%, driven by Europe, Canada and International. Our net sales per hectoliter increased 2.4% in constant currency, due to positive mix.", "On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported pre-tax income of $196.9 million, 32.1% lower than a year ago, while after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors was $174.1 million, down 24.1% from the prior-year result. These decreases were primarily due to non-cash special charges and other non-core expenses related to our pending acquisition, the alcohol prohibition in Bihar, and planned brewery closures, along with higher MG&A expenses.", "Underlying pre-tax income in constant currency decreased 6.9% in the quarter and 8.6% on a reported basis, partly due to year-over-year differences in the timing of brand investments and other expenses, as well as lower worldwide volume. First half results eliminate some of these quarterly timing differences and reflected 3.4% growth in constant currency underlying pre-tax income and 2% growth on a reported basis in U.S. dollars.", "Second quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 9.2% to $239.5 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, higher brand investments in all of our businesses, and negative foreign currency movements, which were partially offset by positive mix, lower underlying net interest expense and higher underlying U.S. equity income.", "Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $428.7 million, that is 5.8% lower than a year ago, while our first half underlying EBITDA grew 1.2%. Underlying free cash flow in the first half of 2016 was $158.9 million. This represents a decrease of $82.2 million from the prior-year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income, negative foreign currency, and less benefit from working capital changes, excluding special and other non-core items, including higher cash paid for taxes.", "In early July, we completed a $7 billion long-term debt offering with a weighted-average coupon of 2.9%, including the lowest 30-year BBB-minus coupon ever issued in U.S. dollars, as well as 1.25% coupon for our eight-year euro debt issue.", "As a result of these attractive rates, we anticipate that our annualized interest cost on the transaction financing will be approximately $260 million at current interest and foreign exchange rates. This annual interest expense is nearly $200 million lower than the assumed bridge-loan and other transaction-related interest expense included in the 2015 pro forma financial results that we filed in May.", "With the debt offering, we achieved broad, high-quality investor participation and attractive pricing. More than 400 institutional investors participated in the offering.", "Combining this debt issue with our $2.6 billion equity offering in February and up to $3 billion of a previously arranged term loan, we now have in place all the financing needed for the pending MillerCoors transaction.", "Total debt at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, which does not include the $7 billion of long-term debt we issued in July. Cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $3 billion, resulting in net debt of $37 million, which is significantly lower than prior-year due to the cash proceeds received from our equity offering earlier in the year. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the quarter.", "Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some factors to consider for the last two quarters of this year: Incremental Europe brand amortization expense, with an annualized impact of approximately $15 million, which began in the fourth quarter of 2015, along with lower net pension benefit in Europe this year.", "A total prohibition on the sale of alcohol, unexpectedly implemented by the state government in Bihar, in early April. We don\u2019t know how long this ban will be in place, and we expect this development to present a headwind for our International business for the foreseeable future or until it is overturned.", "And, finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rates would be headwind of about $13 million to our underlying pre-tax results in the second half this year, with most of the impact in Europe. Given the recent volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.", "Regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction, the timing of which will have a big impact on virtually all of our guidance measures.", "For the full-year, we continue to expect, cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016, and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense.", "MG&A expense in Corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis, which excludes expenses related to our pending transaction. Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis, which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income. An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, or adjustments to our uncertain tax positions.", "In updated guidance, we now expect underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million, which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia. As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe in local currency to increase at a low-single-digit rate for the full-year 2016.", "We now expect 2016 MillerCoors COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a low-single-digit rate versus prior-year. Further cost reductions, including acceleration of some of our cost savings initiatives, and changes in sales mix drove the change from previous guidance of approximately in line. We now expect our International COGS per hectoliter to increase at a double-digit rate for 2016. This is up from a high-single digit increase previously, due to geographic mix changes.", "We continue to expect annual cost savings for this year and next year to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. This view excludes cost savings from MillerCoors, as well as synergies resulting from the pending MillerCoors acquisition, which we expect to be $200 million by year four following the transaction close.", "Finally, here are the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses early in the third quarter. In the U.S., for the three weeks through July 23, STRs decreased at a mid-single digit rate, partially due to the timing of the load-in for the July 4 holiday, while they decreased at a high-single digit rate in Canada for the same period.", "In Europe, volume through July 25 decreased high-single digits. And our International sales volume, including royalty volume, through July 23 decreased at a low-single-digit rate, primarily due to the alcohol prohibition in Bihar.", "As ever, please keep in mind that these numbers represent only a portion of the current quarter, and trends could change in the weeks ahead. Also, as a reminder, following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we plan to discontinue providing these early-next-quarter volume trends.", "At this point, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap up and the Q&A. Mark?", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Mauricio. In the second half of this year, we will continue to drive our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda in the geographies and segments where we choose to play, ensuring we build a broader, stronger and more premium portfolio, while driving best-in-class customer service and partnerships.", "In the U.S., MillerCoors remains laser-focused on its strategy to drive total volume growth by 2019. For the first time in many years, our largest business is in line with its volume expectations through the first six months. The quarter also provided additional steps toward its growth ambition, with strengthened marketing behind flagship brands Coors Light and Miller Lite, and we\u2019re starting to see the positive impact.", "Also, we continue to see success in the innovation space. In above premium, we remain bullish on the potential of Henry\u2019s, as the hard soda category continues to grow. In the second quarter, Henry\u2019s became the number-one hard soda franchise, and MillerCoors plans to roll out Henry\u2019s Hard Cherry Cola this month.", "In the craft segment, MillerCoors will continue to invest behind ad support for Blue Moon and Leinenkugel\u2019s during the balance of the peak beer selling season. MillerCoors also recently announced that it has agreed to purchase a majority interest in Oregon-based Hop Valley Brewing Company and to increase its ownership of the Georgia-based Terrapin Beer Company from a minority stake to a majority interest. These are highly regarded brewers both in their regions and nationwide, and they further strengthen our leading U.S. craft portfolio, which also includes Blue Moon, Leinenkugel\u2019s, and Saint Archer.", "Additionally, next month at its fall meeting with distributors, the U.S. team will share plans to improve the performance of its below premium portfolio. And the team continues to expand its Building with Beer retail strategy beyond the on-premise to additional channels to build First Choice customer partnerships.", "With changes pending in the MillerCoors ownership structure, the mood is not one of apprehension, but of excitement. In the meantime, everyone at MillerCoors remains disciplined, decisive and accountable for growing our business, transforming our portfolio, and driving shareholder value.", "In Canada, we are investing behind new product-quality-focused advertising and improved sales execution via our Field Sales Management program. These efforts are aimed not only at improving our premium performance, but also continuing to accelerate our growing above premium portfolio.", "We will continue our push in the hard soda space with Mad Jack Root Beer and Ginger Ale, the first major hard soda entries in Canada. Additionally, we signed a partnership agreement in May with Brasseur de Montreal to leverage its craft and specialty beers in Quebec and across our strong Canada distribution network. Following the close of the pending MillerCoors transaction, we\u2019re also looking forward to bringing the Miller brands back into our Canada portfolio.", "In Europe, we achieved top-line and market-share growth in the second quarter on the strength of our core and above premium brands, along with the addition of the Rekorderlig cider and Staropramen brands in the UK.", "Increased brand amortization expense will continue to present a headwind for one more quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our core brand portfolio across Europe to continue to grow share of segment. This will include leveraging our English Premier League sponsorship well beyond Carling in the UK to many high-potential brand and market opportunities.", "We will also continue to premiumize our portfolio, with Coors Light, the Sharp\u2019s portfolio led by Doom Bar, Cobra, Rekorderlig and Staropramen in the UK, as well as Ireland\u2019s leading craft brand, Franciscan Well.", "Our International business is focused on continuing to accelerate our overall growth in existing and select new markets, while attaining profitability in 2016 on a constant-currency basis versus our original 2013 commitment, now excluding the impact of the Bihar alcohol prohibition.", "Upon closing of the MillerCoors transaction, we will integrate the Miller international brands into our portfolio and leverage a footprint that complements our growth strategy and allows us to gain entrance into high-priority markets, while increasing our business scale in current markets.", "We\u2019ll also continue to drive rapid growth for Coors Light in Latin America. Going forward, the Coors, Miller and Staropramen brands will be the priorities for our International brand portfolio. And in India, we\u2019ll continue to add scale through our Mount Shivalik business.", "To wrap up, in the second half of 2016, we will continue to focus on our First Choice for consumer and customer ambition, all driven through our Profit After Capital Charge lens and with the intent to drive total shareholder returns.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, 1 P.M. Eastern Time today, Dave Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via web cast on our website.", "Additionally, we hope to see many of you at the Barclays Consumer Staples Conference in Boston on September 7.", "So, at that point, Nicole, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions, please. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Judy Hong", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Mark Hunter", "Hey, Judy.", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Hi, Judy.", "Judy Hong", "So first, it seems like your volume trends have worsened in July for all of your regions. I\u2019m understanding that this is really your short-term trend, but can you provide any color just in terms of how much is this maybe worsening macro versus timing versus any other drivers of that softness?", "Mark Hunter", "Hey, Judy. It\u2019s Mark. Let me take that. I mean, as we\u2019ve intimated, we\u2019re going to discontinue post the acquisition of these short-term trends because my idea is that they are not helpful and there\u2019s so much volatility around trading days, the timing of holidays, some of the promotional activity in the market. So, it\u2019s very, very difficult to take a read on it. So, it\u2019s very early in the quarter. I think if you look at our longer term volume trends, that\u2019s a much better indication as to the health of our business, and I really won\u2019t read too much in for the short-term numbers.", "Judy Hong", "Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then the second quarter, obviously we\u2019ve seen your brand investments step up, and you certainly called out that this would happen in the quarter. But, just wanted to get a sense of some of the payback that you\u2019re seeing as you step up these investments and the likelihood that you continue to see these investments going forward.", "And then if I drill down into Canada, it seems like certainly the STR got better in the second quarter, but margins did get negatively impacted. So, sort of the trade-off that you\u2019re seeing in that particular region in terms of share versus profitability.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Well, couple of questions in there, Judy. So, I\u2019ll pass over to Stewart shortly to pick up on the Canada-specific question. I think your broader point on investment is a good question. I mean, we are driving a First Choice for consumer and customer agenda. Central to that is the quality, the breadth and depth of our brand portfolio and our ability to premiumize our portfolio, while building a customer relationship.", "So, we made good on the commitment to step up our investment through the second quarter. I think if you look at our NSR per hectoliter, we saw NSR per hec growth in all of our regions. I\u2019m encouraged by the sequential improvement in our share trends in all of our regions as well from Q1 into Q2. But clearly, brand building is a long-term game, and my objective and the executive\u2019s objective here is to continue to invest in a sustained way. Clearly, the focus is always on the quality of our investments.", "You\u2019ve heard me say in the past, I\u2019d rather spend less dollars in a great idea than more dollars in a bad idea, but our job is to develop great ideas and then invest in a sustained way, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, and I expect to see us continue to do that through the third quarter as well. As I say, the sequential improvement that you\u2019ve seen from Q1 to Q2, I think, is a testament to the focus and outlook right across our business.", "Stewart, do you want to pick up on the Canada-specific question? Do we have Stewart? Stewart, are you on mute or have we lost you? If we\u2019ve lost you, you won\u2019t be able to answer that question. It sounds like we\u2019ve lost Stewart for a second.", "So, Judy, we\u2019ll get him back in, and then I\u2019ll fill him back on to answer your specific question. If you can just bear with us. Apologies for that. We seem to have a couple of technical hitches this morning.", "Judy Hong", "Got it. Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Judy. Hey, Stewart?", "Stewart Glendinning", "Mark.", "Mark Hunter", "You\u2019re back on.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Am I back on now? Okay. Well, hold on.", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Kind of redial me in. So, cancel that thought. Okay. So just \u2013 if I can just answer that question. Sorry, I was talking and nobody could hear me. But obviously, two pieces to margin, Judy. The NSR which we were quite pleased with, I mean, was broadly in line with underlying trend in Q1, really was driven by the COGS. And if you looked at what happened in cost of goods sold in the second half, we broadly offset our inflation with cost savings, and the increase you see there was the increase in some of our marketing investments for impact promotions which go in case.", "So that was investment behind the brands. You saw some impact from transactional effects and volume deleverage. But, I would look at the first half and say, if you looked at the first half, actually, we had an improvement in COGS of about 0.7%. So, hopefully that helps.", "Judy Hong", "Got it. Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Thank you, Stewart.", "Judy Hong", "Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Stewart. Thanks, Judy. Nicole, back to you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen. Your line is open.", "Vivien Azer", "Hi. Good morning.", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Vivien.", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Hi, Vivien.", "Vivien Azer", "I was hoping to touch on the European segment please. While the positive net revenue per hectoliter is certainly encouraging, given what we\u2019ve seen over the course of 2015 per your comments, rate itself was negative. So, could you just offer a little bit more color on the pricing environment in Europe and whether there is any reason for optimism that the pricing outside of positive product or geographic mix could start to materialize? Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Thanks, Vivien. I\u2019m going to be hopeful here and suggest that Simon might be on the call. Simon, are you with us?", "Simon Cox", "I\u2019m speaking now. Hope you can hear me?", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah, we can. Thanks, Simon.", "Simon Cox", "Okay. Great. Yeah, okay. So, yes. I got the question. Thank you, Vivien. I mean, overall, we would characterize the European quarter as pretty solid and that sales revenue were up at 3%. What we\u2019re trying to do obviously is make sure that we\u2019ve got an appropriate balance between price and volume, or net NSR per hectoliter and volume, which, again, I think we achieved in the quarter. Volumes were up 1.6% and NSR per hectoliter at 1.3%. So, I think that\u2019s a reasonably good balance.", "It is true that the NSR hectoliter is driven by mix with price under pressure. But that goes back to our premiumization strategy. We\u2019ve been trying to make sure that we invest behind the premium brands to drive the right \u2013 both portfolio and geographic mix.", "So, whilst pricing is under pressure across many of the markets, I think we\u2019re doing a pretty solid job in recognizing that and driving volumes and shares and mix to get to an overall positive revenue growth. So, we\u2019ll be quite satisfied with it, recognizing that pricing remains competitive.", "Vivien Azer", "Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And just if I could follow-up on that.", "Mark Hunter", "Yes.", "Vivien Azer", "Thank you. In terms of the share gains that you\u2019re generating, those are in volume terms. But, do you have a sense of how your dollar share is trending? I\u2019m just curious whether this pricing pressure is true across the categories, or whether your pricing is under a little bit more pressure on an apples-to-apples basis.", "Simon Cox", "We don\u2019t believe that our pricing is under excessive pressure. Obviously, we\u2019ve got 11 markets that we have to cover, so it\u2019s very, very difficult to give you a sort of generic answer. But, we believe that our pricing and our volume is sort of in sensible collaboration. We took about 0.3% share across the region, and I don\u2019t think we sacrificed price in an uncontrolled way to do that.", "So, I keep coming back to you, Vivien. It\u2019s important for us that we manage premiumization and mix, overall volume and share and overall pricing. And I think as long as we\u2019re getting overall net sales revenue growth like we have to \u2013 like we did do in the quarter end of 3%, we would be happy with that and think that\u2019s pretty solid.", "Vivien Azer", "Absolutely. Thank you very much.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Vivien. Nicole?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Yes. Thanks and good morning, everyone. One on Canada, Mark or Stewart, and another one on the global potential of some brands besides Coors Light. But on Canada, I think the takeaway here is that the spend increase is working. The share trends are improving. When you lift the hood, what gives you confidence, if you have it, that the upgrade in trend is sticky, so to speak. What are you seeing with brands and channels that makes you think that there won\u2019t be an issue three months from now?", "Of course, the category is competitive, but trying to get a little better understanding of how much confidence we can have it will hold. And to the extent you can factor in July, appreciating that it\u2019s just one month of data, that would be helpful too. So, that\u2019s my question on Canada.", "Mark Hunter", "Mark, do you want to come back for the global question? And so, I\u2019ve asked Stewart to take that \u2013 to respond to that. Then if you come back on the global brand piece. So, Stewart, do you want...", "Mark Swartzberg", "Oh, sure. Sure enough.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Yes. Sure, Mark. Yeah. Look. You probably did, just talking about our First Choice agenda just briefly and just saying that against the three platforms, we\u2019ve been driving \u2013 lowering our cost base, overhauling our supply chain network and improving the frontend. All three of those actually are looking good. On the first two, we continue to see cost savings in the quarter, and that allowed us to drive some of that brand investment that we put behind commercial.", "And the money that we put behind commercial really went to three places. It went to invest behind our growing above premium portfolio, which has continued to grow share of beer. So, I think actually that\u2019s very sticky. Those brands have continued to grow and Coors Banquet turned in a better than 20% growth again this quarter.", "I think the second piece is we put money behind our big brands relative to in-case promotions. And I think last year, we had some concerns that we weren\u2019t competitive. I think this year, we were well-balanced, and I think that was a positive.", "And then on the third investment, we pushed investment behind our share of voice. We were under indexing. And together with really effective advertising copy, we\u2019ve seen that now continue to grow our brand scores. So, growing brand scores is a great tell-tale sign that you\u2019re spending money in the right place. So, that\u2019s how I\u2019d describe the brand expense for Q2.", "Mark Swartzberg", "That\u2019s great. Well, congratulations. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Stewart Glendinning", "Cheers.", "Mark Hunter", "Mark, do you want to pick up your global question?", "Mark Swartzberg", "Oh, okay. I thought you were saying \u2013 that would be great. Yes. Thank you for that. Coors Light, I mean, plus 4% is a great number, and I think there\u2019s reasons to believe you can accelerate from there. So that in itself is something to draw attention to. But, you mentioned Staropramen. You mentioned Miller.", "Could you give us a sense of where you think you are in the evolution specifically of Staropramen, how much potential you see here for the brand, in the U.S.? But more broadly, we see how it\u2019s helping you in Europe. Just trying to get a sense of how much it can start to deliver on the kind of performance we\u2019re seeing from Coors Light.", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah. So, if you look at the shape of our existing International portfolio, the two backbone brands are principally Coors Light and Staropramen. And clearly, Blue Moon is now in many, many markets globally, growing rapidly from a small base.", "If you look at Staropramen specifically, post the StarBev acquisition, we increased investment in the brand really across Greater Europe, so outside of the Czech market, and we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in many of those markets. My personal perspective is on a Greater Europe basis, there\u2019s still a lot of runway ahead of us.", "And one of the changes I announced just in the last couple of weeks, Mark, is that we\u2019ll now look at our European business, including our export and license markets, and one of the benefits from that is we have a more holistic Europe approach across all markets on Staropramen.", "I think outside of Europe, that\u2019s part of our thinking and our emerging planning ahead of integration. As Staropramen is currently in Canada, we\u2019re just going to \u2013 testing and incubating the brand there. The U.S. market was slightly more complex because of the distributor relationship or the importer relationship that we inherited when we acquired the StarBev business.", "We\u2019re working our way through that and there\u2019s a broader conversation with Gavin and the team really looking at where we want to place our bets on our own portfolio going forward, recognizing that we\u2019re kind of \u2013 we have an embarrassment of Regis with Pilsner Urquell and Peroni and [indiscernible] Staropramen potentially in the future. So, that\u2019s work that we\u2019re currently thinking our way through just now.", "But in terms of the heartland for Staropramen which is, let\u2019s call it, Greater Europe, very, very solid progress and Ukraine which is a really difficult market, we continue to take share there. So, I feel very good about the possibilities ahead for Staropramen as part of our kind of three-pronged International portfolio including addition of the Miller brand.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Fair enough. All right. Thank you, Mark.", "Mark Hunter", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob Ottenstein from Evercore. Your line is open.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Great. Thank you very much. A couple of questions, first, pretty significant lowering in your CapEx guidance, I wonder if you could give us some color around that please?", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Is that one of two questions, Robert?", "Rob Ottenstein", "Yes. I was going to hold back on the second.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. So, Mauricio?", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Yes. Hi, Robert. How are you? So, the guidance we had previously given was CapEx of $300 million. We revised that down now to $220 million. The original guidance included the new plant in Vancouver and under the new guidance, we\u2019ve excluded that plant. So, the delta there will be $80 million, includes that plant plus some savings that we have on our annual CapEx plan.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Okay. And then what was the reason for excluding it now?", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Just to give you greater transparency in terms of what the CapEx would be excluding that, because it\u2019s obviously a very large CapEx project and we didn\u2019t want that number to be just offering all of the number, plus the proceeds of Vancouver are not in the free cash flow number.", "Mark Hunter", "Hey, Robert.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Okay. So, it\u2019s still going on. This is just basically a change in how you\u2019re describing what you\u2019re doing. There\u2019s no change in terms of the Vancouver plant.", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Absolutely. Exactly. That\u2019s correct.", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah, Robert, essentially, the new plant in Southern B.C. is largely but not completely probably is going to be funded by the proceeds from the sale of real estate from our Vancouver brewery. So, because the proceeds are excluded from free cash flow and CapEx and those types of numbers, we thought it would be fair to have sort of a comparable view on a CapEx guidance as well.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Got it. Got it. And then just a \u2013 I want to dig just a little bit more on the International brand potential. What if anything have you been able to accomplish in the last few months in terms of thinking through how you\u2019re going to go to market both in terms of route-to-market as well as manufacturing brewing infrastructure for the Miller global brands, and how quickly do you think you\u2019ll be able to move on that after the transaction closes?", "Mark Hunter", "Hey, Robert. It\u2019s Mark here. So, let me give you a couple of headlines and I think Kandy can fill in just a few of the details. I mean, just to reiterate, obviously, this is a significant step change opportunity for our International business. And I think as I\u2019ve indicated in the past, if you think about the Miller brands internationally, there\u2019s really kind of three volume platforms and value platforms. One is across our existing infrastructure. So, as I Indicated, we\u2019re looking forward to getting the Miller brands back into our portfolio in Canada, and obviously, the volumes in the UK and Ireland will roll into our existing business there.", "The second platform is those markets where we already have route-to-markets and strong positions, and that will build those positions out further. So, for example, in Panama, our business, which is a strong Coors business, post that change in scale terms with the addition of the Miller brands, that\u2019ll open up a number of new markets where we currently don\u2019t have a route-to-market. And, Kandy, do you want to just talk about the progress that\u2019s been made, particularly on the second and third areas?", "Kandy Anand", "Thanks, Mark. Hi, Robert. So, it is very exciting for the International business and the Miller portfolio to an already fast-growing Coors Light portfolio which is growing strong double-digits.", "In terms of the actual progress, if you take out our top 20 markets or the Miller brand that we are inheriting, including Canada, UK, Ireland, that basically covers 95%-plus of that total volume. On these large markets, we have either have agreements or we\u2019re in the process of getting agreements, to ensure), that we have a route-to-market on day one.", "In terms of supply agreements, the combination of transition service agreements that we have previously negotiated with ABI post-transition or exporting from our U.S. business. So, those are our supply agreements. We made good progress. I mean, there is still a lot of work, a lot of countries, a lot of new markets. But, I would say at this point of time, we are on track for our day one integration.", "Rob Ottenstein", "That\u2019s...", "Kandy Anand", "Sorry, just to add...", "Rob Ottenstein", "Yeah.", "Kandy Anand", "...some of the transition agreements would be with \u2013 potentially with Asahi since they are taking over some of the European supply locations.", "Rob Ottenstein", "That\u2019s terrific. Do you have any sense of how the brands are doing this year? So the brands flat this year, up, down, any sense of order of magnitude?", "Kandy Anand", "Robert, it\u2019s a mixed bag, markets where brands doing quite well and has momentum, and there are others where it\u2019s down. So, I think as we look at the totality, they are more or less where we expected them to be based on the idea that we have which is, of course, quarter or later stage.", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah. Robert, it\u2019s Mark here. The thing I\u2019d ask you to bear in mind is clearly this is going to be a complex transition. I think we are well-planned and ready for execution. There\u2019s still some details to be sorted out. But I would actually think of it as very much in the medium-term to long-term basis.", "As you think about the growth trajectory of our business, Coors, Miller and Staropramen combined along with our emerging International craft portfolio, if you look at over the course of the next few years, I think it places us in a very, very positive place to really build out our International footprint and our International trajectory. So, the first year will be challenging and tricky in some places, but got to look beyond that to \u2013 the value that\u2019s going to be created by the addition of the Miller International portfolio.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Terrific. And just one last question. Coors Light, you gave us, I think, a 4% global number. Can you tell us what it did in Canada specifically and then what it did outside of North America, please?", "Mark Hunter", "Off the top of my head, in Canada, we were down kind of low- to mid-single digits. And then internationally, if you look at our MCI business, we were up double-digit growth. And in the UK and Ireland, we were up double-digits, in fact, kind of high-20%s, low-30% growth. So, Canada, down low- to mid-single; everywhere else outside of Canada, double-digit growth.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Okay. And any visibility in terms of stabilization in Canada?", "Mark Hunter", "Well, I think Stewart picked up on that. The focus has been on driving the right input which had an impact on the output. And I\u2019m certainly very encouraged and I know the teammate are by the fact that we\u2019ve seen our brand health metrics and our purchase intent numbers move in a very positive direction through the second quarter.", "So, any quality of our copy, the promotional intensity in terms of our in-case, the roll out of the visual identity, further alignment with the U.S. creative platform, all of those things are very well. But this is a big, big brand and you don\u2019t turn things on or turn things off overnight. So, we are working this hard, and I think we\u2019re working on the right input measures, starting certainly through our brand tracking to demonstrate that we\u2019re pulling on the right levers, and I expect to see performance improve through the balance of this year and into 2017.", "Encouragingly, when you look at Coors\u2019 trademark in totality, in Canada, and adding Banquet, which Stewart mentioned, is up over 20% again in the month. With the Coors trademarks in generally good health, Coors Light, if we can get that moving in the right direction will be in a very strong position.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Robert.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.", "Brett Cooper", "Good morning. Just a quick question. There\u2019s a push for now in the law called beer. Just wondering kind of what your thoughts are on the opportunity there? Kind of where you sit today as you go through some of your major markets?", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Brett, I think that question was around no and low alcohol beers?", "Brett Cooper", "Yeah. So that\u2019s something which has already been a relatively large part of our thinking within Molson Coors and one of the benefits when we acquired the StarBev business was actually the addition of the beer mix portfolio to our portfolio.", "So commonly described as radlers, these are beers run about 2% alcohol. So, we\u2019ve got, I think, some good learning in our business about the consumer drivers line low and no alcohol and is a central innovation point within our business, so more to follow. I think many people in alcohol are now looking at low and no alcohol choices. It\u2019s very much one of our agenda. And there will be news on that front in due course.", "Brett Cooper", "Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Brett. [Operator Instructions]", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Bryan Spillane", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Bryan.", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Hello, Bryan.", "Bryan Spillane", "I\u2019ve got two questions. One related to interest rates and the other related to reporting. So, I guess the first one just on interest rates, with interest rates, I guess post Brexit, the outlook, it looks like it\u2019s even lower. It\u2019s going to stay low for a long time. So Mauricio, could you just sort of talk to us about any effect that might potentially have on things like pension funding, assumptions that you\u2019re using for pension funding.", "And then also how it might affect the way you apply the PACC model, just simply because the cost of financing or cost of capital come done, does it sort of change it all the way you\u2019re planning, you apply the PACC model in looking at certain projects?", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Yes. Thank you, Bryan. Look, I mean, in terms of our financing, first of all, obviously, as you heard me say before, we had a fantastic result in our long-term debt offering. The interest cost that we were able to get on the financing was about $200 million lower than what we had assumed in the pro forma financials that we had submitted a couple of months ago. So, that clearly will have a very beneficial impact going forward.", "And as for the PACC model, of course, we\u2019re constantly updating the cost of capital that we would use to analyze and review the various alternatives, i.e. should we delever, should we invest behind our brands, or should we pursue certain M&A opportunities, or should we return money to shareholders. And obviously those rates will be adjusted and are adjusted accordingly, given what\u2019s happening in the market and our outlook going forward.", "Bryan Spillane", "And then just on pensions, I guess as you\u2019re contemplating the merger of MillerCoors and Molson Coors and just looking at your pension assumptions, is there anything that we should be watching out for there, again, related to the interest rate outlook being lower for longer, probably?", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Well, as you know, I mean, that tends to have a double effect on the one hand because of the returns that you have on the pension assets and also the discount rate that you use for the obligations.", "But at present, I mean, those things have been taken into account in terms of the guidance that we\u2019ve given; and again, where our defined benefit pension plans, we think that the cash contributions will be in the order of between $45 million to $65 million this year and the expense of around $17 million, and that includes the 42% of our MillerCoors contribution and expense. Obviously, that will be updated going forward for 100%", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. And then just one last one on financial reporting. I think at the Investor Day, you kind of walked through how you\u2019ll give us a little bit better visibility in terms of the transaction-related reporting. I think this spring the SEC had, I guess, made some rulings or statements about just sort of, I guess, more scrutiny on non-GAAP disclosures and maybe auditing it or scrutinizing it a little bit more. So, can you just \u2013 is there anything that we should think about in terms of your plans for the transaction-related reporting relative to kind of what the SEC has been commenting on?", "Mark Hunter", "Well, look, I mean on the one hand, what you\u2019re saying is absolutely right. The SEC has revised their position in terms of GAAP versus non-GAAP disclosures, and we obviously are following in line with that as are many other companies, many other public companies in the U.S. And what that means is that in the 10-Ks and the 10-Qs, you will not now see some of the underlying measures that we used to put in there before.", "As for the information that you would receive post transaction, obviously, that\u2019s information that you are going to receive through our calls, and we\u2019ll still refer to those metrics because we think that they can give the investors and the analysts a very good indication of how our business is performing.", "And just to recap what we had mentioned to you at the New York Analysts Conference is that post the transaction close, we will be referring to a new number of updated synergies and cost savings. We are also going to talk about the transaction pro forma adjusted EPS. And we\u2019re also going to talk about the cash flow-generating ability of the new business going forward.", "Bryan Spillane", "Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Sure, Bryan.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Well, if there are no questions, I\u2019d just like to thank everybody for your interest in Molson Coors Brewing Company. We are poised, as we look forward, to the hopeful conclusion of the ABI and SAB transaction and our acquisition of the 58% in MillerCoors, which will be transformational for our business.", "So, I\u2019m sure everybody will be tuned in over the coming months as that comes to culmination. Thank you for your interest, and we look forward to see many of you shortly in Boston at the conference at the beginning of September. Thanks for your interest today, everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Before we begin, I would like to paraphrase the Company's Safe Harbor language.", "Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today. So please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections. The Company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period in U.S. dollars.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Mark Hunter", "Thank you, Chad. And hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. Many thanks for joining us today.", "With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have; Mauricio Restrepo, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, our CEO of our U.S. business, Fred Landtmeters, the CEO of our Canada business; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; and Stewart Glendinning, the CEO of our International business, along with Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal Officer, and Dave Dunnewald, our VP of Investor Relations.", "Today, Mauricio I will split our call into two parts; first, we will take you through our third quarter 2016 results to an essence closeout Molson and Coors Brewing Company, as it's been structured for the past several years. Then, we'll turn our attention to our recently completed MillerCoors transaction, and three newer updated financial reporting metrics along with some perspective for the fourth quarter of this year. In third quarter we continue to focus on our First Choice ambition on building a stronger, broader and more premium brand portfolio underpinned by incremental sales and marketing investment as we've discussed all year.", "Business highlights for the quarter and year-to-date included increased net sales revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis in all our businesses for the quarter and year-to-date. We increased investments in our brands globally. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained share in U.S. Premium Light segment for the quarter, including the highest segment share gain in three years for Coors Light. We saw 1.2% global volume growth for Coors Light on a year-to-date basis, with growth of more than 14% outside of North America. We had fast growing innovations in key markets including Henry's Hard Soda in the U.S. and Mad Jack in Canada. And we saw global growth year-to-date in our above premium portfolio, for example, Doom Bar and other Sharps brands in the UK, Creemore Springs and Belgian Moon in Canada and our four newly acquired brewers in the U.S.", "We also so strong growth by Staropramen across Europe outside of its whole markets and we also additionally saw cider volume increases with Rekorderlig in Europe and Strongbow in Canada. Overall, we continue to strengthen our business through improvements through our sales execution and revenue management capabilities increased efficiency of our operations and implementation of common global systems.", "Regional highlights for the third quarter and year-to-date are as follows; in the U.S. overall sales to retail volume decreased 4% for the quarter, and 2.5% year-to-date on a trading day adjusted basis driven primarily by our below premium and premium light brands. Coors Light and Miller Lite again gained segment market share, the SDR's declined reflecting industry trends. Coors Banquet continue to grow SDR volume and segment share. And in a higher market above premium segment, Henry's continues to be the number one Hard Soda franchise. Also our Saint Archer, Sheraton [ph] Hop Valley and revolver businesses of significantly expanded our craft offering for consumers and customers.", "Domestic net sales revenue per hectoliter grew 1.6% for the quarter, and 1.2% year-to-date as a result of favorable net pricing and positive sales mix. On the bottom line, U.S. segment underlying equity income increased 9% in the third quarter driven primarily by lower cost of goods sold, higher net pricing and positive sales mix. Year-to-date underlying equity income increased 9.3%, primarily due to the factors mentioned above, as well as a $12.3 million anticipated refund of federal excise tax paid on imports which we discussed on our last earnings call.", "In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 0.6% driven by growth in our above premium brands. This NSR increase reflected hairline price increases and positive brand mix but with higher levels of spend back as we ensured our brands were competitive on a market-by-market basis. Our performance in the above premium segment continue to be strong as we saw growth in both their own brands and their partner brands. Coors Banquet, Mad Jack, and Belgian Moon; all continued to deliver strong growth and our craft brands continue to grow share in the total beer category.", "The mainstream segment continue to face market pressure where our brand held scores for Coors Light and Molson Canadian have continued to improve month-over-month; and our sales execution input measures are similarly improving. Our COGS per hectoliter increased 3.5% in local currency with most of the increase being driven by volume deleverage and mix shift to higher cost products. Our cost savings program continue to be strong and fully offset impacts of inflation and other cost increases in the quarter. In the bottom-line underlying pre-tax income claimed by $15.9 million in the third quarter driven by lower volume, increased COGS, higher marketing investments and foreign exchange impacts of U.S. dollar-based supplier contracts.", "Europe net sales decreased 0.6% in local currency for the third quarter driven by 1.4% lower volume due to weaker demand versus strong sales last year across much of the region. Along with some trade inventory overhand from the Euro 2016 Football or Soccer Championships in the second quarter of this year. Nonetheless, we held our share position in the region and our continued portfolio premiumization and mix management drove a 1.2% increase in net sales revenue per hectoliter in local currency. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth by Coors Light, Staropramen outside of the Czech Republic, and their craft portfolio including Blue Moon, Doom Bar, and other the Sharps brands, as well as Rekorderlig cider.", "Underlying pre-tax income was lower in the quarter due to higher brand amortization expenses, lower net pension benefit, and unfavorable foreign-currency movements, especially related to the depreciation of the British pound. Year-to-date the benefit of higher net sales and NSR per hectoliter in local currency, volume and market share in Europe were more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements, higher brand amortization expense, lower pension benefits and the termination of the Heineken contract arrangement in the UK.", "Our international business continues to drive Coors Light momentum with year-to-date volume of this brand, up mid-single digits led by growth in Latin America and Australia. Excluding impacts of total alcohol prohibition in Bihar, India and the transfer of the Staropramen UK business to our Europe segment, our year-to-date underlying pre-tax underlying performance has significantly improved versus last year driven by volume growth in the remaining international markets.", "Now I will turn it over to Mauricio to give third quarter financial highlights and new performance metrics. Mauricio? ", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. As a reminder, all of the results that I will be discussing are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. So our third quarter and year-to-date financial headlines are as follows; net sales were down approximately 7% in U.S. dollars in the third quarter and about 5% year-to-date, primarily due to currency movements, especially in Europe, as well as lower worldwide volume.", "On a constant currency basis, net sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter and were virtually unchanged year-to-date versus the same period last year. Our net sales per hectoliter in constant currency increased 1.3% in the quarter and 0.9% year-to-date due to positive mix. On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported third quarter after-tax income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $202.5 million, up from $13.7 million a year ago. This increase was primarily driven by cycling $275 million of impairment charges recorded for certain Europe brands last year.", "On a year-to-date basis, U.S. GAAP after-tax income increased 67.5% to $539.8 million, driven by brand impairment charges last year, and a gain on the sale of our Vancouver Brewery earlier this year. Third quarter underlying after-tax income decreased 14.3% to $222.7 million or $1.03 per diluted share, driven by lower worldwide volume, a higher underlying tax rate, and higher brand investments globally, which were partially offset by positive mix and higher underlying U.S. equity income.", "Year-to-date underlying after-tax income decreased 5.5% to $576.4 million, driven by the same factors as in the quarter along with the negative foreign currency movements. Underlying pre-tax income declined 6.2% for the third quarter and 1.3% year-to-date. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $403.1 million, 4.1% lower than a year ago and our year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 0.8%. Underlying free cash flow in the first three quarters of 2016 was $469.4 million. This represents a decrease of $24.9 million from the prior year, primarily driven by lower underlying after-tax income and lower distributions from MillerCoors.", "Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.9 billion, cash and cash equivalents totaled slightly less than $10 billion resulting in a net cash position of $94 million as we prepare to close the MillerCoors transaction on October 11. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial result in the quarter. Also, please see the Investor Relations page of our website this morning for updated 2015 full-year and 2016 year-to-date pro forma financial statements that reflect our preliminary purchase accounting for the transaction.", "Now looking forward to the remainder of 2016, following are some financial factors to consider for the fourth quarter. Our Europe business results will continue to reflect lower net pension benefit. Total alcohol prohibition in Bihar has presented a headwind in an international business since its enactment in April this year and we will continue to address this within our business. And finally, foreign currency translation, which at current exchange rate would be a headwind of approximately $8 million to our underlying pre-tax results in the fourth quarter this year, with all of the impact in Europe. Given the volatility of our key foreign currencies, particularly the British pound, it is important to watch these rates closely.", "Now regarding 2016 guidance, all of the following metrics exclude any effects of the MillerCoors and Miller global brands transaction. For the full year, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $45 million to $65 million in 2016 and pension expense of approximately $17 million, including our 42% of MillerCoors contributions and expense. Underlying capital spending of approximately $220 million which excludes capital this year related to the construction of our new brewery in British Columbia, which we expect to be largely funded by the proceeds from the sale of our Vancouver Brewery earlier this year.", "MG&A expense in corporate of approximately $120 million on an underlying basis which excludes expenses related to the MillerCoors transaction. Consolidated net interest expense of approximately $110 million on an underlying basis which excludes transaction-related interest expense and income. An underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excise tax deductions or share-based compensation or adjustments to our uncertain tax position.", "As far as our cost outlook is concerned, we continue to expect full year 2016 cost of goods sold per hectoliter in Canada and Europe to increase at a low single-digit rate in local currency, and we expect a low single-digit decrease in MillerCoors and a double-digit increase in international versus prior year. As we first mentioned several months ago, with the completion of the MillerCoors transaction we are no longer providing the most recent volume trends for each of our businesses.", "Earlier this year we told you that we would share more specifics regarding three new performance metrics with you once the transaction closed. These metrics are transaction adjusted EPS, and all in multi-year cost savings target, and an early view of our combined company underlying free cash flow target for 2017. So taking these in order; transaction adjusted EPS is a new, non-GAAP performance measure we are introducing to provide enhanced visibility to the performance and value of our Company post-transaction. To calculate this measure we start with underlying book EPS, a non-GAAP measure, and then add back after-tax book amortization that is directly related to the transaction, and we then add the transaction-related cash tax benefits.", "Based on our latest pro forma financial statements which we will post on our website this morning, our 2015 pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $6.11 per diluted share on an underlying basis. This calculation includes transaction-related after-tax book amortization of approximately $42 million and cash tax benefits of $275 million per year, but it does not include any pre-tax income related to the Miller global brands nor any benefit from deal synergies. Because the routes to market and supply chain structures for many of the Miller global brands markets are still being developed, the cost and margin structure for these businesses are also a work in progress. As a result, we have decided to exclude the Miller global brands from our pro forma results for periods prior to the close of the transaction. For the first three quarters of 2016, pro forma transaction adjusted EPS was $5.43 per diluted share, an increase of 4% versus $5.22 per diluted share for the first three quarters of 2015.", "Going on to our second metric, cost savings over the next three years; we have set and all-in target of $550 million which will be made up of ongoing cost savings in all of our businesses, as well as transaction related synergies, all of which will be delivered by the third full year of our combined company which is 2019. Approximately half of this three-year cost savings target is synergies which represents a synergy goal that is nearly 40% larger and 25% faster than the original $200 million synergies target over four years that we shared with you when we announced the transaction nearly a year ago.", "We expect the synergies delivery to be weighed towards years two and three while the other cost savings will be weighted toward years one and two of the program. As we have been discussing for the past year, we expect these cost savings to come primarily from the areas of global procurement and shared services along with North American supply chain, so they will primarily benefit the cost of goods sold line. As part of the planning process for the past year, we have also identified a moderate amount of savings from information systems. Please note, that we do not plan to provide additional specifics regarding annual phasing of the cost savings or a detailed breakout of transaction-related synergies versus other cost savings.", "Related to this cost savings goal, we anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of one-time incremental cash cost over three years to capture synergies, about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first two years of the program. Note that the incremental CapEx would be on top of our recent all in CapEx run rate of approximately $650 million to $700 million, plus or minus 10%, including 100% of MillerCoors CapEx in recent years. With a base CapEx spend of approximately $2.1 billion over the past three years, the CapEx needed to capture synergies represents an increment of less than 10% to our current run rate. We will continue to apply our pack model to these and all other significant potential capital and cash deployment decisions to help ensure that they are aligned with our priorities.", "Finally, as always, when these cost savings initiatives are completed in three years we will continue to pursue cost reductions across our business in order to provide resources to help drive our top line, bottom line and shareholder value.", "Finally, to help you model our business we also want to share our preliminary underlying free cash flow target for 2017, which is $1.1 billion plus or minus 10%. ", "Note, that this target includes the impact of incremental interest expense, U.S. tax expense, and synergies related CapEx in 2017, as well as the cash tax benefits resulting from the transaction. As in the past we plan to report back to you each year regarding how we are performing against these targets.", "So at this point I'll turn it back over to Mark for highlights of the transaction, business outlook, and Q&A. Mark.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Mauricio. This clearly is a historic time in the evolution of Molson Coors. Three weeks ago we completed our acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in the Miller Coors joint venture, along with the Miller global brand portfolio. We emerge as the world's third largest for bringing together Molson Coors and Miller Coors into a bigger, better organization, as one Company with an expanded portfolio of iconic brands, we intend to leverage or increase scale, resources, synergies and combine commercial experience to accelerate our First Choice agenda and deliver long-term shareholder value. ", "Because of this game changing transaction, Molson Coors now controls 100% of the highly strategic and attractive U.S. business, and will accelerate new growth the properties in emerging and developing beer markets globally with the Miller brand rights. This transaction also improves our operating efficiency and go to market strategy by changing our commercial capability in a truly global scale. ", "Financially, this is a compelling combination based on a very attractive price, ground operational synergies, substantial cash tax benefits, and the attractive financial package that we put in place earlier this year. As a reminder, for $12 billion of cash, we have purchased the remaining 58% of the Miller Coors joint venture that we didn't already own. ", "The ownership of the Miller brands, which outside of the U.S. we managed in more than 50 countries by our Molson Coors international, Molson Coors Canada and Molson Coors Europe businesses. Perpetual growth of free U.S. licensees for the existing ASP Miller import license brands, including Perrone, Fosters, gross and Reds [ph] for which Miller Coors most recently paid royalties of approximately $60 million in 2015. ", "And finally, because this is an asset transaction for U.S. tax purposes, we will receive immediate cash tax benefits that we now estimate will exceed $275 million annually, for the next 15 years. This represented an increase from a previous estimate of more than $250 million per year due to the detailed tax diligence work that we completed during last year. ", "The purchase price implies a headline enterprise by the multiple 11 times 2015 combined underlying EBITDA. When including the present value of the cash tax benefits to purchase multiple drops in effect of 9.2 times. These tax benefits are common with this type of asset transaction and they carry a high degree of certainty. As such we believe this is the most appropriate way to value this combination. ", "This represents a very attractive purchase multiple, even though it does not include the anticipated benefit of our transaction related synergies. We expect this combination to be accretive to underline diluted EPS and transaction adjusted EPS in the first full year of operations before synergies and we expect it to meet our Cardinal rates in year one, which is consistent with their disciplined use of cash framework. ", "Now, looking forward as a combined Company, our teams are focused on driving our First Choice agenda. Finishing the year with strong performance in each of our businesses and hitting the ground running and integration. You've heard us speak about these themes in the past for each of our businesses will continue to focus on transforming our portfolio to a the above premium segment, introducing value driving innovation, integrating the Miller brands and lifting and shifting best practices of talent across the global organization. ", "To provide just a few examples by business, in the U.S. [indiscernible] focus on the development integration of these new craft Partners, Saint Archer, Terrapin, Hop Valley and Revolver. And FNB's Henry led a new hard great flavor to its line of hard sodas, we will introduce a new line of hard sparkling waters to claim the growing alcohol sparkling water category. ", "Henry's Hard Sparkling will be launched nationally in March with lemon lime and passionfruit flavors. Reds and Blue Moon Belgian white introduce new aluminum pipe packaging in the second quarter of 2017. ", "Over the past few months we've built a strategy that elevates volume across our economy portfolio. For example, Miller High Life recently announced plans to reintroduce -- that brings back its classic jingle if you've got the time we've got the beer. We will also revamping its packaging for a further the unique heritage. ", "Elsewhere, across the economy portfolio, Hams will be reintroduced nationally at an opening price point in Milwaukee's Best is getting a total packaging update to give a fresh new look. And beginning early in 2017 we willfully revamp Keystone light including only packaging and advertising. For innovation in the value category, we are introducing spike watermelon reserve brand family and we are increasing the size of our PET bottle singles from 40 ounces to 42 ounces for the same price, again to deliver value to our consumers and customers.", "In Canada, our team is integrating the Miller brands back into our portfolio and will double down on the above premium MGD. We're also assessing the opportunities for Miller high life and other U.S brands that we can lift and shift into the Canada market. Mad Jack is performing well in the FNB space and we will consider other innovative options to drive value for our Canada consumers and customers. In Europe, we now have the Miller brands in the U.K and Ireland and this business is also repairing to begin managing the international license and export business in the region starting in January 1. This will allow us to drive and other league brands were fully aligned strategies across Europe. We will also continue to build our craft portfolio, including further expansion of Blue Moon across the region. ", "Our international business is well on the way to full integration of the Miller global brands into our portfolio, and we\u2019re leveraging a new footprint, strategy in emerging markets. For example, in Panama and Honduras where our Partners have already embraced Coors Light we are ready to accelerate growth with the addition of the Miller brands. The international team has also begun planning process for transitioning to Puerto Rico over from Miller Coors on January 1. Going forward Coors and Miller brands will be priority brands for international business. ", "To summarize, we are delighted to have completed the MillerCoors transaction which is a compelling, strategic and financial opportunity for our Company and our shareholders that catapults Molson Coors to the next level. In this combination key priorities in three specific areas. Firstly, in brand lead growth the cash tax benefits and cost savings made possible by this transaction will provide resources that we can invest and accelerating the transformation of the front end of our business through, for example, investing behind our core brand across all of our geographies, premiumizing our portfolio and engaging with consumers in new ways, including cross-border exchange of category changing innovation, expanding the depth and reach of our international brands and fast growing markets, including securing a certain and aligned future for the Miller brands globally, and finally, leveraging our shared commercial capability through extraordinary brand building, world-class insight, digital leadership and unrivaled customer excellence. ", "Secondly, this transformation of our Company offers unique opportunities for us to drive cash generation, through substantial tax benefits, cross synergies, cross-border working capital improvements and disciplined use of our pack model across the combined Company. We expect all of these benefits to provide strong free cash flow and allow us to quickly pay down acquisition debt and maintain our commitment to investment-grade debt ratings. ", "And thirdly, this transaction represents a prudent high return use of cash for Molson Coors on our shareholders. We're using this transaction only to make Molson Coors a bigger Company, but also a better Company with our integration complexity normally found in a deal of this size. ", "As we focus on deleveraging our balance sheet over the next two to three years, we expanded our share repurchase program and have announced we plan to maintain our current dividend of share level and we will revisit our dividend policy once deleveraging is well underway. ", "Overall, this combination is a game changer in our ambition to become First Choice for consumers and customers, and it's highly consistent with our goals and our focus on building extraordinary brands, delivering innovation and driving significant volume to our shareholders. ", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks will be on our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Also, at 1:00 PM Eastern time today Dave Dunnewald, will host a follow-up conference call which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our Quarterly Results. This call will also be available for you to hear be a webcast on our website. ", "At this point, Chad, we would like to open up for questions, please. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly, thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please go ahead.", "Wendy Nicholson", "Good morning. Just a quick clarifying question. That $1.1 billion free cash I never did that include or exclude the cost required to get your synergies? Just a housekeeping item? And then second thing, of the $559 of savings to come, can you talk specifically about how much reinvestment specifically in advertising you expect to redeploy? I know some of the strength in Coors Light is probably a function of the fact that spending is up a lot in the year-to-date period in the U.S, so I'm just wondering about sort of targeted reinvestment level you can help us? Thanks. ", "Mark Hunter", "Hi, Wendy, thanks for your questions, two questions. Let me just touch on the savings number and then Mauricio can just clarify in the free cash flow number. With regards to savings we don't offer guidance as to how we will allocate those savings through our business. I don't want to constrain our business with any specific formula. And clearly as we drive the savings they will either drop to the bottom line or be reinvested back into our business or offset for example inflation on our business. We continue to review our Sales and Marketing investment on a geography by geography basis. We now have a return on marketing investment model which is allowing us to drive significant efficiencies in our marketing spend, and we will continue to monitor our level of spend in each of our markets to make sure we can support our brands and a way that allows them to be competitive but were not going to offer specific guidance on allocation of those savings. On the free cash flow number, Mauricio do you want to just clarify? ", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Yes. Good morning, Wendy. The $1.1 billion is after taking into account the cost required to deliver the synergies. ", "Wendy Nicholson", "Got it, but just as follow-up to conceptual I know you said in your remarks that you're pleased that the Coors Light brand held scores have improved. To what do you attribute that? I mean again we track the advertising spending and it looks like that's gone up a lot in the US but is there other stuff specifically that you can call out that you're doing weather is distribution, whether it's work with your salesforce that leading to the stronger brand held scores per se? ", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, we could get lost in lots of detail here, Wendy, and across all of our businesses using Coors Light go from strength to strength and I think what's at the heart of that is the clarity of the positioning of the brand which is distinctive and consistent. So I've said in the past I would rather spend less money on a great idea that more money on a poor idea and actually I think we\u2019ve got clarity on a position in a great creative platform certainly across our international U.S and our European business. We have now started to transfer the U.S creative platform into our Canada business as well and as we've done that we've seen our brand held scores accelerate in Canada to the last couple of quarters though I really think it comes down to the differentiation and consistency of the positioning. ", "Wendy Nicholson", "Fair enough, thank you. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Wendy. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Vivien Azer", "Hi, good morning. ", "Mark Hunter", "Hey, Vivien. ", "Vivien Azer", "So firstly on the consolidated cost savings number clearly encouraging you being able to upsize that and pull that forward. Would you be able to offer any incremental color on what gives you that enhanced confidence around the total cost save realization? Thanks. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Vivien. Let me deal with that. So if you remember at the time we announced the agreement to acquire Miller's tours business we did some quick reasonably well informed analysis on the cost savings opportunity and we suggested it would be around $200 million over four years. Will have the benefit of very, very detailed planning over the course of the last eight or nine months and that work has unearthed further opportunities and really in the detailed planning that's allowed us to move with more pace and set a target that's materially higher than our initial target. ", "Vivien Azer", "But just in terms of the three buckets that you guys had previously identified is there anyone bucket that's driving and outsize contribution to that more constructive view? ", "Mark Hunter", "We haven't given any color on the proportionality of the cost savings, but the three areas that we've flagged historically in terms of procurement, North American supply chain, shared services, we've endorsed those numbers that we had originally and some areas they have improved. And in addition to that we've unlocked some additional synergies in the area of IT systems as we consolidate are IT infrastructure and worker pushing out into areas around commercial as well particularly North American level as we look at efficiency of our accretive platforms there, so. But in the roundness still pretty much the same errors we identified initially and hopefully would expect that because of familiarity with the Business is high. So we went into this with a reasonably good estimate of where we could drive the volume. ", "Vivien Azer", "Perfect. That's very helpful, thanks. Moving on to Canada, I would have expected a slightly better outcome given the level of investment spending that we saw in two Q4 so I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on that? I think you noted the softness in mainstream so it's really a two-part question, do you think that the indefinite spending is doing what it needs to? And does he think ahead to 2017, what potential impact he think is the legalization of recreational cannabis can have on the beer industry in Canada? Thanks. ", "Mark Hunter", "I would describe it as a broad-spectrum test on your two question everything I was expecting the second part of that so while I'm chatting Stewart get thinking. Me just a couple of comments on the first part dumps and performance in the quarter. Our strategy remains consistent in Canada around making sure that we modernize our supply train and drive our cost down taking for their cost out of our business and improving our overall commercial performance. You aware of some of the changes we made at the leadership level and as Fred is number two in the customer area, across moved from Europe their focus will be on commercial execution really driving our field sales management and model and really I think the plane more assertive execution in the marketplace. That started to show up in some of our information measures. But Stewart, do you want to offer just a little more color on the third quarter? Things that you're pleased about and then if you could think about the recreational drugs question as well perspective on that would be helpful? ", "Stewart Glendinning", "Yes guess 100%, Mark. So looking at the third quarter, three big drivers of the results. First FX -- transactional FX related to US sourcing of raw materials, lower volumes and higher marketing spend. And on the volume side as Mark pointed out that we are seeing some reaches. We have been growing share in the provinces the West which is having a difficult area for us in September as we saw progress through the third quarter September actually was flat share in Ontario big beer market for us with a growing share in the LC BOM on present. So the number of tough areas is actually shrinking and I think our increased execution certainly will help that. At the same time the higher levels of marketing spend are yielding positive improvements in our brand scores, and of course we expect that we will be able to translate that into improved volumes so that's I'll pause for a second because there's nothing else before I talk about cannabis? ", "Vivien Azer", "That's really helpful and thanks for indulging the cannabis question. ", "Stewart Glendinning", "Cannabis is something that we are thinking very carefully about not only as a business but also as an industry. And there's a lot of talk certainly about what it's going -- how it's going to be used and where it's going to be deployed et cetera, but there's just a lot we don't know at the moment. And so we're not even really 100% on clear where it will be sold, when it will be sold, and in the best place I would suggest to look for guidance on what the impact might be would be probably to look at a state like Colorado and see what that has done to beer. But for the moment, we are studying she goes because of the lack of clarity about the deployment of the drug itself. ", "Vivien Azer", "Fair enough. Thank you. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Stewart. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Judy Hong", "Thank you, good morning. ", "Mark Hunter", "Good morning Judy. ", "Judy Hong", "So a few questions, first, Mauricio, the transaction adjusted EPS for 2015 that's now $6.11 versus the $5.72 that you have given us at the September conference, so it went up by $0.39. I think the cash tax went up by $0.12 and I think the book amortization actually went down, so can you just rip them $5.50 to $6.11 what's gone up in that adjustment? ", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Yes, thank you, Judy so the two items that you mention are correct. What I refer you to the call that we are going to have afterwards led by Dave and you will be able to bridge that. Now the other factor that you are missing there, is the fact that our interest cost went down from that preliminary number of $5.72 that we had given use of the third component that gets you to the EPS, but we will give you a more detailed walk on the comp. ", "Dave Dunnewald", "Judy, we can give you more details on the call a little bit later but at least the initial headline is that the bridge sorry the pro forma that we put out in May, that you are referring to for the $5.72 transaction adjusted EPS included bridge financing for US GAAP. And then of course the financing we actually put in place for the long-term funding of the transaction actually in a very favorable rates much more favorable than the bridge loan financing, and so that's the driver of lower interest expense. ", "Judy Hong", "Are the $5.70 is the number you given us in September, correct? I don't think that was the May number. ", "Dave Dunnewald", "Okay, well, adjustment interest rate, additional refinement of purchase accounting and, right, and the adjustment of cash tax benefits related to the transaction. ", "Judy Hong", "Okay we can follow up later. And then Mauricio, just on the free-cash flow follow-up. So, can you give us the underlying pro forma free cash flow for either 2015 or 2016? Because I'm just trying to get to the $1.1 billion based on kind of the transaction adjusted EPS numbers that you've given us and it seems to imply very little underlying growth and I'm just trying to see if I'm reading it correctly. ", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Yes, Judy, look at this point we are just given -- we are going to give you the underlying free cash flow projection for 2017. I would encourage you to a little bit later on we post to the pro forma on our website, you can do your calculations there. Obviously, when you do kind of the back of the envelope math that you can do there, you would think about the free cash flow generation for MillerCoors [ph] and the free cash the generation for Molson Coors [ph] pre the acquisition and you would get to a level of maybe $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion. Now there are obviously some tailwinds that are represented in the form of the $275 million of cash tax benefits but also some headwinds because we have a significant interest expense increase of around $250 million per annum because of the acquisition financing. ", "There is additional G&A expense from the step up, due to the fair value re-measurement required by purchase accounting of around $17 million, and there's higher income taxes because now we on the other 58% of MillerCoors so we\u2019re paying additional taxes of around $200 or we will be paying additional taxes around $200 million in 2017 versus what we did before. ", "Judy Hong", "Okay and the three and $59 of cash restructuring charge is all that hitting in 2017? ", "Mauricio Restrepo", "No, that $350 million number is what we will be spending, that will be a one-time expenditure but it will be spread over the three-year period. ", "Judy Hong", "Okay. And then maybe, Gavin, just wanted to get your perspective on the volume performance for MillerCoors in the third quarter. Obviously the industry has been a little bit soft, clearly you still have a vision to get to flat volume by 2018 but just seems like that's a pretty challenging order given the recent trend so do you think that you need to really step up investments even more on some of your key brands? Or do you think this is really just a broader industry problem? ", "Mark Hunter", "Hey Gavin, do you want to speak to that directly? ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes, sure, thanks, Mark and thanks, Judy. Look you are right, three SCR volumes were down across all brand segments and reflective of the industry. Just as far as our expectations for, do you remember the long-term goals? So expectations are still to be flat in 2018 with growth in 2019, and yes we did see soft industry trends and you see that in our STR figure. But we have now for three straight quarters closed our volume gap with the industry. We've got some work to do on the segment, but we really like our portfolio there with the largest craft brand in the country with Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's was in the top five as well, as we made four acquisitions we're pleased about them, we've grown our flavored malt beverage shared meaningfully over the last year or so. ", "Our premium brands continue to perform well. Miller Lite gained share of the premium line segment for the eighth consecutive quarter, Judy, and Coors Light gain share for the sixth consecutive quarter we\u2019ve reengaged the economy drinker and it's a high priority for us. And we've refinanced our economy strategy at the full distributor meeting, that was well received by our distribution network. Our above premium performance specifically was hindered by some of the performance on Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, but particular seasonally and variety packs and as an industrywide trend and an issue we are addressing we have execution plans for early next year, but we are pleased with our performance on a brand like Grapefruit Shandy which doubled its volume. ", "So overall, Judy, it's one quarter and I'm pleased with the performance overall, particularly from a share point of view. ", "Judy Hong", "Got it. Okay thank you, everyone. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Judy. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Pablo Zuanic, SIG. Please go ahead.", "Pablo Zuanic", "Good morning, everyone. I want us two questions. The first one bigger picture something that every investor I talked to asks me is what\u2019s the track record of Mark Hunter and why are they the right people to execute here? And of course I asked the question with great respect, right but people look on Felipe having been for 20 years, so what want to understand when we look at MillerCoors of years ago 40 years now Gavin, so if you can answer the question in terms of what your track record, and why should investors be comfortable that this is the right management team to execute this significant plan? And the second question maybe is more for Mauricio, just basically in terms of numbers. I guess there's different ways to judge the guidance that you've given us today. One way I judge it as I look at the cost savings that MillerCoors generate over the last five years on average, about $129 million per annum, $88 million last year, running about $80 million this year, another $99 this year for the third quarter. So you can have $120 million on average over the last five years. ", "But then I look at the synergy number you're giving us today, $275 million divided by three is $92 million and then I take out from the balance the Molson Coors saving -- is another $52 million of cost savings, so synergies plus cost savings at MillerCoors and I know that the lines get blurred right about $124 million per annum, over the next three years; which is what MillerCoors did over the last five years. So I am not so sure to be -- how to judge that number nice if you can sustain it, but if this is this significant transaction and there's this plethora of opportunities that we talked about in these cost savings, because you are wonderful Company, why would the cost savings, $124 million as per my math total would be similar to what you been doing for the last five years? I guess if you can answer -- well, those of the two questions. Thank you. ", "Mark Hunter", "Pablo, it is Mark here. Clearly to your first question I'm not going to conduct a performance review over our quarterly earnings call or get into detail as to why our board believes that I am the right leader for this business and why I believe Gavin is the right leader for this business. I will let the track record speak for ourselves, we are both seasoned professionals who have been the beer industry for a long period of time, given significant change across many businesses, integrated businesses like Starbucks [ph] and driven this transaction at a rate on which on a valuation multiple, I think it is utterly compelling for our business so I'll just leave it there, I'm not going to talk in any more detail with you on that.", "Let me just backup one second you asked for Mauricio. What we have endeavored to do here is get full transparency and is sure that we are not duplicating any of the cost savings in our business and clearly we've now set a target for the next three years. We will update that on an annual basis. There was a lot of questions around synergies number and we have scale that up and picked up pace in the synergies number, and we've ensure that there is no duplication with the synergies they are not underlying cost-saving. And we will continue to test our sales if whether that number can be further improved, as we actually get into fully running the Business. But we feel it's a number we can meet and we will attempt to beat it makes sense as we look out at our business which, if you remember has very, very little geographical overlap we are going to try this by a number of restructuring initiatives, setting up things like shared services globally and we will get at that and we will update you if there is any new news on that number but we feel it's the right number for our business at this point in time. ", "Pablo Zuanic", "Thank you. And just a very quick follow-up regarding cadence I know you're not willing to talk about savings are accretive to the bottom line, but would you be reasonable to assume given that you have this target of stabilizing volumes by 2018 and growing after that, that a lot of the savings would really invest initially we should be thinking more year three and four seeing the accretion decline if you could comment on that that's all. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks Pablo. Again I haven't given any guidance as to how we apportion cost savings, one of things that did indicate earlier this year was that we have now developed a small global growth group led by Kandy. That team will be looking for incremental opportunities to accelerate our topline performance clearly some of those opportunities will require incremental investment in our business. But we will look at those in the round as we aggregate our total Sales and Marketing spend across our business. I'm more interested in the quality of our marketing and I think there's plenty of examples. There's one of the US market one where people are competitors have been spending very aggressively but let's just say that incremental spend always buy you success. ", "I'm really focused on the quality and the marketing and the discipline of our execution, and will continue to drive efficiencies across our marketing spend, and if there's a return that makes sense for us as we will put it through the pack model and we will spend incrementally to generate additional return. We want to drive very hard on getting the top line moving in that will be a focus for us over the course of the next 24 to 36 month. I won't get any more specific. ", "Operator", "Thank you, the next question comes from Mark Swartzberg, Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Yes, thanks good morning, gentlemen. A couple on the free cash flow and then a couple in the US. On the free cash flow the $1.1 million you mentioned that includes these one-time cash costs. How much of that $350 million is actually in that $1.1 billion? And how much as an expense item and how much as a capital expenditure item? And then are there other one-time items in there? On a per share basis we are at $509 million a free cash flow, you basically tone is the transaction adjusted EPS will be down in calendar 2017 or you are saying there is some pretty significant CapEx, I am just trying to understand what else is going on in that number? ", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Yes hi, Mark this is a Mauricio. Look we haven't given a specific breakout of the $250 million than to say about half of that would be additional CapEx and half of that would be additional OpEx. Know if you think about the nature of the cost savings are going to deliver including the synergies a lot of the delivery of the synergies will be happening probably towards the latter part of the three-year period which means that actually the investment to deliver those synergies will be weighted towards years one and two. We haven't really given it a specific amount of how much of that will specifically hit 2017. As for the headwinds and tailwinds, the $275 million of cash tax savings obviously that's a tailwind for the next 15 years. The additional interest expense, because of the Company financing, again that something that is going to be there for the foreseeable future, as will the additional DNA expense. Obviously even though that's a non-cash item but something is honestly also going to be there is a generator of those cash tax savings. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "Okay. I'm still confused only because I'm sitting here with $611 million in your saying this year that number is growing, so call it $6.20, $6.25 represents an transaction adjusted EPS and then the free cash flow view is $5.09 so we are at more than $1 below the transaction adjusted EPS number, which implies again it implies some pretty significant CapEx or something else is going on in transaction adjusted EPS again which is all pro forma for this transaction and doesn't have the international brand so maybe it's a 1:00 o\u2019clock-- so I'm still not I don't know if you have a response to the, yes? ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Rather than get into the weeds on this call, can I suggest we heard the question and I can give you an answer, so Dave and the team will pick it up this afternoon we will try to give you a bridge to give you the clarity. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "Okay. Fair enough that would be great. ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Best way to deal with the question, appreciate the question we will get a response and take you through that and this afternoon's call. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "Fair enough and just shifting to the U.S, I just a curious, Mark or Gavin, craft has been weak for everybody, so just from a broader industry perspective, why do you think craft has gotten weaker sequentially? And how enduring do you think that is? I know that's hard to have a crystal ball there but what do you think that is? And then, just mechanically for the U.S. business it seems like your distributor inventories are higher than you'd like them to be so is it reasonable to think your own shipments will lag your STRS in the fourth quarter? ", "Mark Hunter", "So Mark let me split that into two so Gavin, I will pass it across to you on the STRS section in a second, let me offer a couple of headlines around craft. I don't think it's true to say the craft is for weak for everybody, that's a really general statement I think there's a number of craft companies that continue to show very strong growth, and we just acquired a number of them which is a good thing for a business. I think what you are starting to see though in the marketplace is what I describe is probably over supply of flavors and SKUs or beer spirals and SKUs in both retailers and consumers are trying to make sense of the plethora of choice and thus against the backdrop the craft has been good for the beer industry, because it's driven conversations and interest in beer to probably an all-time high, but you get to the point where each SKU has to deliver on a velocity basis and has to actually demonstrate its value to customers and consumers. ", "As Gavin mentioned earlier things like seasonal packs, which have been a big driver of the craft industry have really started to come under pressure, because consumers are now in essence making up their own seasonal packs by the way that they actually shop the shelf. But I think what you're starting to see is from a retailer perspective; they really simplified offering and Walmart just did that recently as they reset all of their shelf sets, so the more progressive retailers are really trying to focus on those brands that have got long-term distinctive positioning\u2019s, and drive velocity per SKU. Also thing from a consumer perspective, because most of the craft growth has been driven in the back of heavily held IPAs consumers are recognizing; those beers are great but they are not beers you can probably take with you through a long occasion, and we are actually starting to see some consumers step back into some of the American light brands.", "I think it is just craft starting to kind of shake itself out with the brands that are well positioned, clearly distinctive and alongside that the retailers really starting to simplify their offer, and that's incentive at the moment but that starting to have an impact on overall kind of craft velocity or craft trends. Gavin you want to anything to that. And then pick up the STW STRS puff question? ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Thanks, anything I can add to that, pretty much what you said, I mean there's tons of choice and there's not a lot of floor space, velocity retail is important, so that's why our building with beer program which we launched [indiscernible] had such a positive impact with beer buyers at retail, not only on premise but also off premise. As far as the STWs STRS are concerned, Mark, fundamentally that's just a difference in timing. If you remember at the end of Q2, that dynamic was reversed with domestic STW s down and STRS were down less than that. On a year-to-date basis, those two numbers are much closer and generally, we try and align those things much closer by the end of the year as we try to ship to consumption. I wouldn't get too worked up on quarter-over-quarter because of timing on those price increases and so on. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "That's great. And if I could real quick and that's very helpful, July 4, Anheuser-Busch [ph] have called out the timing of July 4 as affecting the industry? Do you think the timing of July hurt the industry in the third quarter? ", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, it did, yes. I would agree with that statement. ", "Mark Swartzberg", "Great. All right, thanks, Mark. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Bryan Spillane", "Good morning, everybody. I'm going to hold off on the free cash flow question until 1:00 o'clock. Dave, this could be one of the most anticipated 1:00 o'clock calls in a while, I think. So my question is just related to the cost savings and if you could give us some outside of the synergies, if you could give us an sense of like what's included and what's not? You've got the process you're going through in Vancouver in terms of selling the brewery and you'll migrate to a new brewery there. I guess there is a potential the same thing could happen in Montreal. Is Eden, North Carolina brewery in that inside the savings number? Just any sense of some of those bigger items that may be in there would be helpful?", "Mark Hunter", "Mauricio do you want to? ", "Mauricio Restrepo", "Yes. Hi, Brian. So with respect to the cost savings -- I mean some of the items that you allude to, that you alluded to during your questions are indeed in there. So for example, the savings that will come from the Eden Brewery closure are included in there. The work that we are continuously doing in terms of looking at our procurement in addition to the savings related to procurement that are in the synergy number and as Mark referenced to earlier, we made a concerted effort to ensure that we've separated what is sort of business as usual savings which as you know a way of doing business here from the piece that's going to come specifically from the synergies. There are also other savings that are coming from looking at our supply chain network that are not included in the synergy piece of the optimization of the North America supply chain grid. So just a lot of savings that are coming from our business as usual run-of-the-mill, running the business vis-\u00e0-vis the synergies that have specifically to do with those three buckets that we alluded to earlier.", "Mark Hunter", "Brian, this is Mark. The other context point I will give you is over the course of the last three or four years, at an enterprise level we've tried to drive forward what we've described as a one way principles. So across our major functional areas to try and drive for consistency of approach and whether that's world-class supply chain, HR one way, and we're now introducing that from a commercial perspective in terms of our commercial excellence approach, really trying to drive for best practice orientation and consistency of approach wherever we can in the business and that's been one of the drivers for unlocking additional efficiency savings through our business. I think a big part has been in our world-class supply chain where we truly believe that we are world-class or close to world-class in many areas. So we will continue to crack the handle on that and drive as much value and efficiency as we can out of those areas while overlooking the synergy opportunity as well.", "Bryan Spillane", "All right, thanks, gentlemen. We'll catch up at 1:00 o'clock. ", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Brian. Nice to have you back. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Great. Gavin, we understand certainly the goals on the improvement in the volumes and trajectory for 2018-2019. If that doesn't pan out and if we have a continuation of the current trends -- what sort of opportunities would there be do you think in terms of managing the brewery footprint to address that?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Mark, do you mind if I take the question direct? ", "Mark Hunter", "No, just on you go Gavin and I will give you some\u2026", "Gavin Hattersley", "I was talking to Robert, I'm not planning to fail, right. I think we've got the right plans, the right strategies, the right brands and the right people to get this done. And I wouldn't look at this on a simple quarter basis this is a longer term plan, the industry had a tough quarter, it's surely but our expectations are still flat in 2018 with growth in 2019, and I can run you through all the high-level plans that we've got on our brands but I'm -- we as a business are certainly focused on that goal and believe we will achieve it.", "Mark Hunter", "And Robert, Miller color there is, as an enterprise level we're committed to supporting putting Gavin and the team to make that happen. There has been lots of questions over the course of the last 12 to 18 months on how will we get there and we've tried to release simplified thinking into three specific areas; our economy, our below premium strategy, and many of you have asked about clarity on our thinking there, that's now been clarified and launched and generated a lot of excitement with their distributors. Many of you have asked about our ability to get Coors Light and Miller Lite growing at the same time and we are now doing that consistently and alongside them Coors Banquet is going from strength to strength.", "And we continue to drive the premiumization of our portfolio on the craft acquisitions and Henry's are great examples. Don't forget that Red's which is now such a significant brand didn't even exist just over three years ago. And my view is that we still have untapped opportunities in our own portfolio as well. So all of the component parts are there, a lot of it is down to how worthless we want to be from an execution perspective. But Gavin and the leadership team have driven a significant change in the ambition and energy and focus in our U.S. business and it's been great to see that happening and some quarters will be tougher than others but we are absolutely resolute on our ambition to get this business back into growth trajectory and as Gavin said, that's over the course of the next couple of years.", "Rob Ottenstein", "That's terrific. On the international side, can you give us -- and I know some of this may have come out earlier on in the prelude but can you give us an update of where you are on the Miller brands globally and had there been any new agreements in terms of supply and distribution?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes. So let me ask you Kandy [ph], who is obviously transitioning at the moment from his previous role across the Stuart but Kandy's been leading that stream of work. So Kandy do you want to just offer some highlights around that at this stage?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Sure. Hi, Robert. So we've got progress in terms of planning and executing a transition of the Miller brands into our systems because it was relatively easier in places like Canada and the UK which came on to our business footprint. We have the cities or markets where we've had existing partners; Panama, Honduras, as an example where we moved the distribution on to our existing partners in the markets which were new to us. We have established with one or two exceptions, almost all of them new distribution agreements that are in place. In terms of production, we are aligned either on our infrastructure like MillerCoors and in certain cases, we are continuing to rely on transitional service agreements by ABI; and we will be working to transition those into our own system as well. But overall, I'm very pleased and Stewart, Simon, Fred are all involved this in terms of transitioning over into our set up, our initial two to three weeks has gone without any significant issues, and so we are quite pleased with the transition.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Are you able to discuss who any of the -- in the more notable markets, are you able to discuss who any of the new Partners are?", "Mark Hunter", "We haven't made any kind of public statements around that other than in markets like Panama, we have an existing partner there and we've transitioned across but I think I would probably save that maybe until our Q4 February call. Robert can give a filler update just because we are working through some of the finer detail at this point in time but where there is not a partner in place, there are TSA's, transitional service agreements in place and as I mentioned earlier, I mean some of the markets are doing better than we anticipated, some of the markets are going to take a bit more work to get back on the front so as you would expect in a transition of this nature but we'll get probably more color and a fuller update on our February call.", "Rob Ottenstein", "Great. Well thank you very much.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Robert.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks. ", "Mark Hunter", "I just like to thank everybody for their continued interest at Molson Coors. We've opened a new chapter in the history of our business and as a leadership team, we are delighted to be leading the business forward from this position. And we look forward to updating you as we make our business bigger and stronger in the coming quarters ahead. So thank you for your continued interest in our business.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Before, we begin I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. ", "Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today. So please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.", "The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.", "Regarding any U.S. -- non-U.S. GAAP measures that may be discussed during the call and from time to time by the company's executives in discussing the company's performance, please visit the website -- the company's website www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.", "Also, unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior year and in U.S. dollars, and the consolidated and U.S. segment results are presented versus pro-forma results a year ago, which reflects the acquisition of MillerCoors as is, and the related financing had occurred January 1 of 2016.", "Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors. Please go ahead sir.", "Mark Hunter", "Thank you, Denise. Hello and welcome everybody to the Molson Coors earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. ", "With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Stewart Glendinning, our international CEO; Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the VP of Investor Relations.", "On the call today, Tracey and I, will take you through highlights of our first quarter 2017 results for Molson Coors Brewing Company, along with some perspective from the remainder of 2017. First quarter underlying earnings were lower than last year, primarily due to higher brand amortization expense and weaker January and February volumes in the U.S. this year, and because we're cycling strong earnings comparators from last year.", "First quarter underlying after-tax income in 2016 increased more than 35% from the year before on a pro forma basis, partly due to the benefit of inventory dynamics and the timing of the Easter holiday. We've also made incremental investments this year to strengthen our global business and capabilities.", "Despite a softer start this year, volume trends have improved since January and February. We're making great progress with our First Choice agenda in each of our businesses, and we're confident of delivering our full year business plans.", "With the completion of the MillerCoors transaction late last year and the changes we're making to align and enhance our organization, 2017 will be a transition year as we build a larger, stronger company. Consistent with this, our results today reflect increased investments in the building blocks that will drive top-line growth, cost savings, profit growth, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead. ", "These building blocks are led by our First Choice for consumer and customer agenda, and are grouped into four areas. First, our organization and brands are now all under one roof. We are lifting and shifting best practices and world-class supply chain capabilities, and we're establishing global centers of excellence.", "Second, our consumer excellence approach. As part of our First Choice agenda, we'll be building four-brand trademarks across multiple international markets. These four trademarks are Coors, Miller, Staropramen and Blue Moon. Within these trademarks, the global priority brands in 2017 are Coors Light, Coors Banquet, Miller Lite, MGD, Staropramen portfolio and Blue Moon Belgian White, which also includes Belgian Moon in Canada. We will reaffirm or update the global priority brands on an annual basis. These global brands supported by our national champion, craft and specialty brands now give the platform for accelerating performance outside of our core developed markets over time.", "Third, our customer excellence approach. We're investing heavily in sales capability and execution improvement, including our new global commercial team First Choice learning center and a suite of leading edge sales technology and tools.", "And lastly, our focus on talent development. Diversity and inclusion will help to drive our First Choice agenda and leadership capability across the enterprise.", "In business highlights for the first quarter, we grew worldwide total brand volume 2.1% and our global priority brands by 6.6% in the quarter. We increased global net sales per hectoliter by 3.9% in constant currency versus the pro forma results last year driven by all of our businesses. ", "We delivered transaction related cash tax benefits of $97 million in the quarter, more than 40% higher than our original planning expectation for the transaction. We now expect these cash tax benefits for full-year 2017 to be nearly $390 million, up from $275 million previously. And this represents an acceleration of these benefits, which were originally expected to be delivered more evenly over the next 15 years.", "In the first quarter, we reported nearly $515 million of underlying EBITDA, a 3% decrease from the pro forma result, a year ago. However, in constant currency, our underlying EBITDA was unchanged year-on-year.", "Underlying after-tax income was $165.6 million or $0.76 per diluted share. This result was down 12.1% on a pro forma basis, but more than 45% on a reported basis, which demonstrates a substantial earnings accretion from the transaction, even in a softer quarter.", "Now, I'd like to share some regional highlights from the first quarter. In the U.S., on a pro forma basis, MillerCoors' domestic net revenue per hectoliter, which excludes contract brewing and company-owned distributor sales, grew 0.2% for the quarter, as a result of favorable net pricing, partially offset by negative sales mix. We grew our share of the Premium Light segment with Coors Light completing its eighth consecutive quarter of increased segment share, while Miller Lite reached 10 consecutive quarters of increased segment share.", "Coors Banquet has grown STRs for 10 consecutive years and accelerated its volume growth trends in the past two quarters. In above-premium, Blue Moon Belgian White returned to volume growth of low single-digits in the quarter. While the Leinenkugel's Shandy portfolio grew mid-single digits, Peroni volume was up high single digits having its best quarterly performance since the first quarter of 2012. Henry's Hard Soda, which was cycling successful launch last year along with REDD's posted lower volume in the quarter. ", "Our below-premium brands declined low single digits, a significant trend improvement from the past several years, led by low single digit growth in Miller High Life, which had its best STR performance since the third quarter of 2009.", "Keystone also grew achieving its best STR performance since the second quarter of 2010. Steel Reserve Alloy Series grew low double digits, while Hamm's STRs increased in the high teens, Milwaukee's Best declined low double digits in the quarter. Overall, U.S. STRs declined 2% for the quarter. ", "Cost of goods sold per hectoliter increased 1.7% driven by higher input costs and volume de-leverage, partially offset by supply chain cost savings.", "First quarter underlying EBITDA was $441.9 million, a 3.7% decrease versus prior year driven by lower volume and higher COGS per hectoliter, partially offset by lower brand investments and employee related expenses as well as net pricing growth. For perspective, our U.S. business was cycling a 17.7% increase in underlying EBITDA in the first quarter of 2016.", "In Canada, net sales per hectoliter in local currency increased 3.9% driven by positive pricing and brand mix. Coors Light and Molson Canadian volumes declined in the quarter, but their share trends improved versus the fourth quarter of last year, especially in Quebec and the West. Overall, Canada brand volume grew at 0.7% and we increased market share in the first quarter. ", "We also continue to premiumize our portfolio through volume and market share growth in our import brands led by Coors Banquet, Above-Premium craft brands, through Mad Jack, Belgian Moon and Granville Island and Creemore, along with the return of the Miller brands to our Canada portfolio.", "Canada COGS per hectoliter increased 10.7% in local currency, driven by mix shift to higher cost import brands, input cost inflation, including unfavorable transactional foreign currency impacts, and cycling a temporary reduction in distribution costs last year, with a partial offset overall from cost savings.", "Canada underlying EBITDA decreased 25% to $42.9 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as we cycled a number of supply chain one-off benefits in 2016, along with increased commercial investments this year.", "Europe net sales increased 19.1% in local currency for the quarter, driven by the release of indirect tax provision of approximately $50 million that we established last quarter, as well as the transfer of royalty and export brands from MCI, the addition of the Miller global brands and strong volume growth by Coors Light and Staropramen.", "Our portfolio premiumization and mix management continued to drive positive mix in Europe. The strength of our Above-Premium brands including Coors Light, Staropramen inside of the Czech Republic, Sharp's portfolio, Franciscan Well and Rekorderlig Cider led to a 9.6% increase in brand volume in the region. The addition of the Miller brands and the royalty and export brands from MCI also contributed to volume growth and more than offset the negative impact of the late Easter holiday this year. ", "COGS per hectoliter in local currency increased 1.7% primarily due to mix shift to higher cost products and geographies.", "First quarter underlying EBITDA increased more than 7% to 8% in Europe due to release of the indirect tax provision, higher volumes, and increased net pension benefit. These positive factors were partially offset by an approximate $11 million bad debt provision established related to our customer in Croatia, along with higher brand investments, the timing of Easter holiday and unfavorable foreign currency movements.", "Our international business increased brand volume more than 65% to 1 million hectoliters and almost doubled its net sales in the first quarter. This increase was driven by the transfer of our Puerto Rico business from MillerCoors and the addition of the Miller global brands as well as Coors Light growth in Latin America, partially offset by the transfer of Europe royalty and export business to the Europe segment.", "In Latin America, excluding the addition of Puerto Rico, we grew Coors Light volume at high single-digit rate, which was driven by countries such as Mexico, Colombia and the Dominican Republic. Underlying EBITDA was $5 million, up from a loss of $1.4 million a year ago due to higher volume, positive pricing and favorable sales mix changes.", "The Miller brands integration process is advancing as expected. We're leveraging existing platforms and partnerships in certain countries, while establishing new supply chains and partnerships in other attractive new markets. As an example, in Mexico, we're leveraging our relationship with Heineken and in Australia we're partnering with Coca-Cola Amatil to distributable both the Miller and Coors brands. We've also gained important businesses in new markets such as South Korea and South Africa.", "Now, I'll turn over to Tracey to give first quarter financial highlights and perspective on the remainder of 2017.", "Tracey?", "Tracey Joubert", "Thank you, Mark. And hello everybody. As a result of the MillerCoors transaction, today's results for the consolidated company and U.S. business are being presented in comparison to 2016 pro forma results, which are presented as if the transaction and its financing had been completed at the beginning of 2016. The segmental results for Canada, Europe, international and corporate are not being presented on a pro forma basis. With that in mind, following are our consolidated financial headlines for the first quarter versus pro forma results a year ago.", "Net sales were down 0.5% in U.S. dollars in the first quarter, primarily due to lower U.S. sales volume and unfavorable currency movements, which were partially offset by the release of the indirect tax provision in Europe.", "On a consistent currency basis, our net sales per hectoliter increased 3.9% in the quarter, driven by growth across all our businesses.", "On a U.S. GAAP basis, we reported net income from continuing operations attributable to Molson Coors of $201.9 million for the first quarter, down from $257.4 million of pro forma net income a year ago. This decrease was driven by lower special and other non-core items this year, along with lower U.S. volume, mix shift toward higher cost products, and higher global corporate costs.", "Our first quarter underlying after-tax income was $165.6 million or $0.76 per diluted share, which was 12.1% lower than the prior year, driven by lower income in the U.S. and Canada, as well as higher global corporate costs.", "Additional brand amortization expense of approximately $10 million in Canada was primarily related to changing the Molson brands to definite life in the fourth quarter last year. Underlying EBITDA in the quarter was $514.9 million, 3.6% lower than the pro forma results from a year ago.", "Underlying EBITDA in constant currency was unchanged from a year ago. We had said -- since last year that we look at value creation from the MillerCoors and Miller global brand's transaction through the lens of the sum of three numbers: underlying after-tax earnings per share, transaction related cash tax benefit, and transaction related after-tax book amortization. In the first quarter, these three numbers were underlying after-tax earnings of $165.6 million, plus $97 million of transaction-related cash tax benefits, and $11.2 million of transaction-related after-tax book amortization.", "Also for those of you who want to calculate this measure on a per share basis, we had 216.5 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter.", "Total debt at the end of the first quarter was approximately $12.3 billion, while cash and cash equivalents totaled $395 million, resulting in net debt of $11.9 billion. Please see the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the first quarter.", "For the full year of 2017, we continue to expect cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million. Pension income of approximately $24 million, capital spending of approximately $750 million based on foreign exchange rates at the end of 2016, our consolidated net interest expense of approximately $370 million, plus or minus 5%, an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 24% to 28%, assuming no further changes in tax laws, settlement of tax audits, excess tax deduction or share-based compensations or adjustments to our uncertain tax provision.", "This range is consistent with our current expectation for our long-term tax rate. We expect our cash tax rate to be significantly lower in this range, due to the cash tax benefits related to MillerCoors transaction. U.S. legislative initiatives to reform U.S. tax laws could have a significant impact on our tax rate and our cash tax expectation.", "The post-transaction integration of our business and achievement of cost synergies are progressing well. And we continue to target more than $175 million of all-in cost savings in 2017, and $550 million of all-in savings by 2019. Related to this cost savings goal, we still anticipate incurring approximately $350 million of one-time incremental cash costs over three years to capture these synergies about evenly split between incremental capital spending and cash operating expense, primarily in the first two years of the program. ", "While we continue to expect our transaction-related cash tax benefits to average more than $275 million per year for the next 15 years, we now anticipate that these benefits will be front-end loaded in the first few years. With the latter years, slightly lower than the $275 million average. As Mark mentioned, we now expect these cash tax benefits to total nearly $390 million in 2017. This accelerated delivery is being driven by faster than anticipated tax depreciation of tangible assets related to the MillerCoors transaction.", "In addition, we now expect transaction-related amortization of approximately $45 million annually on an after-tax basis, up from $37 million previously, primarily due to the addition of the Miller global brand amortization. Also we now anticipate ending this year towards the top end of our 2017 underlying free cash flow guidance range, which is $1.1 billion, plus or minus 10%. We are generating cash ahead of our original expectations, primarily driven by the anticipated increase in cash tax benefit.", "Note that our 2017 free cash flow targets still exclude brand capital spending related to building our British Columbia brewery. We expect our 2017 underlying MD&A expense in corporate to be approximately $170 million, plus or minus 10%. This is higher than last year, primarily due to three main factors. First, investments to drive our global growth agenda around brands, analytics and digital. Second, investments to drive world-class performance across our global functions, including supply chain, information technology and shared services, which are key areas of synergy savings for our company. And thirdly, enhanced global capabilities, including some transfers from business units to corporate as we build out centers of excellence.", "As far as our cost outlook is concerned for the full year 2017, we continue to expect the cost of goods sold per hectoliter in MillerCoors to increase at a low single-digit rate, Canada COGS per hectoliter to increase at mid single-digit rate in local currency and our international business COGS per hectoliter to decrease at a double-digit rate.", "And we now expect our Europe COGS per hectoliter to increase at low single-digit rates in local currency, up from a low single-digit decrease previously due to changes in mix. In the context of exciting changes across all our businesses, my two main financial priorities for the balance of this year have not changed. First, deleveraging our balance sheet through cash flow generation, and second delivering on our cost savings commitments to provide fire power to our top-line and bottom line.", "At this point, I will turn it back over to Mark for outlook, wrap-up and Q&A. Mark?", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Tracey. In 2017, we will play to win via our First Choice consumer and customer agenda. So regionally looking forward, our U.S. goal of flat volume in 2018 and growth in 2019 has not changed, we will continue to invest in our flagship runs with Coors Light and Miller Lite plus Coors Banquet central to our investment focus.", "Miller Lite has begun rolling out new creatives as an extension of the successful Spelled Different, Brewed Different campaign. With the tagline Hold True, Miller Lite is defining how the beer has not compromised on taste and emphasizing the product credentials make it the original light beer. ", "We are also investing in Above-Premium and Redd's and Blue Moon Belgian White recently introduced new aluminum pint packaging. Leinenkugel's has introduced new packaging and its limited-edition lager, a collaboration with Germany's Hofbr\u00e4u M\u00fcnchen to celebrate the company's 150-year anniversary, and that will be available in six packs in June. And finally, the much-anticipated return of Zima will take place in time for the July Fourth holiday.", "And our First Choice for customer agenda, our fact-based Building with Beer tool is driving value for our retail customers in the on-premise and convenience channels, and we're expanding its reach in grocery and liquor this year. Tenth and Blake, the craft and import division of MillerCoors, will continue to focus on integrating and rapidly expanding the geographic reach of our craft acquisitions.", "Saint Archer, which had the fastest growth rate among the top 20 craft brewers selling in California, is expanding to Arizona, Oregon, Hawaii, Alaska and Washington. Hop Valley will extend its footprint this year to Nevada, Arizona, Colorado and Alaska. And Revolver, which is the number two regional craft brand in North Texas, is going to fill out its footprint across Texas in anticipation of neighboring state expansions in 2018. ", "Finally, Terrapin, the number 3 regional craft brewery in share growth and its outreach, recently expanded into Ohio, Kentucky and Mississippi, and we are considering additional opportunities for later this year.", "In Canada, we're seeing initial positive results from our First Choice agenda to bring momentum back to the top line, including a relentless focus on our two largest brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian. In the first quarter, we increased brand volume and market share nationally and in the West, partially due to the addition of the Miller brands. Looking forward, we're launching a new Molson Canadian campaign celebrating Canada's 150th Anniversary this year, and we're bringing this successful Climb On creative platform, nor for Coors Light. We're driving further growth in Above-Premium with our Coors Banquet, MGD, Mad Jack, Belgian Moon and the Heineken brand family.", "We also plan to leverage Miller Lite and Miller High Life to further strengthen our Canada portfolio. Customer relationships are beginning to drive trend improvements, and in the on-premise channel, our national key accounts volume and market share grew at mid-single-digit rates. We also increased distribution of key brands and packages across Canada and improved in-store execution of our brand campaigns across all channels. The construction of our new British Columbia brewery is progressing well, with the formal groundbreaking taking place last week at our new Chilliwack site.", "In Europe, we will continue to drive our First Choice consumer agenda for the existing portfolio and the addition of the Miller brands, and the royalty and export business in the region. We're also continuing to build our craft portfolio, including Sharp's, Franciscan Well, further expansion of Blue Moon in the region, and the purchase of a controlling interest in the La Sagra craft brewery near Madrid. As part of its expansion, Blue Moon has opened a new pub in Valencia in Spain, as a forerunner of many more to come in the years ahead. ", "In customer excellence, one of our largest wholesalers in the UK, Nisa, named Molson Coors Supplier of the Year for this year, including being recognized for best service, and availability for the second year running.", "Our international business is leveraging opportunities to grow the Coors and Miller brands in high opportunity markets, especially in Latin America and select countries in Asia and Africa. One action we are taking is to list and shift the original white can packaging for Miller Lite to all of its markets globally in the second half of the year. We plan to move away from most of the local transition sales and distribution agreements in the upcoming months and we'll utilize from partnering, export and local license agreements to expand the reach of our brands. ", "We anticipate these new business structures will require upfront investments to grow our brands which will impact international profit growth in the near to medium term. Additionally we expect that the termination of the Modelo contract in Japan at the end of June this year will hinder performance in this profitable market. We are exploring ways to mitigate the impact of the loss of this contract.", "So to summarize our discussion today, the first quarter underlying earnings were lower than last year primarily due to higher brand amortization expense, weaker January and February volumes in the U.S. because we were lapping tough earnings comparators from last year. Despite the softer start to the year, volume trends have improved recently. We are making great progress with our First Choice agenda in all of our businesses and we're confident of our full-year business plans. ", "Additionally, we are generating cash ahead of our original expectations. With the completion of the MillerCoors transaction late last year, and the changes we're making to align and enhance our organization, 2017 will be a transition year, as we build a larger, stronger company.", "Consistent with this, our results today reflect increased investments in the building blocks that will drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt paydown and total shareholder returns in the years ahead.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual our prepared remarks will be on the website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon, and also at 1 PM Eastern Time today, David Dunnewald will host a follow-up conference call, which is an opportunity for you to ask additional questions regarding our quarterly results. This call will also be available for you to hear via webcast on our website. ", "Additionally, in the next two months, we hope to see many of you at two events, firstly, we hold our Annual Meeting of stockholders on Wednesday May 17, 2017 in Montreal, and second, we'll host our Annual New York Investor and Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange on the afternoon of Wednesday June 7, again of this year.", "At this point, Denise, we'd like to open up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Vivien Azer from Cowen. ", "Vivien Azer ", "So, Mark, can I just follow-up on your commentary around the improvement that you've seen in the U.S. post soft January and February, can you quantify the rate of improvement?", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Vivien. I can't quantify the rate improvement, but I mean if you look at the scanner data, then we've certainly seen momentum improved through March and into April, a little bit interrupted by some of the horrific weather we saw in the U.S. over the course of the last week. But certainly feel good about the way momentum has built through March and again into April, and specifically in areas like our above premium portfolio, there is a lot of effort going into changing this trajectory on Redd's, and we're seeing that have a positive impact, the Blue Moon trajectory continues to be positive, alongside improvements that Gavin and his team have made on our below-premium portfolio, and the continuing share gains for our Premium Light, so -- but beyond that, I refer you really to the scanner data to check in for specifics.", "Vivien Azer ", "And just a follow-up to that. In terms of the net revenue per hectoliter in the U.S., would you be able to unpack that in terms of pricing versus the drag from negative mix? Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "So, Gavin, do you want to pick that up specifically and just talk to a bit more detail on our top-line performance?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sure, Mark. Good morning, Vivien. There are lot of factors that go into the makeup of our net sales, virtually the growth, Vivien, as you say, right, front line pricing, price motions and mix being the largest drivers. And if you stand back for a second there from a portfolio strategy point of view, just remember we play across the entire beer category, and you can break that down into the three segments of premium, above-premium and economy. And Mark touched on how we're doing with the various brands in his opening remarks, so I won't repeat that. ", "Our performance in the first quarter impacted mix, which was negative about 30 basis points. But let me just remind you that, we were going up against significant launch volumes for Henry's Hard Soda and we had a very strong mix performance in the first quarter of last year as a result of that loading. We're through that comparison now, Vivien, and Henry's Hard Soda velocities are increasing steadily as we head into the summer months. Our economy strategy is working and that's not necessarily positive from a mix point of view, but it's really important part of defending our share in economy to ensure that we don't become irrelevant in a very large segment and we also need to recruit new millennial drinkers into our portfolio in the beer category as a whole.", "Some of the other factors that make up price movement is, obviously frontline pricing, which in the first quarter was impacted negatively by the differential between sales to wholesales and sales to retail, which we've talked about on past calls. And just to remind you that our top line revenue is driven by sales to wholesalers, but our price promotions are driven by sales to retail, so that knocked a few points of our pricing in the quarter and that generally comes back over the full year.", "We had a little bit of noise from price promotions in the quarter, as distributors caught up with reconciliations and then obviously freight and fuel retail operations and timing of the federal excise tax to actually draw back, so also other elements that kind of drive overall NSR per hectoliter.", "And I guess my final comment on NSR, just to remind you, it's only one quarter, it's our smallest quarter. And so, some of the factors which I just described can have a little bit of a disproportionate impact. Pricing environment doesn't feel a whole lot different than it was last year. Hope that helps, Vivien.", "Mark Hunter", "Hey, Vivien, just to finish with a full stop [ph] on that, I mean, if you look at our pure net pricing, it was up about 0.5% in the quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. ", "Andrea Teixeira ", "Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit over Vivien's question. Are you implying that over the quarter you're having a little bit of de-stocking with the price increase or \u2013 and we should be seeing better sequential improvement into -- as you come out of the first quarter, just want to clarify how the trends are. And as I said, you're comping against a very tough innovation calendar. So is that something that again, you're going to be seeing as a more normalized impact, and if you can comment on how the trends are between sales to distributors and sales to retail as we speak? Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah, Andrea. Thank you. There was quite a few questions in your question there. So, if I start with your last point, which is around STWs and STRs, you got to remember that as we left 2016, demand generally across the beer industry in CPGs in the U.S. was really quite weak in December, which meant that we started 2017 with higher than anticipated stock within our wholesalers and that's why you're seeing a differential between STWs and STRs.", "If you just look at overall consumer demand though as we've come through the first quarter, it was sluggish to start the year. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that certainly improved as we exited February and come into March, and then further into April notwithstanding that, a little bit of whack we got last week, due to some of the weather across the U.S., but generally our STRs have improved consistently as we've come into March and April.", "With regard to the innovation agenda, I think Gavin mentioned the fact that we had a heavyweight innovation agenda in the first quarter of last year, with a lot of stock moving into the trade on the back of the Henry's Hard Soda launch. We've got further innovations coming into our business. Now we\u2019ve come into April, some of it new packs, and I also mentioned the fact that we're rolling Zima into our portfolio as well and that will come through in the second quarter. So I think to Gavin's point, now kind of [ph] balance itself out as we go through the year, so I wouldn't get too concerned on a one quarter basis, particularly as it's the smallest quarter of the year.", "Operator", "The next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs. ", "Judy Hong ", "So Mark, I mean I know this is a small quarter and there are a lot of moving parts here. But this is the first quarter since -- the first full quarter since the MillerCoors deal closed. I think the investors have been waiting to see the progress that you are making on cost saves and the margin progression and certainly we didn't see that in the quarter. So, what would you say to those people who are really concerned, that all of your cost savings are going to get competed away or eaten up by volume deleverage and really won't see the profit growth improving?", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks for the question, Judy. I mean let me give you a couple of headline perspectives here. So there is a lot of noise in the quarter. I think when you cut to the chase in the quarter if you come all the way down to EBITDA and constant currency were flat year-on-year, our free cash flow guidance has been enhanced. So as Tracey mentioned, we now anticipate being right at the top end of the guidance we gave you on the last call. And myself and the executive team remain confident on our full year plan. We have a lot of change taking place in our business and just from a context perspective, the volumes were softer in January and February in the U.S. We are lapping about 35% after-tax performance growth in first quarter of last year. And we're driving a lot of change across our business, but on the very positive side, we saw a strong worldwide brand volume growth. We saw global priority brand growth. We saw positive NSR per hectoliter improvements across all of our BUs. And my perspective is, we're making very, very good progress on the integration of our businesses both culturally and operationally.", "One of the things you have seen in the first quarter is that clearly we're investing in a couple of specific areas, which I think will stand the business in good stead, as we look out over the medium to long-term. One is the global commercial growth area, led by Kandy, which you're aware, I've put in place, and that now houses some of the significant investment that we'll be putting behind our global brand development as we look out through 2017 and beyond.", "And then secondly, we're further investing behind taking our world class supply chain capability to the next level and that's very important to really underpin in a sustaining way, the drive for productivity and efficiency in our business. So in the cost savings number that we've given you, the $550 million over three years, we had already accounted for what I described as dis-synergies associated with the global growth team and the world class supply chain investments with clearly the majority of the synergies pick up through 2018 and 2019.", "So, just remember the phasing associated with that so, we're investing ahead here to set the business up to build momentum, but actually, we're very good about both integration and the synergy planning and synergy delivery to date, as part of our overall cost savings. So I would just keep the context of this as one quarter, Judy.", "Judy Hong", "Just couple of follow-ups to that, so the increment \u2013 the investments that you are calling out, the couple of investments, are there any incremental in nature versus what you had thought to spend at the time of the closing of the deal or just really upfront investments and it's going to take some of the -- some time to get the synergies, so it's more of a timing issue.", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah, it's more of a latter, Judy. So there is nothing that's come as a surprise as we pulled our businesses together, we'd already anticipated and flagged the establishment of our global growth group and investment that would be required there, and taking more cost supply chain to the next level was again part of our thinking. The other thing that we have done as well, certainly from a corporate perspective, is we have moved some G&A from some of the businesses into corporate centers to really drive centers of excellence approach, so whether that's an HR, treasury, tax, really to drive much more of a one-way approach. And again, over the medium term to long-term that will give us enhanced productivity and efficiency in our business. So, we got to put that in upfront, then derive the benefits as we go through 2017 and then step change in 2018 and 2019.", "Judy Hong", "My last question, just the breakout of the Miller international brand contribution on volume, revenue and EBITDA, any color you can provide there? And why doesn't free cash be higher than even the high end of that $1.1 billion, just because now you're including the Miller brands internationally?", "Mark Hunter", "I'm not sure the Miller brand internationally can export free cash flow, but Tracey do you want to just talk to the free cash flow guidance?", "Tracey Joubert ", "Yeah, so it's just a couple of things Judy to consider as we look at our free cash flow forecast. So, we do have incremental CapEx and some of that is to deliver the synergies and cost savings. And we also have higher pension contributions, because we now have the 58% of MillerCoors contributions as well as we have incremental interest, because of the much higher stakes that we took on. So if you take those into account, they are sort of headwinds to our free cash flow", "David Dunnewald", "And Judy, sorry, this is Dave Dunnewald. I think your question on the free cash flow maybe now that we have more of the Miller global brands numbers flowing through why doesn't that have an effect on free cash flow? Actually we already had an estimate or we'd included Miller global brands in our guidance for free cash flow for 2017 when we gave it last quarter.", "Judy Hong", "Okay. And are you breaking out at all the volume and revenue or your EBITDA contribution or those trends?", "Mark Hunter", "No, we're not, Judy. I mean, that's not embedded in our businesses, and we'll report in aggregate both at segment level and then in relation to our total worldwide brand volumes, and our global priority brands.", "Operator", "The next question is from Laurent Grandet from Credit Suisse. ", "Laurent Grandet ", "I've got two quick questions. The first one is really a follow-up. So it's about deflation and shipments. So shipments declined by 4% in the quarter in the U.S. where deflation were down 2%. Now in Q4, deflation were down 2.8%, and shipments were only down 0.9%. So does it mean that we are now back to the right level of inventory with your distributors, and we should expect deflation and shipments to be more aligned going forward? So that's my first question.", "The second one is about the marketing spend. You increased by about $25 million in the quarter, your marketing, general and administration, especially outside of the U.S. So how should we think about A&M spend going forward and will you continue to add them as a similar percent of sales? And also I mean could you explain what brands are receiving most support and what are the marketing initiatives you implement? Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Laurent. Again it was a lot in there. So, I think on your first question to keep it simple and Gavin may want to add some color to this. Our philosophy in the U.S. is to ship to demand. The only addition to that is making sure there is enough stock to ensure that from a customer service or distributor service perspective that we ensure that we don't have any other stock situations, but there has been a philosophy, and Gavin I think it's fair to say we'll remain our philosophy.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yeah, Mark. You're quite right. I mean with this point in time, we do expect to ship more or less the consumption for the full year, but making sure that we do maintain service levels and our distributors did place increased orders at the backend of December, which did as you rightly point out increase our year-end distributor inventory by couple of days. And because of that, we didn't need to ship as much volume in the first couple of months of Q1, and that drove the difference which you highlighted. Our Q1 distributor inventory level at the end of the quarter, Laurent, was a little higher than last year's, we began our peak season inventory bode little earlier than normal to compensate for the Eden brewery closure, but as Mark says, our current expectation is to ship to consumption within the year.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Thanks, Gavin. And then Laurent, just to the second part of your question, when you look at the MG&A number, some of that is pure G&A relating to transfers of some people from the business units into corporate center or global roles. On the marketing side or the commercial side, one of the things I established when I came into the role and appointed, Kandy to lead this team as our global growth group, really focused on our commercial excellence agenda. So the investments, they are really going to cross five or six specific areas, building our insight capability, so we've just rolled up a global segmentation model to further direct how we build our portfolio, for global brand building. So there is a significant chunk of investment associated with the Miller trademark in making sure that we get that brand up and running positively.", "One of the examples of that I just pointed to is that, we're changing all of the packaging on Miller Lite aligned with the U.S. packaging that had not been done ahead of our acquisition, that's a big initiative and we'll roll across all the markets towards the end of this year. So the funding for that is an example centrally. The other three areas are really are on building our digital capability and B2B, B2C in particular and commerce. Disruptive innovation and we've now got a small team focused on innovation as part of that building our craft brands internationally and I mentioned in my opening remarks, that we've now our opened our first Blue Moon pub in Valencia, this is the first of what will be many.", "And then the final areas are under our customer excellence area focused on net promoter scores, category management and really driving stronger partnership, so that investment in the areas to support our intention and our capability right across our organization and it is more efficient for us to hold that potentially and to drive that kind of a cohesive approach. So, back to Judy's question, that's very much investing ahead of the curve to build the capability and performance of the business from medium to long-term.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. ", "Mark Swartzberg ", "A couple of U.S. questions, and sorry, good morning Tracey too. On the economy side, Gavin, you're seeing some nice improvement with Miller High Life, you mentioned Milwaukee's Best is not doing well. When you think about what's going right and what can\u2019t go right from a larger economy perspective, how are you thinking about that? And then my second question for either of you Mark or Gavin is, the reasons to believe, you're sitting here with the view that volume will -- you're aiming for volume to be flat in 2018 and grow after that in the U.S., and obviously it's a deliberately challenging objective. But when you think about what you're seeing in your business today, and what can happen in light of your plans whether for economy or other parts of your portfolio, what's at the top of your list of reasons to believe that that will happen?", "Mark Hunter", "So Gavin, do you want to pick-up the economy question first, and just bring Mark and everybody else on the call up to speed with progress.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yeah, sure, Mark. Good morning, thanks. Yeah. We've got several thrust on our economy strategy, Mark. Our overall objective from the beginning though was to hold that decline rate and get back more in line with where the economy industry portfolio share was going. And we've made really nice progress in the first quarter, which is really our first full quarter we're having the strategy in place.", "The start of the show at the moment quite frankly are Miller High Life and Keystone Life as Mark stated in his opening remarks, they both had excellent performances that they haven't had for seven and eight years. And Miller High Life has been centered around the campaign, if you've got the time, we've got the beers, focusing on the iconic glass bottle and the sort of heritage of this brand, which has been around since 1903. Keystone Light is focused on the new visual identity, which really modernized the brand and it's been well received by our customers and consumers. We've replaced the 12 pack with a 15 pack, which has driven a nice share gain for us and we are leveraging off the stone's nickname.", "We've also introduced Hamm's into the opening price point area. It's an area we didn't have a brand before and that brand has been around since 1865 and the early signs are encouraging. We've taken Mickey's back to the 40 ounce glass bottle. We've done and continued to accelerate Steel Reserve Alloy Series with a few additional flavors, which are doing nicely. And I'd say the area we need to do more work on is Milwaukee's Best. Not all of the changes we made to Milwaukee's Best have landed well with the consumers and we're of course correcting on that. So, I think as I evaluate how we are doing, we are off to a nice start and -- ", "Mark Swartzberg ", "And can you remind -- ", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sorry, Mark?", "Mark Swartzberg ", "No. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you, Gavin, Sorry.", "Gavin Hattersley", "I was just going to say I have confidence this strategy is going to work as the year progresses.", "Mark Swartzberg ", "And it sounds like it is. I guess, two quick follow-ups. Milwaukee's Best, getting that right. How impactful is that? Just to remind us where it is as a portion of your economy mix? And then can you remind us like what the rule of thumb is when you -- in terms of profitability of your economy portfolio either versus your regular portfolio or the entirety of your portfolio, just a comparative profitability at the contribution level?", "Gavin Hattersley", "So, I will answer the first question, which was Milwaukee's Best, I mean it is the third largest of our economy brand. So the largest are obviously Miller High Life and Keystone Light and those were the two that are really working very well. So it's the third largest market. In terms of overall profitability, I'm not sure we've ever shared that, and you know for competitive reasons, I don't think I'd like to do that now either.", "Mark Hunter", "And Mark, the fact that the other part of your original question, which was you described as reasons to believe, so I think you\u2019re quite right to say that, we have set [ph] stretching ambition in Gavin's call to action is very appropriate, because it changes the mindset in our organization. It's a mindset which is not about managing decline, but building for growth. I do want to reiterate though that it is not a volume at any cost aspiration, so we want to improve our volume trajectory, get back to flat and then growth and do that in the right way from our P&L perspective and continue to manage our investments through our pack lens, so that remains really business critical for us in the U.S.", "But I think the reasons to believe are when you really look across three big segments, the Below-Premium, Premium and Above-Premium, Gavin has explained what we're doing in Below-Premium and that was long overdue. It was a leaky bucket and we're making good progress, as steady as she goes in Premium Light and Coors Banquet and ideally we would have our two light brands in absolute volume growth territory. We touched that a couple of times, doing it consistently makes a big difference to our business.", "And then in our Above-Premium portfolio, if you think craft imports and FMBs, making really good progress on crafts and import and more work to do on FMBs particularly REDD's. And as I have mentioned, a lot of work has taken place through April, which is starting to have an impact on that brand, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to build out our Above-Premium portfolio. We talk in Molson Coors about buy, build and borrow across our portfolio. So, Gavin, myself and the exec team are looking at further opportunities to further enhance our Above-Premium portfolio for the medium to long-term.", "So, I think the important thing is, where our biggest volume areas are, we've made really good progress on the momentum building there. To use Gavin's language primarily, we still have some more work to do in Above Premium, particularly in FMBs, but we're all over that at the moment.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Andrew Holland from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. ", "Andrew Holland", "Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple, just no one mentioned your increase in your transaction tanks, up to $390 million and you've just said that's front-end loaded. Can you give us a bit of a clue as to whether it goes back down to $275 million next year or does it stay at this sort of level? And I'm just also wondering what you think is the reason why on a day when you increased your cash tax expectation so dramatically, even though, perhaps it's been a slow start to the year, your shares go down 4%. Can you give us any insight as to how you are looking at that transaction tax question, and whether there is any likelihood that you're going to include that in your sort of normal tax charge?", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah, so Tracey, do you want to take the first part of that question?", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. So, Andrew, what we did say is that our cash tax benefit would be around $275 million on average over 15 years. We did say that it would be frontend loaded. So, hence the nearly $390 million in 2017. We are not giving guidance as to the next few years, but to the asset part of that 15-year period, that cash tax benefit will fall below the $275 million. So, I can't give you more details than that other than saying it will be frontend loaded for the first few years and then below $275 million for the best part of the year. I'm not sure how to answer the share question. If I'm you I probably wouldn't be sitting here and give the market share performance. So, Mark, I don't know if you have any?", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah. I mean I struggle with the second part of your question, Andrew, I mean, what we can do is report transparently how our business is performing and give you a sense of confidence in how we see the business over the medium to long term. Investors will make up their mind on the basis of that information. I feel very good about the fact that we are guiding direct [ph] towards the top end of our free cash flow guidance. And we look to update on a quarterly basis if that changes again. So, beyond that, I can't really comment. You probably got hypothesis, which is just valid as mine or anybody else.", "Andrew Holland ", "Well, I'm puzzled as to why and when you're expecting 15 years. As I look at my model, I'm afraid it's not going out to year 15, but most investors are interested in the sort of shorter term, I would suggest, by which I mean perhaps the next three years. And that number is a very considerable swing factor in your likely reported earnings. And the reason I'm puzzled is that some of your competitors who have also had sort of time-delineated tax benefits have just taken that as part of the normal tax charge rather than as effectively and as exceptional item.", "Mark Hunter", "Let's ponder that perspective and feedback and then decide whether there is anything we would want to do differently. I really appreciate your perspective, Andrew.", "Andrew Holland", "Big swing in Europe, was that just the $50 million, was that just a Q1 effect, the release of that provision or is there more to come in future quarters?", "Mark Hunter", "So, Simon, do you want to just pick up at both that specific question, and maybe just give a little bit more color on our, let\u2019s call, our underlying performance in Europe?", "Simon Cox", "Yeah, Andrew, to answer you specific, if you remember, we made a provision in Q4 of last year based on what we concluded at that time was a range of loss that was deemed probable. We've subsequently been to court, and actually won on all counts and therefore, we've taken the decision to reverse that provision. So it was a provision we made last quarter, if you recall, and it's been reversed out this quarter. So, it's a straight in and out, if you like.", "In terms of the underlying performance in Europe, we were pretty happy with it. We've managed to grow volumes pretty significantly, and we've done that at the same time as growing our net sales revenue per hectoliter and I think any quarter where we can grow volumes and revenue per hectoliter in Europe, we will classify as a good one.", "Within the volumes, there is a mix of stuff that we've inherited from the Miller brand and from exports and license, but there's also strong encouraging underlying growth and particularly in the areas where we're making our marketing investments in Above Premium. So Staropramen has been performing well across the quarter; Coors Light continues to grow well, our craft portfolio the Sharp's, Franciscan Well and increasingly Blue Moon is doing well. So where we're putting our marketing investments and where we're focusing on our Premium and Above Premium portfolio it's working nicely and we're pleased with the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brett Cooper from Consumer Edge Research. ", "Brett Cooper", "Good morning, guys. A couple of questions from my side. I'm not sure if you're going to give an actual number, but I was wondering if you could either give us kind of a relative sense of the incremental investments you've made that are sort of embedded in your quarter relative to the savings you've delivered. I think the actual numbers are just sort of bigger than a breadbox, smaller than a car type thing. And then, I don't know if the broader question on revenue synergy that you're seeing from the deal or see possible from the deal and then particular interest in, I mean, is there a need to play in the price point between mainstream and where you typical crafts sells, given that two of probably the most successful brands in the U.S. kind of play in that price point? Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "So, Brett, just on the second part of your question, be more specific, because \u2013 ", "Brett Cooper ", "Sure. I mean, Especial and Mich Ultra sells over a 30% price premium to mainstream, right. You guys do obviously have a significant craft portfolio that sells at whatever 60% premium, you obviously have a significant mainstream, but there is nothing in that, call it that 25% to 30% price point.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. So, Tracey, do you want to give some thought to the first question just on how the incremental investment and savings weigh against each other, knowing that you won't give a number but give us some thoughts. And then just to your second part of your question, Brett. On revenue synergies, again, I'll come back to the language I used earlier. We think about how we look at building our portfolio from a buy, build and borrow perspective. So buy, are there opportunities like we've done with our craft acquisitions in the U.S. or with Sharp's, as an example, build is create something from scratch. The Redd\u2019s was created from scratch a few years ago as was Henry's. Our borrow means moving brands from one market to another, so I think we're confident that we have now identified a number of opportunities where we can actually start to shift some brands from one market to another and Miller High Life is a good example in terms of the transfer between the U.S. and Canada and that's something that's very much work in progress. Now there are others as well, but I'm not going to talk to them specifically, because I think it's competitively sensitive.", "With regard to the GAAP in our portfolio that you described, again I'd come back to my earlier comments, which is Gavin and the executive team are actively working on a range of options across buy, build and borrow further enhances our Above Premium portfolio in the U.S. and we'll talk to those in due course. So they\u2019re central to our thinking, we are working through a range of options and we'll update when we've got firm news that we can share. Tracey, do you want to talk to the first part of the question?", "Tracey Joubert", "Yeah. So, Brett, I'm not going to give you specific numbers, but maybe just a little bit of context. So in terms of cost savings, what we have said is we're going to be targeting to deliver more than $175 million of cost savings in 2017. In terms of incremental investments, I mean it's all according to plan. Our brand investments have increased across all of the BUs except for MillerCoors in the first quarter and Gavin just touched on effect that we had the Henry's launch last quarter, which was quite a significant launch. So and brand investments increased across all BUs. Our G&A was on plan and we did mention that there is some incremental investments that we are building in the corporate center around our customer excellence, around supply chain, as well as moving some cost to the center to provide global value-added services such as our global business services and some IT. But you know more than that, we're not going to give numbers.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Pablo Zuanic from SIG. ", "Pablo Zuanic", "I have two questions, but I guess, Mark, given that you asked why you're -- I will take the liberty to answer if you don't mind. You have promised $550 million of cost savings over three years. You have not told us how much of that is going to flow to the bottom line, so we're all left to make assumptions. But we assume 30% can flow, 50%, 70%. But this is a quarter where your EBITDA in the U.S. was down $54 million. And I work out that your savings quarterly should be about $30 million. So savings are supposed to be $33 million at MillerCoors per quarter. There is no seasonality in cost savings I suppose. And your EBITDA is down $54 million. So that's why the stock is down 5%.", "Now I have two questions, okay. One, maybe I'm overly simplistic in my analyses but to be honest, when it comes down to Molson Coors as a stock, right, obviously, I don't look at what happens in London or Croatia. I look at two metrics. I look at your STRs in the U.S. and I look at your EBITDA in the U.S. I mean EBIT this quarter was distorted because of your increased brand amortization as you explained and bill-related amortization, so I can't look at EBIT. On STR front, your STRs being down 2% this quarter. It's actually great news. The comps get easier and everything you've told us toady makes us believe that numbers will improve. If it was just based on STRs, your stock would be up 5% today.", "So the question I have for Gavin and then I'll move back to my EBITDA question is that typically for all the brewers whether it's [indiscernible] Constellation Brands, yourself, Anheuser-Busch, STRs are normally below the scanner data, and you've been 1 points to 2 points worse, and that's normally because liquor stores, bars and restaurants are doing worse than the mass major channel. But this quarter your STRs has actually been down 2% surprised me when this kind of data was telling me for the quarter down about 4%. So my question, Gavin, and you've talked already about the value brands and the number of initiatives you've said, can you give me any explanation or any color in terms of what's happening in liquor stores, bars and restaurants and major channels for MillerCoors that will explain why your STR is only down 2% in the quarter where this kind of data would imply something much worse. And I have a follow-up on the EBITDA question, but if you can answer that first, please? Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Thanks, Pablo. Thanks for the setup as well. So Gavin, do you want to talk about perspective on STR specifically?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yeah, sure. Pablo, good morning. Look I mean, I'm not going to get into all the mechanics of why sometimes STRs don't match up with Nielsen or IRR, but what I can tell you is that, actually the on-premise volume trend in the first quarter was better. And that obviously is a little different to where it has been over the last four quarters at least of 2016. So that would be one of the drivers that would be causing you to have perhaps over estimated decline in our STRs. Our estimates are that we are closing the gap with the sort of industry trends on-premise. I would attribute some of that to our very successful Building With Beer Program on the on-premise which really is a fact based tool as Mark said in his opening remarks, that help our sales folk and our distributors sell to onpremise retail customers. So, that's probably the best answer I can give you for explaining some of that difference.", "Pablo Zuanic", "That's very helpful. So, Mark, then the second question is on the EBITDA front. Yeah can I?", "Mark Hunter", "Just before you enter the question, you mentioned a number on MillerCoors EBITDA and I don't recognize the number. So if you want to just kind of reiterate that and I hope I can clarify.", "Pablo Zuanic", "Right. Okay. Unless I'm looking at the wrong number, I thought the EBITDA -- for underlying EBITDA for MillerCoors was $442 million. And this quarter and in the quarter last year, the pro forma EBITDA number was -- sorry, the EBITDA, yeah and I'm looking at -- it was $323 million, right, and last year it was about $345 million, right, that's the MillerCoors EBITDA number, correct?", "Mark Hunter", "No. So the EBITDA number there...", "Pablo Zuanic", "No, I'm sorry, I'm looking at the pre-tax, I'm sorry, I want to repeat. I'm sorry, is what I said at the beginning, the EBITDA, the underlying EBITDA for MillerCoors for the quarter was $442 million and in the quarter last year was $459 million, correct?", "Mark Hunter", "Yeah. So it's down about 3.7%. And last year had grown by almost 18%. So, we're cycling what was an 18% increase in EBITDA in 2016. So I would describe as becoming a bit more normalized to use that language in 2017.", "Pablo Zuanic", "So a follow-up. So it's about an $18 million and $20 million decline. So, the question is very simple. I'm just trying to understand whether there is any one-offs or factors that would explain why there was an EBITDA growth in the quarter when you are supposed to have these cost savings coming through. I mean, obviously your shipments were down 4%, so that explains part of the fact, the issue. Your pricing apparently was not enough to cover the higher costs, right. So, the question, I guess, I can just boil it down to very simple. Cost savings $175 million for the year. I calculate $130 million for MillerCoors. That's about $33 million per quarter. Was there anything in the first quarter that will make us think that there wasn't a lot of cost savings realized yet at MillerCoors in the first quarter and that we should see more of that as the year progresses ? Maybe Tracey, you can answer that.", "And the last question, and it's related to the same subject, it's more at the corporate level. Again, if I'm looking at the right numbers, if I look at your EBITDA by division including corporate, corporate EBITDA went from minus $25 million in the first quarter last year to almost minus $50 million this year, still increased, although we are supposed to be in a cost savings program here? So those are my two questions, Tracey, if you can answer? Thank you.", "Tracey Joubert", "So, just in terms of MillerCoors and I'll ask Gavin to jump in. But the MillerCoors did deliver cost savings and we are not going to detail it by BU but they did generate fairly significant cost savings, but the biggest driver on the EBITDA was the volume, so no specific one-off, but the volume did account for all of the sort of negative drivers.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yeah. I think, I mean, the only other thing to add would be if you look at our COGS performance in the U.S. in Q1 of last year, our COGS were down about 5%, our COGS this year in the U.S. increased by 1.7%, so there was a number of very positive tailwinds we had in the first quarter of 2016, some of which are not repeated in 2017. So probably some more of that detail would be worth taking up on the follow-up call today, probably. And then, your question on corporate, I mean, I think I've dealt with that which is that some of that relates to us investing ahead of the curve in commercial and supply chain and also transferring some cost of the business season to the center, so we can drive a more of a consistent approach and drive efficiency and productivity over time. So I think you should start to see that kind of stabilize and get comfortable with as we go through the year. Obviously, we've had to kick things off and invest ahead of the curve as we establish our new organization.", "Pablo Zuanic", "That's very helpful. And if I may, just one last one for Gavin. So you\u2019ve talked about a number of metrics in the U.S. business in terms of volumes. Can you just talk about the Light, what you call the Premium Light beer segment, Coors Light, Miller Lite, Bud Light, as a segment, is that beginning to stabilize now that space for craft is not being expanded at retail and that bars and restaurants, does that help Light in any way? Does it help it stabilize? What are you seeing there at the category level? I realize that you're gaining share in that segment specifically. Thanks.", "That's all.", "Gavin Hattersley", "From an overall category point of view, Pablo not much change. Where the change has come is obviously with our share within Premium Light, which has grown for the last 25 straight months and so that's a fairly prolonged period of share growth. So I'm pleased with the performance of both the Coors Light and Miller Lite. It's not driven by pricing tactic, it's in our view driven by the superior product and the marketing campaign, so they are really resonating with the consumers. I think overall though, to cut to the chase of your question, Premium Lights are still declining in total volume, and fairly consistently.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.", "Bryan Spillane", "So just one question from me, and I guess, probably it may tie back to a little bit of how you just answered the previous question. But I think, one of the questions, we've fielded this morning a few times is just if you take out the net effect of the gain, that the tax reversal in the UK netted against the bad debt provision, if you stripped that out of the EBITDA, you're at like, EBITDA down like 12% on an underlying basis in the first quarter. And, I guess, it's got people kind of confused with, if anything you've kind of raised the free cash flow guidance, understanding that some of that is coming from the change in the tax piece. But, I think, people are trying to reconcile how EBITDA could be down that much, and yet there is no change to the rest of the year. And so, I guess the question is just, are there some other things that you compare to the rest of the year, where EBITDA should be better year-over-year than what we saw in the first quarter? If you could just kind of reconcile those, I think that would be helpful?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sure. I mean, I think, it's going to play into some of the comments already made, Bryan. The first quarter is a small quarter. We're investing ahead of the curve in two or three areas, which I have already mentioned to you. There were a couple of headwinds as well for example about debt provision that we flagged as well. So I think, some of it is timing, some of it's the fact that this is a small quarter, some of it's the fact that we're getting the business ready for delivering on the growth agenda, and our First Choice agenda.", "I remain confident in our business plans on a full year basis. So, there is certainly some noise from, I would describe as a phasing and a timing perspective and we're lapping a very significant, very successful launch in the U.S. last year as well with Henry's as we have talked to. We've got the Canada amortization as well which flows through as a headwind on the business. So, there is a few puts and takes, but the important thing is, when you start right at the top of our P&L and we've seen strong global brand volume growth, we've seen our global priority brands grow and we've seen our NSR per hectoliter grow as well across all of our business units, even when you net out the benefit associated with the release of the provision, you still have NSR per hectoliter growth in each of the BUs. So, I always feel good if the top of the P&L is in the right shape, because then everything below that's a decision for management to make. So, I remain confident about the position of our business and our outlook relative to our plans for this year.", "Bryan Spillane ", "Thanks for that. And I guess, I just wanted to make sure I was interpreting it correctly, but what I sort of interpreted today was that, if you look at the top-line with the exception of the U.S. being soft in January and February which was unexpected, it sounds like, generally, the rest has been in line or even better than maybe what your expectations were going into the quarter, is that fair?", "Mark Hunter", "I would say, more in line with expectations, I mean it's great to be able to reference the fact that we've seen our top-line in Canada and our volume and our market share grow. As Simon pointed out, we've seen strong volume growth on NSR per hectoliter growth in Europe. Our international business took a big step forward in the first quarter. But clearly as we go through the year, there'll be some more volatilities [indiscernible] some of the TSAs, et cetera, but that's very encouraging and in the U.S., as I think we've tried to identify January and February were slower than anticipated trends through March and most of April have come back much more positively. So, if you look at the fundamentals of our business, if you look at the commitment we've made on a three-year basis on cost savings and flexibility that that gives us, then I don't think anything material has changed from where we were as we left 2016 and how we started 2017.", "Operator", "Yes, sir, I have Robert Ottenstein from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Robert Ottenstein", "I am trying to get at some of the questions, we've been asking it maybe a different way. You've mentioned I believe that you're going to have $175 million of costs that will run through the P&L this year to take out the synergies. Can you tell us how much of that $175 million went through the P&L this quarter?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes. So just to be clear, Robert, what we said is the cost to get the synergies, we said that's about $350 million over three years, about half of that is OpEx and half of that is CapEx, but that's over three years. We've never said that that was a one year number in 2017.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Well, can you tell us how much was spent in the quarter to achieve the synergies?", "Mark Hunter", "No. It's not a detail we go into, I mean I think we've given you the guidance on $550 million of combined savings, about $350 million incremental to get those and sustain them split 50:50 between CapEx and OpEx. And as we've mentioned pretty consistently the synergies tend to ramp up and accelerate as we get into 2018 and 2019. So Tracey, I don't know whether you would add some color.", "Tracey Joubert", "Robert, I'm not sure if you're confusing the cost savings synergies that we've given guidance for this year at $175 million. So, we expect to deliver $175 million of cost savings in 2017, not spending.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Okay. What I'm trying to find out is how much you spent in the quarter to achieve the synergies. And I think Mark said that you're not going to disclose that number?", "Tracey Joubert", "No.", "Mark Hunter", "We understand the question, but Dave?", "David Dunnewald", "Yeah, Robert, we're not going to disclose the specific number, buy you can look at page 10 of the earnings release and see a line in there that gives you acquisition and integration related costs that have been excluded from our underlying results. And that would be a part of the cost achieved synergies, call it operating expense if you like, it does not tell you what the CapEx, and it also doesn't tell you about some of the other areas where we're enhancing in our business that Mark talked about earlier, where we're spending there as well. ", "Robert Ottenstein", "So you've got that one bucket of costs that are highlighted on page 10, and then you've also mentioned this other bucket of costs in which you're investing ahead of the curve, can you tell us what that number is for either the quarter or the year?", "Mark Hunter", "No, the $550 million number we've given, Robert, over the three years is net of the, let's call it, the dis-synergies, but we haven't broken either by line item or by timing. So the $550 million number is net of that. What you've got the difference in phasing, so I'll make it real for you, Kandy and his team are now in place and they're working on lots of initiatives, one of which I mentioned earlier, which is the rollout of Miller Lite packaging globally later this year. So that\u2019s -- and it's real and it's happening now. Some of the synergies which then start to offset the dis-synergy flow through towards the end of 2017 and then really ramp up in 2018 and 2019. So you've just got a difference in timing and phasing of these things, that are either feathered into the business or the cost is removed from the business. In a perfect world, it would all start on day one and it would flow seamlessly in a complementary nature, it doesn't operate like that, which is why \u2013 ", "Robert Ottenstein", "No, I appreciate that. So, key takeaway, the gross cost take-out is well over $550 million, the $550 million is a net number?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, that's correct.", "Robert Ottenstein", "And in terms of this investing ahead of the curve, so to speak, how much of that are things that are going to be people costs, that are going to be a permanent part of the cost base and how much is more one-time items like the cost to switch the packaging, is there any way to kind of give us a sense of that?", "Mark Hunter", "Well, I mean, I can't get into that level of detail. Clearly, things that are one-off are going below the line from a U.S. GAAP perspective and we've identified those on our release. There are some things like our world-class supply chain capability, some of our centers of excellence, our global growth team which are here to sustain our business over the medium to long-term, so they will be embedded in our business going forward. Because it makes sense as we build our business, but the synergy and cost saving number we've given you is net of those incremental costs.", "Robert Ottenstein", "And then finally, I understand you're not giving us the investment cost for the year, and you're not giving us the cost to achieve the synergies for the year. But, I mean, has most of it been incurred this quarter, what's the kind of general cadence you expect for those investment items or cost items throughout the rest of the year?", "Mark Hunter", "Again, Robert, I mean, you're trying to push me again to specifics not quarter-by-quarter basis, I'm just not going to go there, because this is quite volatile depending on the nature of the initiatives and, if I start doing now, it becomes very difficult from a comps perspective. I think you want to look at the $550 million over the three years, look at the $350 million spread across OpEx and CapEx, form an opinion as to what that should look like from a phasing perspective and I really don't want to get below that level of detail.", "End of Q&A", "Operator", "And this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Thanks, Denise, and just for me many thanks for your time and interest in the Molson Coors Brewing Company.

Before we begin, I will paraphrase the company's Safe Harbor language. Some of the discussion today may include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from what the company projects today. So, please refer to its most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings for a more complete description of factors that could affect these projections.", "The company does not undertake to publicly update forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they were made.", "Regarding any non-U.S. GAAP measures that maybe discussed during the call and from time-to-time by the company's executives discussing the company's performance, please visit the company's website, www.molsoncoors.com, and click on the Financial Reporting tab of the Investor Relations page for a reconciliation of these measures to the nearest U.S. GAAP results.", "Also unless otherwise indicated, all financial results the company discusses are versus the comparable prior-year period and in U.S. dollars and the consolidated and U.S. segment results are presented versus pro forma results a year ago, which reflects the acquisition of MillerCoors as if it and the related financing had occurred on January 1, 2016.", "Following the prepared remarks this morning, management will take your questions. In order to allow as many people to ask questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. If you have multiple questions, please ask your most important question first and then return to the queue to ask additional ones.", "Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors. Please go ahead.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thank you, Rachel, and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call and many thanks for joining us today. With me in the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the CEO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Stewart Glendinning, our International CEO; Sam Walker, our Global Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, our Global VP of Investor Relations.", "Today, Tracey and I will take you through the highlights of our third quarter and year-to-date results, along with some perspective regarding the balance of 2017. Consistent with last quarter, we're also offering slides that show both reported and constant-currency results for both the quarter and year-to-date. You can view and follow along with these slides using the link on the Investor Relations page of our website.", "The Molson Coors Brewing Company will deliver growth and long-term shareholder value through our first choice for consumer and customer approach, an expanded international business, the delivery of integration savings, ongoing cost savings, a more efficient global organization and a relentless drive for financial performance.", "Our focus is to deliver both top and bottom line growth. Year-to-date, we've delivered worldwide brand volume growth, driven by our global priority brands. And on a constant-currency basis, NSR per hectoliter is up 2.4% as our portfolio premiumization has driven pricing and mix benefits around the globe.", "To this point, in terms of progress, above-premium brand volumes increased 19% in the quarter and 20% for the year. And with this strong growth, our above-premium brands now represent 18% of our total volumes. At the same time, we've improved our EBITDA margins this year while investing in the business, with underlying EBITDA margins up by nearly 40 basis points year-to-date.", "Our 2017 underlying free cash flow generation has been strong. We begun delevering our balance sheet and we're generating cost savings ahead of our plan, which has helped to mitigate higher-than-anticipated input cost inflation.", "Now, a question I get when I talk with investors is, how we prioritize our top and bottom line goals? And the management team and our board address this important point as follows. We, first, will drive margin expansion and bottom line growth by delivering cost savings, ensuring efficient brand investments and paying down debt. Second, we will drive an improved top line through our commercial excellence approach, which provides a more sustainable source of profit growth over the medium to long term. This is our order of priority. Additionally, we will maintain our profit focus and our continued drive for total shareholder return through PACC or profit after capital charge, which is our capital allocation tool.", "So, one year on from the close of the MillerCoors transaction, the bigger, better and stronger Molson Coors is driving a cohesive and distinctive First Choice commercial agenda, an expanded international business, a more efficient global organization and a relentless focus on financial performance, all underpinned by highly engaged employees who are playing to win.", "And with that as a backdrop, I'll now turn over to Tracey to give financial highlights.", "Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everybody. So, let's review our consolidated financial headlines for the third quarter versus our pro forma results a year ago, except for cash flow, which is reported on a year-to-date actual basis.", "Our net sales decreased 2.1% due to lower financial volumes, partially offset by positive global pricing, sales mix, royalty volume and foreign currency movements. Our net sales in constant currency declined 3%. Our global net sales per hectoliter increased 2.9% and 1.9% in constant currency, due to higher global pricing and sales mix.", "Our worldwide total brand volume increased 0.6%, driven by strong growth in Europe and International, partially as a result of adding the Miller global brands business and also from growth in some of our core brands. Our global priority brand volume increased 2.4%.", "Our financial volume decreased 4.8%, driven by the U.S. and Canada, which were adversely impacted by reductions in wholesaler inventories, contract brewing and brand volumes. These volume declines were partially offset by growth in both Europe and International due to added Miller International brand volumes as well as positive organic brand performance.", "U.S. net income increased (sic) [decreased] 12.1% and underlying non-GAAP net income decreased 3.5%. Our underlying results were primarily attributable to lower financial volume, higher brand amortization expense, increased G&A costs and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by positive pricing and mix, cost savings and lower interest expense.", "Our underlying EBITDA decreased 1.2% on a constant-currency basis. Our underlying free cash flow compared to actual results last year increased nearly 80%, driven by the addition of the other 58% of MillerCoors cash flows as well as lower cash tax paid for taxes, which were partially offset by higher cash paid for interest and capital expenditures.", "We ended the quarter with net debt of $11.3 billion and we made an additional discretionary contribution of $200 million to our U.S. defined-benefit pension plan in the third quarter as part of our deleveraging goals, bringing our total cash contributions to approximately $310 million for the year. We remain committed to investment-grade debt ratings and reducing our leverage ratio to about 4 times on a rating-agency basis by the end of 2018.", "Year-to-date, we improved underlying EBITDA by 1.8% in constant currency, with strong NSR per hectoliter growth and total worldwide brand volume up 1.6%.", "And now, I'd like to share some regional highlights from the third quarter. In the U.S., we grew underlying EBITDA 0.8% on a pro forma basis in the quarter, resulting from increased domestic NSR per hectoliter, driven by higher net pricing as well as cost savings and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by the impact of lower shipment volumes.", "Overall, U.S. STRs declined 2.9% for the quarter on a trading-day-adjusted basis, in part because the U.S. volume environment remains challenging. Our domestic sales to wholesalers declined 7.2%, with nearly two-thirds of the gap between STRs and STWs driven by a reduction in distributor inventories and the rest due to one less trading day this quarter. Distributor inventories were reduced in the third quarter following higher-than-planned levels at the end of the second quarter.", "Our year-to-date U.S. performance was similar to the third quarter, with a 2.2% increase in underlying EBITDA, 0.8% higher NSR per hectoliter and a 2.3% decline in STR volume. Despite the difficult backdrop, we made progress this quarter against our portfolio strategy, as Mark will share with you shortly.", "Our Canada underlying EBITDA declined 0.5% in the quarter, driven by the impact of lower domestic volume, partially offset by positive pricing and foreign currency impact. On a constant-currency basis, underlying EBITDA declined 5.7% during the quarter. We drove strong NSR per hectoliter growth with a combination of price and mix benefits, but industry volume trends remained difficult, declining approximately 2%. Our market share grew slightly, driven by the return of the Miller brands, along with the strong above-premium growth from Coors Banquet and Belgian Moon.", "Our third quarter Canada performance represents a trend improvement compared to earlier in the year, as year-to-date underlying EBITDA declined 10.7% in constant currency. Year-to-date NSR per hectoliter grew 2.6% in local currency, reflecting positive net pricing and mix.", "Europe continued to produce strong results this quarter, with underlying EBITDA up 13.6%, driven by higher volume, positive sales mix and pricing, increased net pension benefit and favorable foreign currency. Constant currency EBITDA increased 10.4% in the quarter.", "Brand volume increased 9.6% in the quarter, primarily due to the addition of the Miller brands and the transfer of royalty and export brand volumes across Europe from our International business. Even without this incremental volume, we continue to achieve growth from our offering of core and above-premium brands, which helped drive net sales per hectoliter growth during the quarter.", "Our year-to-date underlying EBITDA, NSR per hectoliter and brand volumes in Europe grew strongly.", "Underlying EBITDA for our International business was a loss of $1 million in the quarter, which represents an improvement from a year ago. Although the impact of hurricanes presented a significant challenge in several of our high-margin Caribbean markets, Coors Light continued to drive strong volume growth across Latin America and we have moved off the Miller transition service agreements and established platforms for growth with local partners.", "Our brand volume increased 64.7% in the quarter and our third quarter net sales nearly doubled, driven by this higher volume, along with positive pricing, while reported net sales per hectoliter declined about 11.6% due to sales mix changes.", "Our year-to-date underlying EBITDA for International improved from a loss of $4.9 million last year to income of $3.1 million this year, with brand volumes up 56.3% and reported NSR per hectoliter down 1.3%. Please see our earnings release for a detailed review of our business unit financial results in the third quarter as well as our latest outlook and guidance targets.", "Now, this quarter, we have the following updates regarding our guidance metrics. For the medium term, we continue to expect underlying EBITDA margins to increase an annual average of 30 to 60 basis points over the next three, four years. For 2017, we anticipate margins being in this range. Also, it is important to remember the cash tax benefits associated with the MillerCoors transaction, which were $109 million this quarter and are expected to be more than $400 million for full year of 2017.", "We now anticipate total capital spending of approximately $650 million, plus or minus 5%, which is updated from $750 million, plus or minus 10%. Our underlying corporate net interest expense of approximately $360 million, plus or minus 5%, is updated from consolidated net interest of $370 million, plus or minus 10%. We have tightened our underlying effective tax rate range to 26% to 28% from 24% to 28% previously. We now expect our cost of goods sold per hectoliter for the International business to increase at a low-single-digit rate versus a mid-single-digit rate decrease previously stated.", "We have raised our outlook for pension income to approximately $27 million, up from $24 million.", "And although we are not changing our 2017 cost savings guidance of more than $175 million, we are pleased that these savings are coming in ahead of our original plans, because it is helping to cover inflation, particularly related to aluminum, which is higher than our expectations from earlier this year.", "And at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Tracey. I began this call by outlining our plans to drive total shareholder returns. And while the business environment, especially in North America, remains more challenging than anticipated, we believe our ambition to be first choice for consumers and customers will generate sustainable returns to our shareholders.", "Our regional business priorities are clear and consistent. In the U.S., we remain focused on gaining segment share in premium, growth in above-premium and stabilizing our below-premium brand share. As you can see in this slide, this drives our consumer excellence approach and let me give you some proof points on our progress.", "In premium, Miller Lite is well on track to become the number three beer brand in America. Strong momentum for Coors Banquet continues, as we expect 2017 to mark the 11th consecutive year of annual growth for this iconic American brand.", "In 2018, Coors Light will relentlessly sharpen and strengthen its message as the World's Most Refreshing Beer, including some exciting packaging changes. Both Miller Lite and Coors Light are powerhouse brands. They gained segment share again this quarter, a trend that's extended for more than 21/2 years.", "In above-premium, Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy had a record-breaking year with volumes up low-double digits. We plan to build on this success next year through a number of packaging and Shandy innovations. Meanwhile, the Blue Moon family is widening its lead as the world's number one craft brand and Blue Moon Belgian White will continue its growth momentum with new SKUs and a focus on our legendary on-premise orange ritual, which is driving strong velocity and incremental tap handles across the U.S.A.", "As per Nielsen, Blue Moon and Leinie's families accounted for 22% of the total craft beer volume growth year-to-date in the U.S. In regional craft, Terrapin, Hop Valley, Revolver, Colorado Native and Saint Archer are all growing at strong double-digit rates, well ahead of the overall craft segment, as we continue to integrate and expand geographically. And Peroni is growing and accelerating this year as we have enhanced the geographic reach of this aspirational import brand through improved market prioritization.", "In below-premium, our new packaging types, price points and commercial focus are delivering a significant trend improvement in this segment, as per our strategy. We're also very excited about our brand additions in the U.S. As of October 1, we assumed the rights to import, market and distribute Sol, which further strengthens our above-premium portfolio.", "And over the next few months, we'll bring to retail new high-potential brands with Arnold Palmer Spiked, designed to take share in the valuable alcoholic tea segment, and Two Hats, which is positioned to recruit new legal-drinking-age consumers into beer.", "We're confident we have the right plans to achieve growth and we will continue to execute with relentless focus while looking for further build, borrow and buy opportunities for additional above-premium scale. Our customers tell us that our First Choice approach to sales and supply chain execution is working, with 14 supplier awards so far in 2017. We also continue to roll out our Building with Beer tool to new channels and customers. And these are the building blocks for long-term profitable growth for our U.S. business unit.", "In Canada, our consumer excellence teams will remain focused on gaining segment share in premium, accelerating our growth in above-premium and stabilizing our below-premium brand share. Improving the performance of our two biggest brands, Coors Light and Molson Canadian remains the number one priority and we're currently executing upweighted volume-driving activities with consumers.", "Our above-premium performance, led by Coors Banquet, MGD, Belgian Moon and the Heineken portfolio, is accelerating with exciting further lift and shift brand additions planned in 2018 and we are executing a plan to simplify our below-premium portfolio with the launch of Miller High Life from late in the fourth quarter.", "Since the introduction of Coors Banquet just a few years ago, exceptional consumer demand has propelled this brand at double-digit growth rates to become the most successful new product introduction in the past five years in Canada. Our performance across the portfolio will also be driven by customer excellence, as we lift and shift best practice sales tools from other regions. As an example, we've started to see improved volume performance from the early retail adopters of the Building with Beer program.", "Our supply chain team continues to prioritize efforts on building and planning for the new British Columbia and Greater Montreal breweries. This work will create efficiency and flexibility in our supply chain, which we expect to unlock material savings in the medium to long term.", "In Europe, consumer and customer excellence is driving the top and bottom line. We'll continue to drive a balanced portfolio approach as we strengthen our national mainstream brands and continue to premiumize by driving our craft portfolio, Staropramen, Coors Light and cider brands, along with the addition of the Miller brands and the royalty and export business in the region.", "In July, we completed the purchase of Birradamare, a small Italian craft brewery, which provides us another opportunity in Italy and select export markets to build on our strong above-premium performance.", "So far this year, our balanced portfolio approach across Europe resulted in maintaining our share-of-segment in our mainstream brands as well as generating double-digit growth in above-premium. One driver of successful portfolio premiumization in the quarter and the last few years is Coors Light's ongoing focus on ice cold Rocky Mountain refreshment, which is resonating powerfully with consumers, and Coors Light has grown to become our second-largest brand in the UK.", "Above-premium Staropramen, outside of the Czech Republic, has also grown at strong double-digit rates across Europe, such that the total Staropramen family now exceeds 2.5 million hectoliters of annual volume in the region.", "Furthermore, in what remains a fiercely competitive environment in the UK, our First Choice customer approach earned us the number one ranking in the Advantage Survey of multiple grocers for the second consecutive year.", "Our International business will continue to leverage our strong global brands, partnerships and commercial capabilities around the world and focus our brands on the most attractive segments to grow Coors Light, the Miller brands and Blue Moon. Our customer teams have successfully rolled out a common segmentation analysis in all of our markets, Coors Light is growing at strong double-digit rates in Latin America and within a year of acquiring the Miller brands, we are currently launching the original white can packaging for Miller Lite to more than 20 markets globally.", "The scaled-up International business requires upfront investments to grow our brands and as indicated earlier this year, our MG&A will be higher this year, funded by a step change in gross profit, as we lay the foundations for accelerating top and bottom line growth from 2018 onwards.", "We expect our gross profit to be at the lower-end of the 2017 guidance range of $90 million, plus or minus 10%, principally due to the impact of the hurricanes in the Caribbean. We expect this impact of approximately $3 million to $5 million to flow through to the bottom line this year as we continue to invest in our brands. Clearly for 2018, we have plans to offset these negative impacts and continue to drive top line growth and improved profit performance from our International business.", "So, in reviewing our performance in the third quarter as well as year-to-date, we're building traction against our strategic priorities, as indicated by delivering growth in global brand volume, net sales per hectoliter and underlying EBITDA margin.", "In the fourth quarter this year, we anticipate less significant distributor inventory dynamics in the U.S. than we saw in the third quarter, along with a favorable comparison in Europe as we cycle a $50 million indirect tax provision in the fourth quarter of last year.", "Despite challenging market conditions in North America, we remain on track to deliver our 2017 business and financial plans, exceed our original cost savings targets and cash flow goals as well as maintaining our investment-grade debt ratings.", "One year on from the close of the MillerCoors transaction, the bigger, better and stronger Molson Coors is driving a cohesive First Choice commercial agenda, an expanded international business, a more efficient global organization and a relentless focus in financial performance, all underpinned by highly engaged employees who are playing to win.", "Now, before we start the Q&A portion of the call, just a quick comment. As usual, our prepared remarks and slides will be in our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Dave Dunnewald and Kevin Kim will be available via telephone or e-mail to assist with any additional questions you may have regarding our quarterly results.", "So, at this point, Rachel, we'd like to open up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Andrea F. Teixeira - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning there. Just \u2013 thank you for taking the question. I wanted to explore more the free cash flow guidance. I know you capped it, but some of the components were actually more favorable. So, I was wondering if what led you to be more conservative and if that's related to commodity pressures that you saw throughout the beginning, I mean the first nine months. So, if you can help us like reconcile, again, the free cash flow guidance. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Hey, Andrea. Thanks for your question. I'll let Tracey pick up the specifics. I would just remind you that we've already increased the free cash flow guidance as we've come through this year.", "So, Tracey, do you want to just talk about the components and the cash flow performance?", "Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. So, hi, Andrea. So, free cash flow has got many factors that drive it and so for that reason, we do talk to our free cash flow guidance in the sort of plus and minus ranges. So, this quarter, we have reduced our CapEx guidance to $650 million, plus or minus 5%. So, we've reduced it and also tightened the range. This is partially due to identifying ways to achieve our cost savings and synergies while spending or investing less in our breweries and in our RT space (25:37) as we continue with our integration plan.", "So, other than that reduction in CapEx, the odd effect is that obviously go into free cash flow. Earnings is one of them, but also a big driver is our working capital. So, for example, December is a big collections month and depending on the timing of our collections, that will play into our free cash flow.", "So, we have got a strong track record of delivering our free cash flow. Year-to-date, our free cash flow delivery has been very strong, which has actually helped us to make an incremental $200 million contribution to our pension plan. So, we're very comfortable with our free cash flow guidance and we are confident that we will be within that range.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you for the opportunity. Good morning, everyone.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Hey, Laurent. How are you?", "Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Good. There was a large difference between the sales to retailers and sales to wholesalers in the U.S. this quarter. So, are you back to a right level of inventory at wholesaler level or are you low and we should expect, I mean, a bump in Q4? And in general, what in your view is the right level of wholesaler inventory level in number of days?", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yes. So, let me ask Gavin to pick that up against the backdrop of what's an ongoing aspiration to try and ship to consumption. So, Gavin, do you want to just talk about some of the specifics on as we've come through Q2 and Q3 and then how we see the balance of year?", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Sure, Mark. Thanks and good morning, Laurent. The distributor inventory was reduced in the third quarter, because we had higher-than-planned levels at the end of the second quarter, which is something we called out on the last conference call. Distributed inventories into the third quarter were actually in line with the prior-year levels and that's for sure helped us improve our service to our customers as we've had almost 50% reduction in out of stocks compared to the last year.", "I'd also make a point that the third-quarter STWs were negatively impacted because we had one fewer trading day in the quarter. So, year-to-date, our trading-day-adjusted domestic STRs are down about 2.3% and our domestic STWs are down 3.8%. And on a full-year basis, we would anticipate that these numbers would converge as we expect distributed inventories compared to the prior year increase a little bit by a day or two in support of the go-live of our Golden system ordering tool early next year.", "Having said all that, we do expect full-year domestic STWs to be slightly below our comparable STR change, because the build-up at the end of 2016 was larger than I expected build-up at the end of 2017. So, a lot of detail there. I hope that answers the question.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Hey, Vivien.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So, I wanted to take the opportunity to revisit Canada and cannabis in light of Constellation's deal announcement earlier this week. So, a two-part question, if you don't mind. Number one, kind of your current assessment of kind of the Canadian cannabis in terms of potential risk factors and how you're thinking about potentially supporting the business next year from an investment standpoint and then, secondly, your appetite to explore that market? Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Vivien, let me pick that up. And obviously, being based here in Colorado, we're very familiar with cannabis, as it's been legalized here. And clearly this is something that, as the whole legal landscape continues to change, we're actively working to understand. We have a team of people working on that. We're looking at potential impacts and/or the opportunities associated with and we're developing a range of responses. Those will be discussed across our executive team and our boards and there'll be more to follow in due course. I don't think we have any statement beyond that to make at this point in time.", "I think the important thing is to make sure we don't get caught in some kind of adrenaline rush. We're very thoughtful, very purposed and we're very clear on how we want to respond to both what could be challenges and what also could be opportunities. So, more to come in due course.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC", "Great. Thank you very much. Your U.S. revenue per hectoliter I thought was pretty impressive, given a tough comp on that number, and you came in better than your primary U.S. competitor. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the drivers for revenue per hectoliter in the U.S., price/mix and how perhaps you're improving your revenue management practices. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Robert, and I'll ask Gavin to talk the specifics. I mean, again, just a couple of context points. Gavin and his team are driving for, I would say, a very disciplined approach in our U.S. business. And then, clearly, we've made some changes in terms of our whole price promotion approach as we've come into 2017. So, I think they are important context points, but, Gavin, do you want to talk about the specifics and how you and the team are driving the NSR per hec?", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Right. What I mean, Robert, as you know, a number of different factors go into our domestic NSR per hectoliter. We've got things that we've talked about in the past like FET drawbacks and freight and fuel revenue adjustments which we make, and then, of course, there's frontline pricing and product promotions and sales mix. I mean in the quarter, sales mix was actually negative because of the success that we had behind our economy strategy.", "At the same time, we had tremendous progress on Blue Moon Belgian White, which continues to grow and grow strongly as one of the few large cross-brands in the country that is actually growing. And we had a record performance from Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy. So, pleasing progress on our above-premium portfolio. And, as Mark said, we put a constant focus on our revenue management initiatives and that's an ongoing effort.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. I mean, I think the only thing I would add to that, Gavin and Robert, is that right across our business, building our capability around pricing and revenue management is central to our whole commercial excellence approach. And if you look at the U.S., Canada and Europe, you're seeing very solid progress when you look at how we're managing one of the critical components of our top line and that's our revenue per hectoliter. So, I feel pleased with progress and we'll continue to focus in that area.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Good morning, Judy. Normally, you're first on, Judy?", "Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "I guess I was pretty slow this morning. So, Mark, I think in your prepared comment, you commented that management priority is first to focus on generating cost savings for bottom line growth. So, in light of what seems to be a much tougher industry environment for volume in the U.S. market, I just wanted to hear from you sort of what you're doing differently to generate more bottom line growth in the near term, not just the year-to-date EBITDA growth as relatively modest. And then just one clarification on the STW and STR kind of piecing together all of the things that Gavin said, are we expecting in the fourth quarter that STW to still be below the STR?", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Okay. So, let me just start with the second question. Gavin, do you want to just come back to Judy just on her question on STW expectations in Q4?", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Sure, I can, Mark. Thanks. Look. Judy, I mean \u2013 as I said, that we would expect to be closer to shipping to consumption for the full year as we \u2013 so, those two will converge in the fourth quarter. So, put simplistically, STWs will probably be slightly better than STRs in the fourth quarter, yes.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Okay. Thanks, Gavin. And then, Judy, just on your first point, I mean just to clarify, I didn't say cost savings was our number one priority. What I said is when you look at our drive to improve both our top and bottom line, clearly, our number one priority is to make sure we're delivering on the bottom line both from a EBITDA margin expansion, absolute EBITDA growth and free cash flow focus and clearly getting our top line moving is a priority, second priority, because it's the best source of sustainable profit growth over the medium to longer term.", "So, both of those things have got to work in tandem, but we've got to make sure we deliver on our bottom line financial performance. I'm encouraged by the fact that if you look at our cost saving plan \u2013 the three-year cost saving plan of $550 million over the three years, we're off to a great start in 2017. That's coming in stronger and faster than we had expected. We're not going update that cost savings guidance at this stage. If there was any update, we would do that as we kick off our 2018.", "So, continuing to look for more efficient investments to drive our synergies, to further take costs out of the business, to drive productivity and efficiency behind our marketing expenditure is all important. And again, I've reiterated a number of occasions that myself and the management team are ensuring that we're retaining flexibility in our P&L.", "If trading conditions are slightly tougher than anticipated, we have got the ability to flex our P&L to protect and develop our bottom line. So, there's quite a lot in there, but hopefully that gives you a sense as to what we're really driving against as a leadership team.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.", "Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Also a U.S. question certainly for you, Mark, perhaps you too, Gavin, can you give us a sense of the budgeting dialogue as you head into 2018? And I'm particularly, of course, interested in the more discretionary items, marketing and other things that influence the top line as it does seem like flat is not a likely outcome in spite of the benefit you'll get from Sol and Arnold Palmer. So, just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about spending and whether that flat objective is still what you're thinking about.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "So, if I get behind your question, Mark, I think what you're asking is, are we going to spend a level irrespective of the impact that just drives flat volume? And again, I've been very consistent that we're not driving for flat volume and growth in the U.S. at any cost. We've been very clear that, that strategic ambition is, I think, very, very appropriate. We want our business back into growth in the U.S. Clearly, that was assumed against a backdrop of U.S. industry volume, which was probably closer to flat. U.S. industry volumes are not as strong as that.", "So, it may take a little bit longer to get there. It doesn't change our strategic intent in the U.S. and you've seen a couple of indications as how we want to build out our portfolio with Sol and Arnold Palmer. We continue to work on other initiatives that hopefully will flow through as well in due course. So, just coming back to the specifics of your question, we'll spend a level that's appropriate to build our portfolio and also continue to drive strong financial performance in the U.S.", "So, Gavin, I don't know whether you'd want to add any additional color around that.", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "No, I don't. Thanks, Mark.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Okay. So, Mark, hopefully that answers your question.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Bryan.", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Hi, Bryan.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Just wanted to follow up first on Mark's question just around volume and maybe Judy's question as well, in the third quarter, with the volumes coming in, and presumably STWs came in below what you were originally planning, was there much that you did during the third quarter to offset the volume shortage or did it all happen so suddenly, there wasn't much you can do to adjust and it would have been even much more leverage if there was more volume? Just trying to get a sense if there was any remedial actions you took in response to the volume declines. And then, I have a follow-up.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. So, I mean, I think it's fair to say we've come through both Q2 and Q3 and industry demand in the U.S. has been more sluggish than it was anticipated. And again, we've been consistent that we're retaining flexibility in our P&L to ensure that we've got levers to pull if volume isn't coming through as anticipated. We did that through the third quarter.", "Clearly, some parts of a discretionary spend is more fixed than others if you're in big contract, for example, and sponsorships, but whether it's the U.S., Canada or our other business units, we retain that flexibility to offset any volume weakness. Clearly, you can do that up to a certain point. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do as we've come through the third quarter. Again, that's very consistent with how we've thought about managing our P&L over the course of the last 12 to 18 months.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tristan van Strien with Redburn Partners. Please go ahead.", "Tristan van Strien - Redburn (Europe) Ltd.", "Hi. Morning, guys. One for Gavin. I just want to ask about Sol distribution to U.S. In terms of what share of your current distributors actually doing Corona at the moment and to what extent is that a barrier? And maybe to follow-up on that, how are you thinking about Sol? Is this about getting distribution or is it more about velocity in the first few years? Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Tristan. Gavin, do you want to jump straight into that?", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. I would say, Tristan, probably two-thirds to three-quarters of our distributors have Corona, roughly. Look, I think it's really early for us on Sol. We've only had it since the 1st of October. We've seen a lot of excitement from our distributors. We've seen it from our retailers. The transition is going well. It's been a tremendous cross-functional effort over the last few months.", "We're working closely with Heineken in Mexico to ensure a smooth transition and we're excited about it. It's a very sessionable lager, it's got a great brand story. It's been around for a tremendously long period of time since 1899 and it fills a nice gap in our portfolio, which we've been under pressure to fill that gap on the Mexican portfolio. Now, we've got Sol and we're excited about it.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Gavin. Back to you, Rachel.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Good morning, everyone.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Hi, Pablo.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Look, just I wanted to stay within the one question limit, but maybe for Gavin, when we look at the STRs in the first half, they were down 2%, in the third quarter, down 2.9%. Can you just say \u2013 indicate at a portfolio level whether the three buckets worsen or something worse than more than the other? By the three buckets, I mean, you know your value brands, which I think is 30% of volumes, your mainstream brands, and then what, above mainstream. So, you can give color in that regard.", "And then, related to that, whether \u2013 you can also answer the same question on a channel basis relative to the trends in the first half, did on-premise worsen more than off-premise? I suppose the hurricanes affect more on-premise business than off-premise. If you can comment on that please, Gavin. And if I may \u2013 I'm allowed, will like to ask a follow-up. Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "I'm not sure who's in charge with follow-ups, Pablo, but, Gavin, why don't you take that one?", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Okay. Lots of questions within that one question limit mark. So, let me try and address it. Look, I mean our third quarter STR volumes were down 2.9%. It was a little worse than the earlier track record and I think it's safe to say that the industry had a tough summer. If you look at the various components in the three segments as you call it out, economy, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in economy. We've set our target two years ago that we wanted to halve the decline in our economy portfolio and maintain share and we've achieved that and in fact we grew share in the third quarter. So we're very pleased with that outcome.", "Premium Light's had a tough summer for a variety of reasons. There was a significant discounting from a spirits point of view. On-premise traffic, to answer your channel-specific question, had declined during the prior year. Millennials are going out less. Latino shoppers changed their shopping behavior in 2017. We'd \u2013 certainly, we're impacted by the two hurricanes that we had, which would obviously have a short-term negative impact on the industry, but a more positive impact going forward.", "And, again, on above-premium, we're making really nice progress on this. Blue Moon continues to grow and grow well. It's one of the few large craft brands in the country that are growing and we're pleased with that turnaround. Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy had a record summer. So, we were very pleased with the performance of that brand.", "Our four craft companies are doing really well and we've got Peroni, which has got growth, which is accelerating. Redd's needs more work from our side, but Redd's Wicked is doing particularly well. And we're excited by our proposition with Hard Soda and with Sparkling sell-throughs and believe both of those brands and the category are here to stay. So, I think I covered most of your questions in that answer, Pablo and Mark.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "As you are trying to address the \u2013 as you're trying to improve the STR trends, I mean, obviously value and above-mainstream are doing better than before, right? But overall trends are not improving, they are worsening. So, the key issue boils down to Miller Lite and Coors Light and is that brand-specific or is it segment-specific? Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Well, we're very pleased with our performance on Miller Lite in particular. It continues to grow share and it's doing well in a declining segment. Coors Light has admittedly had a challenging year, but we believe we've got the right campaign with Climb On and we need to build on that campaign and bring the world's most refreshing beer more directly to the fore. So, we're very happy with our two offerings in the Premium Light segment, Pablo.", "Operator", "A follow-up question from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead.", "Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thank you for taking that. Just clarity, I didn't catch it, Tracey, the CapEx coming down, order of magnitude $100 million. Were you saying that's a timing issue? Will it show up next year? And in the higher-end of the tax rate guide, I know this is a second question, but is that a view for the longer term? Should we just think about your tax rate being a little higher beyond this year?", "Tracey Joubert - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. Hi, Mark. So, yeah, just to recap on the CapEx, so this is not timing. We identified ways to achieve our cost savings and synergies and while spending less in our CapEx on both at our breweries and in the RT space (46:09). So, it is a reduction, a true reduction in 2017.", "In terms of tax rates, so, yeah, the underlying tax rate is at the higher-end of what our previous guidance was. This is really relating to geography mix. A lot of our or most of our income comes from the U.S. at the higher tax rate. And then, also, we had some discrete items in 2016 and 2017. 2016 was favorable and 2017 was negative, which did drive that. In terms of going forward, we will update our tax guidance next year. So, I'll leave that until then, Mark.", "Mark David Swartzberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Very, very helpful. Thanks, Tracey.", "Operator", "The next question is a follow-up from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Actually, I have two, if that's okay. One is just a simple, and maybe I missed this, but did you quantify in the U.S. how much you think the storms affected your STWs and STRs?", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "We didn't, Bryan, and I think if you're looking for comparisons or read-across from ourself against our biggest competitor, clearly, there was slightly different circumstances because our major breweries in the areas that were affected by hurricanes weren't really impacted in the same way. So, I mean clearly, there's been some impact, but we didn't call it out as a material impact on our volume performance.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And there's no ongoing effect at this point, you're back to normal service levels in Florida. And I guess Puerto Rico would be the one area where that's not the case, but, for the most part, you're back to normal service levels.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. I mean, Puerto Rico, as you say, and some of the other Caribbean islands, which are important markets for us, are struggling to get back on their feet. And that's going to be kind of a longer path back to normality there. I think it's fair to say in the U.S., our distributors are working very hard to get back to normal service.", "Gavin, I don't know whether you'd want to offer any color on that one?", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah, we're back to normal service, Mark, across the board. And from a brewery point of view, as you said, we have virtually no disruptions at our Fort Worth brewery and the Albany brewery was down for two days, but picked back up very quickly. So, no real impact.", "Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks.", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Bryan.", "Operator", "The next question is a follow-up from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you. Just for Tracey. So, I look at EBITDA margin expansion in MillerCoors in the third quarter, very impressive given that you had this operating deleverage with shipments being down 7%, but that's being masked, obviously, by this doubling of corporate expenses. So, two questions there. When we think about 2018, are those corporate expenses continue to be a headwind or are they going to be pretty much flat year-on-year in absolute terms?", "And the second question related to all of this, we talk about shifting media from production to customer-facing and those type of things, but how are these corporate expenses, whether we call them centers of excellence or other things, how are they going to help the top line anyway? Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Okay. So, Pablo, let me pick up on that. So, firstly, we haven't doubled underlying corporate expenses. There's a chunk in there's, it's about $35 million, which is really one-time cost related to some of the synergy capture. So, you've got to make sure that you reverse that out. And we were very clear earlier this year that if you look at our corporate G&A line, there's a difference of about $50 million year-on-year based on the guidance. About 40% of that is really a shift in costs around our business as we've moved some people who were working at a business unit-specific level to take on broader global jobs. So, that's just really a movement of money around our business.", "Another slice of that relates to our global growth team and a big piece of that investment relates to the Miller trademark globally, so as we pull that brand into our business. I mentioned on the script that we're changing the packaging on Miller Lite in 20 countries concurrently. That's a massive effort. And we're driving that centrally, because it's the fastest way to kind of deploy that kind of change in the marketplace.", "So, the investment behind the Miller trademark will remain in that corporate cost. So, again, that doesn't become an incremental headwind as we go into 2018. I think, clearly, we've got start-up costs for things like a World Class Supply Chain 2.0, introduction of global shared services and again, they are now embedded in our cost structure for this year and are not a headwind as we go into next year.", "We'll update on our guidance for 2018 corporate G&A in February, but we'll be working very hard to make sure that that's kind of contained, at worse, flat and more to follow in the specifics around that in due course.", "Pablo Zuanic - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Pablo.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Hey, Vivien.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you for the follow-up. Just in terms of your comment, Mark, on the exploratory committee or working group on candidates, one, can you tell us when that was established? And number two, do they have any early insights into U.S. dynamics, because you've got three years of overlap in the U.S. and more than that even? And then, even in \u2013 like a \u2013 a market like Nevada, we just opened up July 1, the early indications at least from the tax revenue office in Nevada is that liquor tax did come in below expectations. Thanks.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Vivien, are you sure you haven't changed jobs, because this is a high focus for you, that's for sure.", "Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Well, I do believe in the interaction. I think you know that. Yeah.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. I mean I'm not going to get into when we established the team, et cetera. I mean, clearly, as we look across the landscape of both opportunities and challenges, where we've got people working on a whole variety of fronts, which includes this front, so I don't think I need to go into the detail on that.", "Clearly, in Colorado, we're actually seeing the beer industry relatively healthy. So, it's very difficult if you look across different states in the U.S. to get a consistent read. So, we've got a team of people working on it. There's a range of insights are being developed. And as I've said, we'll work through the implications, both good, bad or indifferent, and more to follow on that. I just don't want to be drawn on it. I think it's competitively sensitive.", "And as I've said, we've got to be deliberate and thoughtful about how we respond in due course. So, more to follow in due course and I really don't think there's any value in getting into any of the detail beyond that at this stage.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC", "Thank you very much. I think we all understand that the summer was particularly weak. Our contacts with distributors over the last couple of weeks suggest that business picked up reasonably nicely in October in the U.S. Can you confirm that?", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Hey, Robert, I think you're aware we stopped giving kind of short-term volume guidance. I mean, you've got access to the news and data the same as we are. So, we're not going to be drawn on a few weeks' trends. I just refer you to the publicly available news and data.", "Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Let me try something else then. Going back to revenue per hectoliter, you also had pretty strong results in Europe on the revenue per hectoliter side and I don't know how much of that is kind of on an organic basis or if there were sort of one-time items or things that weren't comparable, but perhaps you could give us some insight there.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Sure. And I'll let Simon talk to the Europe performance, which has been consistently strong as we've come through 2017. So, Simon, do you want to talk about the portfolio approach and the balance that you're leaving for across the P&L?", "Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Thanks, Robert. So, I mean your question was \u2013 I think, Robert, pointing to, is it one-off or is it underlying? If you looked at Q2, I think (55:18) was up 3.7% and in this quarter, it's up 4.1%. So, we're posting fairly consistent results.", "We've done that really through a mix of price and mix. So, our pricing was up 1.7% in the quarter. Our mix is up 2.4%. And you would have heard us talk, I think, very consistently now about our attempt to premiumize our portfolio. So, if you look at our premium brands, they were up double-digit in the quarter. If you look at our craft brands, they were up high-single digit.", "Cider continues to work well for us and generally as a premiumization opportunity in the UK. Our core brands performed well and they were competitive in the marketplace. And we have been thoughtful about our value brands and actually they declined at low-single digits in the quarter, which we are very comfortable with.", "So, if you put all that together, we think that's the right sort of pricing, mix and volume curve, because, as you know, we also grew volume strongly and we continue to try and do that in Europe and manage with a balanced portfolio, investing behind our brands, premiumizing our portfolio, driving craft and making sure that we're not fueling any move towards value in some of our Eastern European markets.", "That worked well in Q1, worked well in Q2, worked well in Q3. So, I would describe it as an organic underlying trend that we're leading for. And to your very question, there aren't some funnies or some (56:50) one-offs in there.", "Robert Ottenstein - Evercore Group LLC", "That's terrific. Congratulations on the great result.", "Simon Cox - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thank you.", "Gavin Hattersley - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Robert.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Thanks, Robert. Rachel, back to you.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.", "Mark R. Hunter - Molson Coors Brewing Co.", "Yeah. Thanks, Rachel, and thank you to everybody for joining us today for your interest in the Molson Coors Brewing Company and we look forward to speaking with you again at our forthcoming investor meetings and as we get to our Q4 results.

[Operator Instructions] Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Hunter, President and CEO of Molson Coors.", "Mark Hunter", "Thank you, Phil, and hello and welcome, everybody, to the Molson Coors earnings call, and many thanks for joining today. With me on the call this morning from Molson Coors, we have Tracey Joubert, our Global CFO; Gavin Hattersley, the COO of our U.S. business; Fred Landtmeters, our Canada CEO; Simon Cox, the CEO of our Europe business; Sergey Yeskov, our new International CEO; who earlier this year moved over from leading our commercial teams in Canada; Lee Reichert, our incoming Chief Legal and Corporate Affairs Officer; Brian Tabolt, our Global Controller; and Dave Dunnewald, the Global VP of Investor Relations.", "Now before diving into results, I wanted to take a moment to publicly recognize a couple of people. Firstly, Sam Walker, who's led our legal and corporate affairs team and has been on our executive team for almost 13 years; Sam is retiring from our business at the end of this month to pursue an exciting opportunity in the public service sector in Colorado. For me personally, three enormous change; Sam has been a trusted adviser, good friend, and a constant champion for our Company and everything it stands and strives for. These are big shoes to fill in, and we're delighted to have Lee Reichert ready to step into this important role next month.", "Secondly, I want to recognize Dave Dunnewald, our Investors Relations VP; who has announced he will retire in the first half of this year. Dave celebrates 35 years' service this year and started when our beers were only sold in 18 Western states. For the last 26 year, Dave has led our IR efforts; he has led 113 quarters of earnings calls and has seen our enterprise value grow from less than $1 billion to almost $30 billion. Well done, Dave, and thank you. And best wishes to you as you step into your next chapter.", "So back to business; and today, Tracey and I will take you through our path to drive long-term total shareholder returns, highlighting fourth quarter and full year 2017 results and discuss our outlook for the business. We're also offering slides to show results on Investors Relations page of our website.", "2017 marked the first full year of the bigger, stronger Molson Coors, and our full year results demonstrated balance and progress against both, our bottom line and top line growth. Integration, synergies and cost savings were all delivered on or ahead of plan by engaged employees around the world to align buying their First Choice for consumer and customer ambition. Our primary focus remained on driving margin expansion and bottom line growth with emphasis on productivity and cost savings, efficient commercial investments, and deleverage to maintain our investment grade debt ratings.", "Secondly, we remain focused on delivering an improved top line through our commercial excellence approach, which provides a more sustainable source of profit growth over the medium to longer term. Capital allocation within our business continues to be guided by our Profit After Capital Charge or PACC approach as we seek to deliver total shareholder returns. ", "For the full year versus pro forma results a year ago, we over-delivered on cost savings and free cash flow and optimized commercial spending, delivering a very strong net income growth, underlying EBITDA margin expansion of 77 basis points and underlying EBITDA growth of 3.7%. We also strengthened our balance sheet by more than $900 million through debt pay down and pension contribution as part of our deleveraging strategy. This was complemented by an improving top line with global brand volume growth of 1% and net sales per hectoliter growth of 2.6%, driven by enhanced revenue management and portfolio premiumization. We also grew market share in Canada and Europe for the year and delivered positive underlying EBITDA in our International business.", "Across our business, we continue to focus on portfolio premiumization. Above Premium brand volumes increased 6% in the quarter and 21% for the year, with the full year benefiting from the added Miller international volumes. This Above Premium performance also benefited from strong growth across our global craft portfolio. With this strong growth, Above Premium now represents 20% of our total annual brand volumes. Importantly, we also delivered more than $1.4 billion of underlying free cash flow, as all part of the business drove cash execution and efficiency throughout the year.", "So if we take a step back from the quarter and the year, our track record over the last few years reflects consistency and earning more, using less and investing wisely. Our enterprise and regional teams have earned more by energizing our core Above Premium and craft portfolio through existing brands, as well as successful bolt-on acquisitions, with Apple Cider in the U.K. being the most recent addition to our portfolio. We're using less by over-delivering on cost savings and as our lower cost to achieve, which is in part driven by closing two breweries in Europe and one in the U.S.; and we've continued to invest wisely with strong free cash flow generation and deleveraged focus. Later this year, we plan to update you regarding how we expect our approach to capital allocation to evolve as we approach our deleverage targets.", "I personally am very proud of our achievement in 2017 against the backdrop of complex structural and brand portfolio integration. Highly engaged teams across geographies and functions have executed with brilliance and stayed focused on our First Choice ambition and financial goals. Our integration work streams delivered foundational work to drive future productivity and savings, and our commercial team strengthened their brand portfolio and our customer relationships, which will be key to our success as we play to win every day.", "And now let me turn the call over to Tracey to give you financial highlights. Tracey?", "Tracey Joubert", "Thank you, Mark, and hello, everyone. Let's review our consolidated financial headlines for the fourth quarter versus pro forma results a year ago except for cash flow which is reported on a full year actual basis. Also, keep in mind that in the fourth quarter of 2017, we changed our method of calculating pension plan assets used to determine our net periodic pension costs, which favorably impacted our Canada, Europe and consolidated results. ", "Net sales increased 4.5% due to positive global pricing, royalty revenue, favorable foreign currency movements and starting [ph] a $50 million indirect tax provision from a year ago, partially offset by lower financial volume. Net sales in constant currency grew 2.4%. Net sales per hectoliter increased 5.8% and 3.7% in constant currency. Worldwide brand volume decreased 1.1% due to lower volume in the U.S. and international, partially offset by growth in Europe and Canada. Global priority brand volume decreased 1.9%, and financial volumes decreased 1.2%, driven by the U.S.", "Our U.S. GAAP net income increased from a loss last year to income of $588 million this year; this improvement was primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to that revaluation of our deferred tax balances which resulted from the recent U.S. tax reform along with favorable underlying performance in stocking and impairment charge for the Molson brands in Canada and an indirect tax provision in Europe reported a year ago. Underlying EBITDA increased 17% on a reported basis and increased 14.3% on a constant currency basis. This strong underlying performance was driven by positive pricing, cost savings and MG&A efficiencies, partially offset by the impact of lower volumes, inflation and investments behind our global business capabilities. Results also benefited from indirect tax provision a year ago and higher net pension benefits. Underlying EBITDA margins improved 198 basis points during the quarter.", "Looking at the full year; net debt of $10.9 billion was more than $600 million lower than at the beginning of the year, despite $280 million of unfavorable foreign currency movements. We also made more than $300 million of contribution to our defined benefit pension plan as part of our overall pension derisking strategy and deleveraging goals. Underlying free cash flow of $1.4 billion was up 68% from actual results last year. The prior guidance was driven by benefits from timing of working capital at the end of the year, as well as capital expenditure reduction. In the past several years, we had made substantial progress in improving the efficiency of our balance sheet to help generate cash and drive higher cash returns on our assets. As seen on this slide, we have a consistent track record of improving working capital as a percentage of sales in each of the past 6 years, and we have more progress to make in the years ahead.", "For the full year, we improved underlying EBITDA by 4.3% in constant currency with underlying EBITDA margin expansion of 77 basis points for the year. Our top line for the year also benefited from strong net sales per hectoliter growth and total worldwide brand volume up 1%. Now I'd like to share some regional highlights.", "In the U.S., we grew underlying EBITDA 4.9% in the fourth quarter versus pro forma results last year, driven by higher net pricing, cost savings and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by cost inflation and lower shipment volume. Overall, U.S. STRs declined 3% for the quarter, and domestic sales to wholesalers declined 1.5%. This quarter marked the 13th consecutive quarter of increased signatory [ph] of Miller Lite elevating the brand to the number 3 beer in America according to Nielsen. Coors Light remains the number 2 beer and completed its 11th consecutive quarter of increased segment share. Our Below Premium brand portfolio was down low-single digits and achieved its best quarterly trend since the third quarter of 2009. We also gained share of segment and industry with our Below Premium brand in the quarter through Nielsen led by the Keystone family. ", "Our full year U.S. underlying EBITDA increased 2.7% versus pro forma results last year, driven by 1% increase in domestic net sales per hectoliter, cost savings and lower MG&A expenses, partially offset by cost inflation and a 2.9% decrease in domestic STR volumes. For the year, we gained market share within the Premium Light and Premium Regular segments as Coors Banquet completed its 11th consecutive year of growth. And in the Above Premium, Blue Moon Belgian White grew during each quarter and continued to acquire incremental [indiscernible]. Leinenkugel's was up low-single digits for the year, propelled by Summer Shandy's best volume year in the brand's history.", "For the year, we also held share within the Below Premium segment which was one of our 2017 goals. Our Canada underlying EBITDA declined 4.2% in the fourth quarter on a reported basis and 8.4% on a constant currency basis, driven by inflation and higher distribution cost, partially offset by positive pricing, lower MG&A expenses and favorable foreign currency. Our brand volumes increased 0.8%, and market share during the quarter was consistent with the prior year with share gains in the Above Premium segment. We also drove the top line with 1% net sales per hectoliter growth in constant currency during the quarter.", "One meaningful portfolio highlight in the premium segment was flat volume on an absolute basis during the quarter. While this benefited from incremental Miller Lite volume, our two biggest brands reflected sequential improvements compared to earlier in the year. Full year results benefited from improving trends in the fourth quarter, however, full year brand volumes declined 0.5% and underlying EBITDA declined 11.6% in constant currency.", "Full year net sales for per hectoliter grew 2.2% in local currency, reflecting positive net pricing and mix. Our Europe team continues to grow both at the bottom and top line. Fourth quarter underlying EBITDA grew 239.5% in constant currency, driven by higher volumes, positive sales mix and increased net pension benefit, as well as the benefit of cycling indirect tax provision a year ago. Brand volume increased 10.4% in the quarter, primarily due to the addition of Miller brands and the transfer of royalty and export brand volumes across Europe from our International business. But even without the incremental volume, we continue to achieve growth from our core and Above Premium brands which helped drive net sales per hectoliter growth.", "For the full year, underlying EBITDA grew strongly, driven by volume growth, positive sales mix and higher net pension benefit, along with cycling the indirect tax provision that was booked in the fourth quarter of 2016 and reversed in the first quarter of 2017. We also grew net sales per hectoliter, as well as our market share as brand volumes increased 10.3% in Europe.", "For our International business, underlying EBITDA was at $0.4 million in the quarter, a $1 million decrease from a year ago, driven by the loss of the Modelo contract in Japan, the transfer of royalty and export brand volume to Europe and high MG&A from the addition of the Miller International business. This was partially offset by the addition of Puerto Rico and volume growth across several Latin American markets. While we were able to grow organic volumes in existing markets, total brand volume decreased 15.1% in the quarter. Reported net sales per hectoliter increased 6.1% due to the favorable sales mix and positive pricing.", "International full year 2017 underlying EBITDA of $3.5 million represented a $7 million improvement from a loss a year ago. Underlying gross profit increased more than 50% to $87.1 million, which exceeded prior guidance as our Caribbean team was able to mitigate some of the anticipated hurricane impacts. International brand volumes were up 28.9%, and reported net sales per hectoliter increased 0.8%.", "While our earnings release provides more detail, I want to spend a moment to share the following financial highlights for 2018. Underlying free cash flow of $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, which excludes the recently disclosed $330 million cash proceeds related to resolving a purchase price adjustment. As I mentioned earlier, 2018 free cash flow will be tracking some timing of working capital benefits in 2017. Cost savings guidance of $210 million in 2018 is part of our newly increased 3-year savings target of $600 million, up from our previous target of $550 million for 2017 to 2019; this represents an acceleration of the related cost savings into years 1 and 2 of the 3-year program. We now also estimate that our cost to catch-up synergies for the program will be $250 million, down from $350 million previously due to efficiencies in both, capital spending and non-core operating expenses.", "Delivering on the savings commitments will be particularly important this year given recent increases in input costs such as aluminum and fuel. We currently anticipate an inflation headwind across our company in 2018 that is more than $50 million larger than in 2017, driven by aluminum, diesel fuel and other factors.", "Please see our earning release this morning for specific cost of goods raised guidance by business unit for 2018. Our cost savings remains a way of life at Molson Coors, and as we have previously committed, we will deliver on the current 3-year cost savings program for 2017 through 2019 which we have just increased to $600 million. We are in the process of developing our next 3-year savings program which will be for 2020 through 2022, and we plan to offer details in the first half of 2019.", "Following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, we anticipate approximately $200 million of transaction-related cash tax benefits in 2018 and substantial benefits in the 13 years after this year as seen in this slide. Beyond this, we expect additional cash tax benefits from tax reform, primarily related to lower corporate income tax rate and accelerated depreciation of qualified assets for tax. Additionally, following the enactment of U.S. tax reform, we expect an underlying effective tax rate in the range of 18% to 22% in 2018. This rate is 6 to 8 percentage points lower than prior to tax reform and reflects a substantial benefit to offset tax underlying income and earnings per share for our shareholders. We currently expect a long-term effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%.", "Please keep in mind, additional definitive guidance from the U.S. government regarding implementation of the recently passed tax reform legislation could impact this outlook. It is also important to highlight that our 2018 results will be impacted by $850 million of underlying depreciation and amortization, which represents an approximate $50 million increase from 2017. This increase is driven primarily by information system and investments in the U.S., including in our order systems, which will make it easier for our customers to do business with us.", "Additionally, 2018 results will be impacted by the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and pension and OPEB accounting guidance, as well as changes to segment reporting related to pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. With these changes in pension accounting, we expect $46 million of Europe pension income in 2017 to move to our corporate results. The new revenue recognition accounting standard became effective for us at the beginning of 2018 and prior year's results will not be restated. Along with some timing change, we currently anticipate that this change will reduce both, net sales and MG&A expenses by approximately $70 million to $90 million during 2018, primarily within our Canada segment, with no significant impact on net income. The impacts of these accounting changes are discussed in further detail with Input Note 2 of our 2017 Form 10-K.", "Consistent with last year, our focus in 2018 will be ensuring that our business generates strong cash flow as we strengthen our balance sheet and deliver cost savings while increasing our EBITDA margins over the next 3 to 4 years. As Mark mentioned, we tend to revisit our 3 baskets of capital allocation priorities later this year which include returning cash to shareholders, strengthening our balance sheet and growth opportunities such as M&A and brand investments. But in the near-term, we will focus further on strengthening our balance sheet while maintaining our annual dividends.", "And at this point, I'll turn it back over to Mark.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Tracey. I'll begin the call today by outlining our plans to drive total shareholder returns. Going forward, we believe our ambition to be First Choice of our consumers and customers will be central to our bottom and top line success. Our regional business priorities are clear and consistent.", "In the U.S. 2017 industry dynamics were challenging, our teams continue to be disciplined, decisive and accountable as we continue to deliver long-term profit growth. We've grown underlying EBITDA in the U.S. substantially since 2009 including in difficult trading conditions. And this year, exemplified that ability as we grew underlying EBITDA 4.9% in the quarter from 2.7% for the full year. We know we have the brands, the plants and the teams to achieve our goals, which includes our growth agenda. Our objective for flat volumes by 2018 and growth by 2019 remains our strategic comparator. While we're not driving for growth at any cost we will strengthen and expand our portfolio, drive investment efficiency through ROMI, or return on marketing investment, and also through global procurement and the use of PACC, and will continue to earn category captainships underpinned by tools such as Building with Beer as these are all steps to help us and our partner to sell more beer, more profitably.", "Within our brand portfolio, we'll continue to gain segment share in premium, grow in Above Premium and continue to stabilize our Below Premium brand volume. We'll refresh Coors Light packaging and release new creative over the next couple of months while continuing to build momentum buying Miller Lite, the original light beer. Within Above Premium, we'll accelerate our performance by building on solid growth in 2017 from our two national craft brands, Blue Moon Belgian White and Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, as well as the strong growth of our regional brands including Terrapin, Hop Valley, Revolver, Saint Archer and Colorado Native.", "Additionally, excitement from our distributor and chain partners for our 2018 innovation lineup is also apparent with tens of thousands of incremental placements already committed. This whole brand will be launched in April with redesign packaging supported by an integrated marketing campaign. Alongside Peroni [ph], which is also accelerating, we will have a strong one-two punch in the import segment. Additionally, and just a past few weeks we've brought to retail Arnold Palmer Spiked [ph], designed to take share in the valuable hard tea segment and Two Hats positioned to bring new legal age drinkers into beer.", "In Canada, our teams are building on improved 2017 momentum. Our consumer excellence teams will continue to focus on gaining segment share in premium, accelerating our growth in Above Premium and craft and stabilizing our Below Premium brand share. Our number 1 priority for our brands remains on improving the performance of Coors Light and Molson Canadian by refocused marketing, improved customer promotions and stronger commercial execution. Above Premium performance will be driven by Coors Banquet, MGD, Belgian Moon and the Heineken portfolio.", "In addition to listing and shifting Miller highlights to Canada, we will introduce two further brands from our U.S. portfolio to broaden and deepen our Canadian portfolio later this year. And we're also going out to incremental drinking locations by launching some great tasting innovation in the non-alcohol segment in 2018, with more details to follow in due course. In the customer excellence front, we'll continue to rollout proven best practice tools such as building with beer, and alongside this commercial excellence continues to focus on sales productivity, customer 360 initiatives, and joint business planning resulting in strong and market impact.", "Supply chain themes in Canada continue with brewery optimization efforts and productivity improvements as we're just over a year from opening our new British Columbia brewery, and the new Montr\u00e9al brewery is expected to begin production in 2021.", "In Europe, the environment remains competitive, we'll continue to use our balanced portfolio approach, drive disciplined retail execution and optimize our brewery network. In 2018, there are a few headwinds that are important to remember when modeling the results for our Europe business. In the first quarter, we will be cycling the $30 million indirect tax provision benefit from 2017. In addition, throughout 2018 we will increase investment behind our brands and commercial priorities to further strengthen our First Choice agenda. And lastly, as Tracey highlighted, as a result of the changes in pension accounting we expect $46 million of Europe pension income in 2017 to move to corporate results.", "Our commercial teams will build on our positive momentum this year by strengthening our national mainstream brands, including Carling, our largest brand in Europe, which further strengthens its overall number 1 position in the U.K. beer market in 2017. For our Above Premium portfolio, 2017's double-digit sales growth reflects the fact that Ice Cold Rocky Mountain refreshment is resonating powerfully with Coors Light consumers in the U.K. and Ireland. Above Premium Staropramen, outside of its domestic market has grown at double-digit rates, and we continue to push the brand into new markets with a check Providence and quality can deliver growth in the Above Premium segments.", "To accelerate our growth in craft, led by Sharps and Franciscan Well, we've added [indiscernible] brands to our portfolio and with Cider we're building on strong growth by Carling Cider and Rekorderlig with the 2018 acquisition of Asphalt [ph], a growing Cider brand founded in 1720 with a distinct face, place and story that supports our premiumization strategy. Our balanced portfolio approach also relies in continuing commitment to deliver against our focus to become the first choice for customers. We maintained our number 1 supplier ranking in the U.K. advantage retail survey for the multiple grosser off-premise channel, and also recently achieved a number 1 ranking in the multiple on-premise channel for the first time.", "With integration of that Miller International business largely complete and with nearly 4.4 million hectoliters of total brand volume in 2017, our International business has increased substantially over the past year and is now more than half as big as our Canada business from our volume perspective. We'll continue to utilize an asset-light model in select markets and our efforts will focus on global priority brands, Coors Light, the Miller trademark and Blue Moon. Coors Light maintains strong growth in Latin America last year, and in Mexico passed 1 million hectoliters of brand volume, making it the fourth largest Coors Light market globally. We're currently launching the Miller Lite original white can packaging to more than 20 markets globally, and while still early days, results for this authentic packaging are very positive.", "Across Molson Coors against a backdrop of integration and challenging market conditions during 2017, we delivered financial and commercial results that demonstrate our balance priorities for bottom and top line growth are working. In 2018, our First Choice focus across regions will continue to strengthen and premiumize our brand portfolio while also deepening our customer relationships. We'll also continue to retain flexibility in our P&L, delivering on our cost savings and remained laser focused in delivering against our cash targets and strengthening our balance sheet.", "Now before we start the Q&A portion of the call, a quick comment. As usual our prepared remarks and slides will be in our website for your reference within a couple of hours this afternoon. Dave Dunnewald and Kevin Kim will be available via telephone or email to assess with any additional questions you may have regarding our quarterly results.", "With this point, Phil, we'd like to open up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Andrea Teixeira", "I wanted to just cycle back to the synergies and the reinvestment; you had an amazing quarter in terms of flow-through, and it was above what you had initially indicated at the Analyst Day. I was just hoping to see how we should be seeing the cadence for 2018 and if this margin was just a catch-up because, obviously, the first 9 months you had a more challenging environment and you had to defend it. So for the full year, you used to had it like within that guidance. So is there anything that has changed, that made -- I mean, obviously, you had $80 million more than you originally anticipated, but how we should be thinking about the range that you gave us at the in terms of for investment? And how we would layer that through your initial thought about stabilizing volumes in the U.S. in 2018? How should we be thinking of that goal going forward as you have more visibility?", "Mark Hunter", "There's quite a lot in there so let me try to answer. If you look at our overall cost savings and synergies, we cleared out very clearly our 3-year exploration, and that transformation was one that had increased following the initial synergy assumption. So we increased synergies, and we accelerated those to get us the $550 million over 3 years. We've now increased that number from $550 million to $600 million. And we've made very good progress in year 1. We actually managed to accelerate some of the savings from years 3 and 2 and to year 1, which was very encouraging. That was important because as we came through 2017, some of the inflation assumptions were actually more negative than we'd anticipated, particularly around aluminum and fuel. So it was important that we over-delivered. And there's no real change that we that we think about allocation of savings within our business.", "Clearly, we're not going to give a formula because it's important that we retain flexibility to use those cost savings as we see appropriate. But obviously, the offset inflation, which was driven principally through commodities, any volume deleverage we're seeing. We're also using some of those cost savings to focus on our global growth and efficiency initiatives. So we set up the next cycle cost savings in our business and things like global shared services and supply chain infrastructure changes are taking place in Canada as a couple of examples, and then a proportion flows through to the bottom line. So that's the way that we tend to look at our cost savings. And alongside those, obviously, as we intimated, we continued to retain flexibility in terms of our overall MG&A to ensure that we deliver EBITDA margin expansion the bottom line improvements.", "I think the second part of your question, related to the U.S. and I think Gavin and I have been very clear that stabilizing our volume in the U.S. is a strategic imperative ahead of moving into absolute growth that the business and volume terms have declined for the best part of 10 years. Our intent is still to deliver this on 2018. If industry volumes are softer than anticipated, it may take a lot longer to get there but it doesn't change this strategic imperative. And we'll make sure we do that in a manner that allows us to grow even though margins and overall EBITDA. In other words, we're not chasing stabilization and growth at any cost, but growth in a measured and balanced way I think the team demonstrated our ability to do that if you look at our EBITDA performance in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and on a full year basis.", "Andrea Teixeira", "So the margins that we saw in the fourth quarter there, you see as real, a real improvement over time in the cadence of the synergies? You saw more synergies heading into the fourth quarter? Or they were pretty much balanced throughout the quarters?", "Mark Hunter", "There were reasonably balanced. And I think what we've said is we're not going to update on a quarterly basis on cost savings and synergies. We'll do that on a full year basis, and we've now giving you an updated guidance and expanded our cost savings aspiration. The thing to bear in mind is, I think, in 2017, inflation giving about $60 million to $65 million ahead of what we anticipated, and we think inflation will grow by about another $50 million as we go into 2018.", "Andrea Teixeira", "And that's on a global basis, I'm assuming, that number?", "Mark Hunter", "That's on a global basis, that's correct. And we also mentioned as well in our guidance, we'll be cycling the benefit direct tax provision reversal in 2017 of -- Q1 of 2017. So there's a few puts and takes as you think about 2018. The improvement and solid financial performance of our business is very real for sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.", "Stephen Powers", "So maybe to build on Andrea's question a little bit, I think we're all impressed with a strong profit and cash performance exiting '17, the raise having objective to better than expected free cash flow for '18. I guess my first question is a bit more detail on where you are sourcing that cast productivity outside from. It sounds like working capital timing played a role. But I'd love also some more color on what drove the decision to spend a bit less than expected on CapEx. And any more color on marketing promotional investment trends that you may be able to offer, that'll be great.", "Mark Hunter", "You covered full sense of the P&L and balance sheet there, Steve. Tracey, do you want to pick up some perspective on Steve's question?", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. So if we look at the free cash flow, which I think is the CapEx reporting to that as well. So the free cash flow remains a focus as we look to meet our deleverage commitment to the rating agencies. So when we look at the $1.5 billion, plus or minus 10%, guidance that we're giving for 2018, I think a couple of things to consider.", "So firstly, we touch on the CapEx. So we actually started speaking about this towards the back half of last year was -- and as we were going through our cost savings and synergies, we found ways to actually spend less behind those initiatives but still continue to deliver the cost savings and synergies, and that spending less came primarily from the CapEx side; so we were able to reduce our CapEx guidance in 2017. And as well in 2018, we'll continue to deliver some CapEx reduction previously thought to be needed around synergies and cost savings through efficiencies and elimination of some projects, so that would not -- that's not timing, that's really efficiencies.", "And then as we look at some of the other big drivers of the free cash flow, just to think about as you're modeling, the cash taxes will be a bit of a headwind in 2018. So just as a reminder, last year, we strengthened our balance sheet through making additional pension contribution of over $300 million. Our pension contribution regarding to in 2018 is $10 million but because of that contribution last year, we actually received a tax refund. This year, we will be paying cash taxes, so that's assuming that will be a bit of a headwind as well.", "And then the timing of the working capital; we also just mentioned this in Q3 I believe -- what is difficult to really accurately forecast is mainly in our European business unit -- we cash collections at year-end timing is difficult because we have thousands of customers in different countries. And in 2017, at the end of 2017, we actually -- we had really strong cash collection at year-end so that's a little bit of a timing, also to consider as you look at our free cash flow, both 2017 and 2018. I hope that helps.", "Mark Hunter", "I think the other thing you mentioned was really around our MG&A spend, particularly the fourth quarter. I think again, we've been very consistent, we'll retain flexibility around our commercial investment, and we're working very hard across our business to drive commercial investment, productivity, principally through the ROMI model but just becomes stronger and stronger in the U.S. and rolled into Canada and it's rolled into the U.K. as well. So really making sure we're driving higher returns out of every existing dollar. And that's allowed us from the back of some of the procurement work we've done as well through get -- give us more flexibility in some of that marketing spend, and we're utilizing that in real time quarter-by-quarter.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Vivien Azer, Cowen.", "Vivien Azer", "I wanted to circle back to the U.S. and get your assessment of some of the strategic moves that you made in 2017 and, in particular, some of the price investments that you made at the low end of the portfolio. Would love kind of a postmortem on how that played out relative to your expectations, in particular as it relates to brand interaction across kind of value or economy and Premium Lights?", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Vivien. Gavin, do you want to pick up specifically and everybody of the portfolio strategy across the 3 major segments and what was delivered in 2017?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Sure. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everybody. Vivien, the first thing that I would say is from a pricing point of view, actually our pricing was pretty similar, actually was slightly up in Q4 versus Q3, notwithstanding the success we've had with our economy strategy. And as Mark said, when we came into our flat by '18 growth, by '19 mantra [ph], 2 years ago we had three building blocks which we we're focusing on and economy was just one of them. We wanted to halt the decline rates in economy and we wanted to hold share; and as we headed out of the fourth quarter, actually we've done better on both of those dimensions, we've more than halved the decline and we actually grew share in the fourth quarter, Keystone played a part of that and so did Hams [ph].", "Premium Lights was the second building block; and there we needed to gain share and obviously, our job in 2018 is to accelerate share. As Tracey said, we gained share of segment for both, Miller Lite and Coors Light in the fourth quarter for the 13th and 11th time, respectively. And then importantly, our Above Premium and as you talk about strategic building blocks, this is where we laid a strong foundation for '17 for action and execution in 2018, particularly around sold, which we're launching on the 1st of April and Arnold Palmer, which we spiked half-from-half which we launched a couple of weeks ago and then building on the growth of the 4 craft companies. And then we also launched Crispin Rose a couple of weeks ago, and that's off to a really solid start.", "And at the same time, we turned around both Blue Moon and Leinenkugel's, which had a difficult 2016, and both of them grew strongly in 2017 as Mark or Tracey said. Does it cover it for you, Mark?", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, Gavin, that's clear. Vivien, the only thing I will add and I think it was behind your question; are there any unintended consequences of our focus on Below Premium, and that's something we are monitoring them carefully. We don't believe that the work we've done on Below Premium is having an impact on other parts of our portfolio. The economy drinkers are our Below Premium drinkers in the U.S. are very, very loyal; and our job is to ensure that we compete effectively in that segment for those loyal drinkers. And as we come into this year, we're also looking to ensure that LDA to 24 drinkers joined the beer category through introduction of our Two Hats brands.", "So we're being very careful about the interaction between the segments and our pricing relativities. And I think we feel pretty good about the strategy and effectiveness of that strategy through 2017.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.", "Eunjoo Hong", "So a question about the revenue per barrel performance in the U.S. So in the quarter, up 1.4%. If you could break down rate versus mix. And then as we think about 2018, you obviously called out some of the inflationary pressure you're seeing on the cost structure. So should we see a year where your revenue per unit is going to be below your cost per unit? Or is there sort of an attempt to get more pricing in the marketplace as the inflation is creeping up.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. So Gavin, do you want to pick up on just on the construct of revenue per barrel in the U.S.? And then Tracey, do want to pick up on 2018 inflation, avoiding any guidance as per Judy's question? Gavin, over to you.", "Gavin Hattersley", "Judy, as you say, we generated 1.4% the fourth quarter, which was about 20 basis points higher than in the third quarter. If you break it out between sort of a net pricing, that was about 180 basis points, and mix was negative 40 basis points. And that negative mix was entirely associated with the packaged mix as it relates to some of our packaging strategies, primarily in Keystone Light. From an overall pricing point of view, I would just point out that 2017 pricing was actually slightly up over 2016 full year pricing, about 10 basis points. As for as 2018 outlook is concerned, Judy, as Mark said, we don't guide there.", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. And then Judy, just in terms of the cost per hectoliter guidance for the U.S., so our guidance is to be up low single-digit for 2018. As Mark also mentioned, the inflation that we are expecting in 2018 is across Molson Coors. This will be more than $50 million higher than we what we saw in 2017.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Robert Ottenstein from Evercore ISI.", "Robert Ottenstein", "Wondered if you could help us out, there's been a lot of kind of weird industry data that's come out -- that's making it a little bit hard to for us to discern what's going on; the beer institute, STWs down high-single digits in December. And then there's the IRI data is very positive for January; Nielsen, not so positive. Can you give us any -- and I think it's attested to what timing issue on the scanner data? But can you give us any sense either in terms of your own business or the industry in terms of what happened with the December shipments and what's going on in January, please?", "Mark Hunter", "Again, assuming your question is specific to U.S., I'll ask Gavin to talk through the detail. Just one thing to remember something from our performance perspective is that our underlying strategy is to shift to consumption. Clearly within our business, there's some pretty significant change initiative still rolling through. So what we call our VPNS or our combined ordering system, which is being going live and golden successfully over the course of the last couple of weeks. And there will be further initiatives on the VPNS initiative as we roll through 2018 and into Q1 2019. But Gavin, can you try and -- try to join the dots differences across the different sources of industry data for December? Is that possible to do?", "Gavin Hattersley", "That's really tough, Mark. I'm trying to draw a line between all of these different industry sources this quite difficult, Robert. I can tell about us. As Mark said, we said on the third quarter called that we're going to take shipments up a little bit or inventories up a little bit in the fourth quarter. So we did that. We took our inventories up by about a day, which is in line with what we said. And that would've positively impacted shipment volumes by about 120 basis points. So it explains most of the difference between the 3 and the 1.5. I mean, I really can't comment on why industry shipments down in December; that's probably a question you should direct at our competitors.", "From a Nielsen and other market sources, our share remains pretty consistent with all of those sources. And I think we discontinued giving guidance on January some time ago so I'm not going to give any input into that.", "Mark Hunter", "The only thing I would add, Gavin and Robert, again if you take a step back, the U.S. industry, beer industry continues to be the largest global profitable in the margin to expand because even with volumes under a little bit of pressure continues to premiumize, so continues to be a great place to compete. And it's probably not something that we get too concerned about in terms of some of the short-term trends and volatility that we see in volume line.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Credit Suisse.", "Laurent Grandet", "It has been a while since the stock has been that much up, I mean, during the course, so congrats on the good quarter. So I'd like to dig a bit more in term of the tax benefit and the cash redeployment. So the press release provides no information on how the company intends to reinvest tax savings. Could you please tell us how you're planning to redeploy coming from a better tax rate. Do you see a party to invest specifically Coors Light and also the new brands like Sol Arnold Palm [ph]?", "Mark Hunter", "Let me take the second question part of your question first, and Tracey can talk about the tax benefits and cash uses in our business. I mean, if you look at a horse our organization, our total marketing spend is close to our marketing spend is close to $1.5 billion. We spent close to $1 billion in the U.S. behind our brands. Their view is that we have the flexibility to support the development of our portfolio. So as we bring new brands in, we continue to drive productivity and efficiency in our commercial spend, and we'll invest a rate that we believe will drive the maximum return. That's through in the U.S., Canada and our European business, and I think we've demonstrated our ability to continue to make that happen.", "So don't expect any kind of material increase or ballooning of commercial investments as we go into 2018. We'll be working our existing dollars very, very hard to drive further productivity and efficiency and impact improvements. Tracey, do you want to talk to tax benefit and cash deployment?", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. So it's -- I look at the end guidance that we've given our transaction-related cash tax benefit. So we're guiding to approximately $200 million of cash tax benefit. Now that is down from what we had previously given before tax reform, and that's really driven by the reduction in the corporate tax rate. But overall, we are a net beneficiary of the tax reform. I'm not going to, at this stage, give you exactly what those details are, but you can see just from the underlying tax rate that we're now guiding to for 2018, which will be between 18% and 22%. That is significantly lower and will provide a net benefit for us. Just in terms of the uses of the tax benefits, as Mark said, our focus is really on deleveraging our business and strengthening our balance sheet.", "So we will continue to generate free cash flow to pay down our debt and maintain our investment grade rating. And then as we said earlier, towards the back half of the year as we get closer to that deleverage targets, we will talk about capital allocations.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Amit Sharma with BMO Capital Markets.", "Amit Sharma", "Mark, two questions, both on U.S. Understand your about price/mix outlook for '18, but can you talk about industry price environment? If everybody is facing inflation, is there appetite within the industry to take adequate pricing? And then second, just on U.S. volumes, really good to see the discipline on investment and yet be able to grow EBITDA margins. Now if industry or let's say volume weak for the industry for the category, do we still have enough confidence that you continue to grow EBITDA margins with that weaker volume environment?", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. So Gavin, if you're just going to tune in here and if I miss anything, please share. Certainly, on the price/mix piece, I'm going to comment on industry level. We're going to play our game that will drive our portfolio, and we'll continue to work very hard to ensure that we offer great value to consumers it's appropriate to our brand equity while premiumizing our overall portfolio. And that's consistent with the U.S., Canada and our European business, that's very central to our business. But I mean, overall, the U.S. volumes in your question around EBITDA margins, we are very clear about what our number 1 priority center business, which is to deliver on our EBITDA margin, development as per our guidance, improve our bottom line and generate strong free cash flow.", "And then secondly, certainly, over the longer to medium term, really start to see improvement in our top line through strengthening and putting our portfolio and strengthening our customer relationships. I think specifically within the U.S., if you look at our EBITDA margins, they've improved sequentially and consistently over the last few years, and we believe now with the MillerCoors part of our of the bigger Molson Coors, there's further opportunities to enhance our EBITDA margins as North American supply chain shared services and the global procurement, which have all got to a great start in 2017 continue to pick up pace through 2018 and 2019.", "So even against a tough industry environment, driving productivity in the business, and securing some of the benefits of integrating as part of Molson Coors still gives us headroom to continue to expand our EBITDA margins.", "Gavin, I don't know whether I missed anything there or if any builds on that?", "Gavin Hattersley", "No, that was a very comprehensive, Mark. I have nothing to add.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Pablo Zuanic from SFG.", "Pablo Zuanic", "I have a two-part question on the synergies in 2017 and the outlook for 2018. And then maybe Mark and Tracey, you can show me if I'm doing the right thing in terms of evaluating the performance. The way I see it, your EBITDA for the year consolidated grew $100 million, right? On the synergies of $255 million, that looks good but U.S. EBITDA, up $50 million; Canada, down $24 million, is down $60 million in two years; our corporate expense is up $85 million; so to some extent, the numbers look good because of these big jump in Europe of around $170 million EBITDA for the year, which to me seems to be a one-off for anything accounting related. So if we strip out Europe, EBITDA for the year was down and little slow.", "So what I'm saying is, when I look at the numbers for 2017, what jumps out as a positive to me is the jump of $50 million in EBITDA in the U.S. But on synergies of $255 million, that's still only 20% realization. Canada seems to be a problem. I don't know if Fred can comment on that margins that are down there for two years in a row? And Europe, the big jump seems to be one-off; so I don't think I can count on Europe growing EBITDA margin next year. Corporate expenses, basically your guidance seems to be flat. So if you can comment on that?", "And then if I can allow a second question for Gavin in terms of our STRs, you know, this kind of data -- when I look at your STRs, down 3% for the quarter, it would be nice if you can break that down between the growth in Above Premium in the U.S., what I call mainstream and then value? And the reason I asked that is that you are -- the data seems to show that mainstream was down about 3%, whereas value was up about 3%, but mainstream is like 2.5 times the size of value. So if you can comment on that -- if there are any channel differences between those three products groups that may be -- made this kind of data being distorted? You can start with the cost question, first. Thank you.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Pablo. As usual, you've used your one/two trick on questions; so we'll try and cover all of the basics here. On the first one, I don't think your analysis on EBITDA is accurate, I mean, our European business has delivered very, very solid top the bottom line performance, volume growth, pricing growth, good cost management and strong EBITDA performance, that was enhanced by the one-off tax provision. But if you strip that out, then we're still seeing very solid performance. And my perspective is our Europe business is kind of a poster side for what we're going to deliver across all of Molson Coors, which is just really solid improvement on our bottom line and a very balanced approach from a top line perspective across volume, premiumization and pricing. So I do think a lot of discredit from a European perspective.", "I think in the U.S., despite a tough backdrop, we are in the process of turning around our overall volume and refining and reshaping the portfolio. And Gavin and his team did a superb job of improving overall EBITDA performance. And as I mentioned in my previous question, I believe there's still further runway to expand our EBITDA margins as MillerCoors is now part of our global organization. Canada, your comments are fair. I mean it's -- we're in the process of turning that business around, and I was very pleased with the performance as we came through the second half of 2017. I think we've given you some indications as to the strengthening of our top line. Our volume was solid. We're back into share growth. We've seen pricing improvements. And what we're trying to do is balanced delivery for the day, while at the same time setting up the productivity improvements so as we look to 2020 to 2022 cost savings programs as well.", "So we're taking some of the cost savings and synergies, use them to offset inflation that was higher than anticipated, and we have been investing for the medium to long term in shared services, world-class supply chain, our commercial excellence capabilities. So my job is to get the balance between delivering for today, which I think we've done very successfully in 2017 while at the same time, setting the business up for the medium to long term. So I'm not sure I would agree -- actually, I am sure, I wouldn't agree with your analysis on our EBITDA performance.", "On the STRs, Gavin, do you want to comment on just the relative performance of each of the kind of major segments within the U.S.?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Right. Sure, Mark. Without getting into specific detail by segment from a performance point of view, in Above Premium, which is where we're putting a lot of emphasis, we grew Blue Moon Belgian White, we grew our core partners and we grew Peroni very strongly. And as I said earlier on, we got a nice platform coming into 2018 with solid and Arnold Palmer and the ones I just mentioned. Our economy portfolio, probably heard of our best performance in 8 years, primarily driven by the success of Keystone Lite. And Mark correctly said that doing extensive analysis on the performance of Keystone Light, and it's having a no material impact on our mainstream brands. It under indexes in terms of going from those 2 brands, and some markets actually provides a Halo. So we're very pleased with the economy portfolio.", "And in Premium Light, as you said, has been challenged in 2017. And Miller Lite's performance actually the fourth quarter is slightly greater than in the third quarter, and Coors Light challenge for us and we're putting a lot of effort behind it to revitalize it, mostly around the road most refreshing beer. We know that it works it works before. It provides a meaningful product benefit for us. It's shown significant growth in equity, and we probably moved a bit too far away from it. So you see of the world's most refreshing beer in a meaningful way as we head into 2018. Beyond that, Mark, I don't think I should give any more specifics.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Thanks, Gavin.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.", "Bryan Spillane", "I had -- well, first, I wanted to say congratulations to Dave. You spent a lot of time and patients handling our questions over the years, and I just want to thank you for that and wish you the best as you go off into retirement.", "David Dunnewald", "Thanks, Bryan. It's been my pleasure.", "Bryan Spillane", "I guess I have one clarification and one question. Tracey, when you talk about the $50 million of COGS inflation for 2018, is that net of any impact from the step up in amortization and in D&A? And then also a change in pension accounting, I think, geographically might take some the $27 million of pension income out of COGS and move it below the operating profit line? So just wanted to understand if that's a net number? And then the question I had was for -- I guess for Mark and Gavin. You know you've seen some more, I guess, investment or more activity in, I guess, the fitness beer category for the lack of a better word with Corona Premier coming and you've got I'm still bringing our product into the market.", "So just kind of your thoughts on that segment as you get more sort of investment behind it, how it interacts with the Premium Light beers and just thoughts around that and how that's evolving would be helpful. Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "Thanks, Bryan. Tracey, do you want to pick up clarification to Bryan's first part?", "Tracey Joubert", "Yes. So the incremental $50 million inflation that I quoted incremental above 2017 inflation as we saw is not just COGS. It's actually COGS and G&A, and it's across all of that business units that is primarily driven by commodity inflation so aluminum and diesel fuel would be the main drivers, but it's across all [indiscernible] MG&A and COGS. Then in terms of the pension changes so what I may be refer you to is our 10-K is actually up on our website now. We've got quite a detailed lay out in tables and expeditious if you want to refer to footnote 1 and footnote 21 in our 10-K, that's detailed the change in methodology. And in footnote two, actually details the changes around the safety accounting standards.", "So Bryan, if you want to have a look at that and maybe come back to us after the call, we can break that down a little bit further for you.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. Thanks, Tracey. And Bryan, just on your second question on this new segment that you invented the fitness beer category, I think I know what you're referring to. The good news is a few years descriptor, we have the original fitness beer we just called Miller Lite. That's what we're doubling down on. We continue to believe that continuing to focus on both Miller Lite and its very clear functional benefits and Coors Light and its very clear lifestyle benefits the best way to respond to interest in what you've described as fitness beer. The other thing that's of interest is quite significant crossover between some of the alcoholic seltzers that have come into the marketplace, and fitness or light beer and it's important that we offer bread across our portfolio. So across Miller Lite and Coors Light, we'll continue to strengthen their equities. We'll compete more assertively with Henry's Hard Sparkling, and we'll have the right products for 2018.", "And then, obviously, some of the metric and imports kind of play into that space as well, and the introduction of Sal becomes very important for us. So we believe that there's more than enough on our plate and we've got to be choice will about ensuring that we deliver real focus behind our portfolio. And against the 2 big light brands, Henry's Hard Sparkling and Sol, we've got the right portfolio to compete effectively and that space if I'm defining it correctly.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.", "Lauren Lieberman", "I wanted to solve on two things; first is just commentary on the commercial effectiveness and efficiency in the fourth quarter, just how much of that is one, can you talk a little bit about distinctive efforts there? And two, things that we're planned versus real more sort of real-time adjustments in the second half of the year as you saw that the industry volumes was soft, that was one area of question. And the second was just dimension of the incremental placement and visibility you have from your distributors. So was that primarily on Sol and the Arnold Palmer? Or is that incremental description of our new placement from some of what I'll call it legacy existing portfolio? Thanks.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. So the second part of your question; Gavin, do you just want to pick up on the success on the placements the teams have been driving as we come into 2018?", "Gavin Hattersley", "Yes, sure. Thanks, Mark. We've got tens of thousands of placements for -- actually hundreds of thousands of placements for our innovation brands. You're rightly called them out as Sol and Arnold Palmer spiked half and half. Easy -- not easy, [indiscernible] which is our entry into the tea category and to try and recruit new drinkers into our economy portfolio, 21 through 24-year olds, which have primarily walked away from beer to hedges actually designed tens of thousands of new placements for that. And yes, we did get more presents for brands like Blue Moon and Coors Light and so on.", "Mark Hunter", "I think you invented a new brand there, Gavin.", "Gavin Hattersley", "I got caught up between Arnold Palmer and Two Hats. Arnold Palmer is the tea and the lightly flavored light beer to recruit new drinkers.", "Mark Hunter", "They're not sharing placements either. They have discrete placements, but I think...", "Gavin Hattersley", "Correct.", "Mark Hunter", "On the first part of your question Laurent, on just commercial effectiveness, I mean, clearly, as we've come through this year, we've worked very hard from a procurement perspective, a global media RFP, which is a very successful, which has allowed us moment to drive efficiency and productivity and some of our marketing dollars. And the simplest way to think about this is really coming to the year with an assumption around investment per hectoliter. When I was business unit CEO in Europe in this role, what we've attempted if we see their softness from a volume perspective because maybe the segment is underperforming overall, and we're trying to maintain our investment on a per hectoliter basis buy that means in totality, that investment may fall so we're still drive the same kind of productivity and impact per hectoliter.", "There is a combination of maintaining that spend per hec, while at the same time also driving productivity through our roaming model so that gives us flexibility in a real-time basis to respond to segment changes, our brand momentum within our business. And hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a flavor.", "Operator", "The final question comes from Mark Swartzberg with Stifel Financial.", "Mark Swartzberg", "Dave, really been a pleasure working with you. So thank you, and Sam, too, thank you. My question, Tracey or Mark, is on the $330 million return of purchase price on the Miller International business, which I think was assigned a value of the $700 million. So in its face, it seems like this proportionally you're getting less to EBITDA, but it might mean that you simply thought you were getting a lot of working capital you didn't get. So I'm just trying to understand what was the basis for the return to the $330 million? Is it more working capital amount of EBITDA? Looking for some more detail there.", "Mark Hunter", "Okay. So let me try to try to keep it uncomplicated. The simplest way to think about this is the $330 million that we negotiated with is really a true-up an overall acquisition price the $12 billion -- $330 million. When we made the agreement to acquire the Miller brand internationally, we were very clear that there was a high-level assumption on the EBITDA. That was quite opaque because the Miller brands were embedded across the SAB business, and it wasn't a discrete business. So we started with an assumption and then said we would -- based on the trailing 12-month EBITDA close then get into purchase price adjustment. We kicked off that process and moved into a negotiation with ABI, and we feel that the true-up on overall acquisition price makes sense for us if you then look at the overall multiple we paid with the EBITDA stream. The good news is that the Miller brands are now fully adopted and integrated within our business and performing well with, I think, significant runway ahead of them in Canada and in Europe. And within International business, they're growing very, very strongly.", "So if you also recall, Mark, one of the things that we pointed out was based on the assumption of the trailing 12-month EBITDA. Our business model, particularly for the International business, would be different because we would be sharing that margin with our partners and our distributors. So it was never going to be apples for apples. But in headline terms, just look on this as a true-up on acquisition cost. It's now dropped to less than $11.7 million. And if you look at the overall multiple we paid for the EBITDA we acquired then feeling very good about the outcome of that negotiation.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mark Hunter for any closing remarks.", "Mark Hunter", "Yes, many thanks for facilitating things today. Many thanks for your interest in the Molson Coors Brewing Company. We look forward to catching up with you in our next call and obviously, our Investor and Analyst Meeting we'll be having in New York in June of this year.
