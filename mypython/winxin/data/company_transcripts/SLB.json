(NYSE:SLB) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 21, 2017  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Simon Farrant \u2013 Vice President-Investor Relations", "Simon Ayat \u2013 Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Patrick Schorn \u2013 President, Operations", "Paal Kibsgaard \u2013 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "James West \u2013 Evercore ISI", "Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS", "Ole Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Bill Herbert \u2013 Simmons", "David Anderson \u2013 Barclays", "Jim Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC", "Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you. Hello, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2017 Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Simon Ayat and Patrick Schorn. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we\u2019ll open up for questions. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we\u2019ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.", "I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website.", "With that, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat, who will present the first quarter corporate results and also review the results by group.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.25. This represent a decrease of $0.02 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the current quarter, we recorded $0.05 of Cameron merger and integration charges. Our first quarter revenue of $6.9 billion decreased 3% sequentially, largely driven by the Cameron Group as a result of project completions and reduced product sales.", "Pretax operating margin only decreased by 42 basis points to 11%. Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 3% sequentially, primarily due to project completions in Testing & Process systems and seasonally lower SIS software and multiclient license sales. These decreases were offset in part by progress on early production facility projects in the Middle East and the improved Wireline revenue in North America.", "Margin decreased 170 basis points to 17%, driven by the lower contribution from SIS software and multiclient sales. Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, while margins were sequentially flat at 11.5%. Strong activity in North America was offset by lower activity and pricing pressure internationally across the group. Production Group revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 1% sequentially, and margins fell by 78 basis points to 5%. These results were primarily driven by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in North America land, which was offset by seasonally lower completion product sales and lower SPM revenue.", "The Cameron Group revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 9% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by OneSubsea as a result of declining project volumes. Reduced product sales in Surface System and the further drop in Drilling System also contributed to the decline. Margins decreased 80 basis points to 13%. Despite the revenue decline, OneSubsea margins still exceeded 20% for the third straight quarter as a result of strong project execution. While the drilling backlog was essentially flat, the OneSubsea backlog increase largely reflected the Mad Dog 2 award. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses increased to 1.1 in the first quarter. This marks the first time these businesses have been above 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 15.3% in the first quarter compared to 15.8% in the previous quarter. Looking forward, the ETR will be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. With the continued recovery in North America, we anticipate that the ETR will increase next quarter and over the course of the year. We generated $656 million of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation as well as the payment of $140 million in severance during the quarter. We also continue to experience payment delays from certain customers, primarily in North \u2013 in Latin America.", "Our net debt increased $1.3 billion during the quarter to $11.4 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $7.6 billion. During the quarter, we spend $372 million to repurchase 4.7 million shares at an average price of $78.97. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included roughly $380 million on CapEx and the investments of approximately $145 million in SPM projects and $115 million in multiclient. During the quarter, we also made $696 million of dividend payments and $221 million in Borr Drilling. Full year 2017 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.", "And now I will turn the conference over to Patrick.", "Patrick Schorn", "Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Starting off with North America. Our first quarter revenue increased 6% sequentially as growth in U.S. land and Western Canada was partially offset by further activity reductions in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada. As expected, the North America land market continued to strengthen during the first quarter in terms of both activity and pricing, leading us to start full-scale deployment of idle capacity for most product lines.", "Revenue growth was led by hydraulic fracturing and drilling services, but also increasingly supported by Artificial Lift, Surface Systems and Valves & Measurements. In spite of our capacity reactivation being heavily back-end loaded as we continue to adhere to our profitable growth strategy, we still generated 16% sequential revenue growth in our hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling services in U.S. land. And even more importantly, we delivered incremental margins of 66% for these services combined in U.S. land, driven by productive customer engagements around pricing recovery and operational efficiency, together with timely resource additions, new technology sales and proactive supply chain management.", "In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the first quarter revenue declined again sequentially as the deepwater rig count dropped 15 at the end of March, which represents a reduction of 74% compared to the peak activity level of 2014. In addition to the low drilling activity, we also saw a further sequential drop in seismic multiclient sales, leaving offshore revenues at unprecedented low levels. In parallel with these record low level activity, product and services pricing, as in several recent cases, fall into levels that make it impossible for us to uphold our operating standards and, at the same time, turn a profit in this extremely challenging operating environment. We are therefore in the process of redeploying both service capacity and technical support resources from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico to other more viable markets.", "Internationally, the first quarter revenue fell 7% sequentially, driven by stronger-than-expected seasonal decline in activity and product sales in particularly in the North Sea, Russia land and China and also by lower sequential activity in key parts of the Middle East. On a positive note, revenues in Latin America were flat sequentially, confirming that this region has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. The results were driven by solid activity in Brazil, further supported by multiclient seismic sales and strong OneSubsea and Cameron Drilling Systems activity. This was offset by a range of activity challenges impacting our hydraulic fracturing operations in Argentina, which has now been resolved, as well as production constraints imposed on our Shushufindi SPM project in Ecuador.", "Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa decreased 10% sequentially, driven primarily by the completion of a large OneSubsea project, lower Cameron Surface Systems sales, reduced SIS software license sales and a more severe seasonal reduction in drilling-related activity throughout Russia, Kazakhstan and the North Sea. Still, the activity in the Northern parts of ECA is expected to recover in the second quarter, and we maintain a constructive outlook for the year for both Russia and the North Sea. In Africa, revenue was flat sequentially, which clearly indicates that this region has also reached the bottom of the cycle. In North Africa, activity remained stable in Algeria during the first quarter, and we also started preparations for reentering Libya and expect to start a small-scale land operation in the second quarter after having been shut down on land for the past 3 years.", "Sub-Sahara Africa revenue was also flat sequentially as early termination of ongoing drilling activity in Angola and Gabon was offset by the start-up of 2 new deepwater projects in Congo and Senegal as well as by strong growth in land activity in Chad, Congo and Ethiopia. In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 7% sequentially, driven by lower product sales from the Cameron Surface and Drilling Systems product lines and also by lower activity and service pricing pressures throughout the Middle East, particularly impacting the Production Group.", "In Asia, revenues in China and Australia were lower sequentially due to lower offshore drilling activity and by severe seasonal weather impacting our land operation in both countries. And finally, the first quarter revenue in Malaysia and Indonesia, flat sequentially, confirming that we have reached the bottom of the cycle also here but with no clear signs yet of any significant activity recovery in this region.", "With that, I will hand the call over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Patrick. Following the review of our first quarter results from Simon and Patrick, I will next provide you with an updated business outlook. But before I do that, I would like to say a few words about the Cameron Group as we just passed the 1-year mark since the closing of the transaction. Over the past 12 months, we have successfully implemented the first phase of our integration plan, which included 3 main themes: first, the colocation of 1,700 employees into joint facilities around the world; second, combining Schlumberger and Cameron businesses to deliver enhanced offerings to our customers, such as our new Testing & Process systems product line; and third, bringing together Cameron and Schlumberger technologies, for instance, in hydraulic fracturing and in OneDrill and by launching as many as 32 integrated R&D projects to further expand our integrated technology offering. At the same time, OneSubsea, which is now in its fifth year of existence, has firmly established a leadership position in the subsea market through the pore-to-pipeline approach, as seen by the higher rate of project awards in recent quarters as well as their industry-leading operating margins.", "Overall, the entire Cameron integration program has exceeded the ambitious first year of synergy target we set and delivered approximately $400 million in operating income synergies as well as $600 million in new orders. The first quarter results from the Cameron Group were, again, very solid. And I would like to complement the entire Cameron organization and the integration team on a job well done, where they have jointly ensured that the largest transaction Schlumberger has done to date has turned out to be a great success.", "Turning next to the business outlook. We maintain our constructive view of the oil market, and we made further inventory growth in the second quarter, driven by the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts put in place in January.", "At present, the region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, although investment levels in the Middle East and Russia are also expected to remain resilient this year. However, for the rest of the world, which still make up more than 50 million barrels per day of oil production, we are heading towards a third year of significant underinvestment, which increases the likelihood of a medium-term supply deficit as produced reserves are not replaced in sufficient volume.", "In particular, the market continues to focus on headline decline numbers that suggest that production is holding up well, while a closer examination of the underlying data clearly shows that the rate of depletion of proved undeveloped reserves is rapidly accelerating in several key non-OPEC countries.", "The current level of underinvestments is most visible in exploration, where the record-low investments, including both drilling and seismic, led to a total amount of industry discoveries of less than 5 billion barrels in 2016 versus a produced volume of over 30 billion barrels, dropping the industry-wide reserves-to-replacement ratio to 32%.", "Still at present, there is no clear sign of any general increase in exploration spend, with the one exception being Mexico, where we are seeing an increasing interest in the offshore multiclient surveys we have acquired over the past two years.", "Looking next at our business outlook by region. The recovery will clearly be led by North America land, where investment levels are expected to increase by 50% in 2017, leading to a strong increase in activity and an overdue correction to service and product pricing.", "Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business in recent years, we are very well set up to take a leading position in serving our customers in the coming growth cycle.", "In drilling, we have built a market-leading position by expanding our offering through the Smith and M-I SWACO acquisitions and through a broad organic R&D program targeting the North America land market. As drilling complexity continues to increase with even longer laterals, our purpose design technologies are starting to have a significant impact on our customers\u2019 drilling performance. One example of this is the strong uptake of our AxeBlade drillbit, which by itself has demonstrated a record 35% increase in rate of penetration for Matador in the Permian.", "Furthermore, our PowerDrive Orbit rotary steerable technology continues to be sold out for a third successive quarter and in an 80-well campaign for Parsley Energy in the Midland and Delaware basins. This technology contributed to a 17% reduction in the average drilling time per well and a 30% reduction in the drilling cost per lateral foot.", "Both of these examples show the performance potential new technologies hold in the North America land market and demonstrate the growth opportunities for our drilling offering as we continue to prepare for the introduction of our OneDrill platform in the second half of this year. We are also starting to see strong growth momentum in North America land for our market-leading Artificial Lift offering, where we recently also acquired a 49.9% stake in the HEAL technology from Production Plus Energy Services based in Calgary.", "HEAL, which can be used in wells together with our ESP plunger lift and rod lift offering, reduces fluid slugging, depresses form generation, contains solid and separates gas, which altogether improves production and reduces the need for workovers. We are presently at the introduction stage of this exciting new technology, which, over the first 140 installations, have delivered an average production increase of 45%.", "Within our hydraulic fracturing and completions offering, we have also made significant investments in recent years, including the development of a fully automated surface delivery system and also by acquiring our own sand mines and the associated vertically integrated distribution system, which will greatly improve our full-cycle returns.", "In terms of well productivity, the market offtake of our geoengineered completions continues to grow, and the offering is delivering significant value for our customers, as seen by the 18-well program we recently completed for Lonestar Resources in the Eagle Ford Shale.", "Here, we optimize drilling, stimulation and completion plans across the long laterals, supported by our drillbit formation BroadBand Sequence diversion technology. As a result, the wells produced up to 86% more hydrocarbon per 1,000 feet of lateral compared to offset wells in two other fields.", "With proppant prices and distribution costs now starting to rapidly increase, we are also expecting to see a recovery in the use of our HiWAY technology, which reduces proppant use by 40% and water use by 25%.", "Building on this broad technology platform, the pending OneStim JV with Weatherford will give us the required scale in terms of both hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions technologies to drive efficiency and market penetration in all the unconventional basins in North America land.", "At this stage, the regulatory filings have been completed. And as we await the required approvals to close the OneStim transaction, the integration teams are making all the necessary preparations for a successful day 1 of the new company.", "Looking next at Latin America. The flat sequential revenue in the first quarter was a long-awaited positive confirmation that this market has indeed reached the bottom of the cycle. Going forward, there are emerging positive signs for our business in the region, including opportunities for new commercial models in Brazil as Petrobras continues its assets divestment program and as a new focus is brought to mature land basins.", "In Argentina, new plans to bring stability to natural gas prices should lead to higher investment levels. And we are also excited about our recent agreement with YPF for a joint development in the Vaca Muerta Shale.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, we see strengthening activity in the North Sea, Russia and the Caspian region in the coming quarters as the winter season ends and new projects start up. In Africa, we expect some activity improvement in the North as we start up a small-scale land operation in Libya after being shut down for the past three years. While we see a slow but steady improvement in Sub-Saharan Africa over the coming quarters, driven by a mix of land activity in Chad, Congo and Ethiopia and a limited number of deepwater start-ups in Congo, Guinea and the Ivory Coast.", "In the Middle East, activity will continue to be driven by the GCC countries. However, we do not expect significant sequential growth from this region over the coming quarters. While in Asia, we will see the normal seasonal recovery in China. Overall, it\u2019s clear that activity in the international market has reached bottom in all regions. But even though we see positive signs in many countries, we expect only moderate sequential activity growth in the coming quarters.", "This slower recovery, lingering pricing pressure, means that we will likely face another challenging year in the international markets while we expect an acceleration of the activity growth towards the back end of 2017 and into 2018.", "With this market backdrop, we continue to actively position Schlumberger at the forefront of an industry that needs to evolve. We do this by proactively managing our base business and responding to ongoing pressures of commoditization by tailoring our offering, resources and service performance to changing market conditions.", "In parallel, we constantly look to expand our opportunity set in a period where the industry, in many ways, lacks overall direction. This includes driving a broad and very active M&A program, engaging with existing and new customers to establish closer collaboration and more aligned business models and also expanding our offering from technical support to now also taking a financial position alongside our customers in applicable projects, all with the aim of generating more activity for our 19 product lines.", "As we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready and able to think new and to act new.", "Thank you. With that, we will open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "James West", "Hey good afternoon, Paal", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good afternoon. So given that you guys are holding your call from the Kingdom, the board meeting was held in the Kingdom as well, I\u2019d love to hear kind of what \u2013 as you and the board talk about strategic focus over the next several quarters but also several years and talk about the implementation of those strategies, what are the key kind of top 1, 2, 3 items that you or that Schlumberger is most focused on in the near-term and especially given your broad international focus? And I think we understand where you stand in North America.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you are asking about in particular in Saudi Arabia, let me first say that the board has spent actually a full week in Saudi Arabia, in between Jeddah, Riyadh, Shaybah and Dhahran. We have visited the KAUST University, a range of government institutions focused on science, technology and innovation. And of course, we spent a lot of time with our largest customer, Saudi Aramco, both at their headquarters in Dhahran and then in their field operations in the South in Shaybah.", "Now the board had a particular interest in broadening its understanding of both the Vision 2030 for the country as well as the In-Kingdom Total Value Add program, which is also very important, and in particular, how Schlumberger continues to actively support these programs and also how we further strengthen our position in the kingdom. Now as part of our visit, we also have the privilege of meeting His Excellency, Khalid Al-Falih, to discuss the state of the oil market, which was also very useful for our board to do.", "Now everywhere we went, we had been met by exceptional hospitality, and the board was actually very impressed with everything that we saw and everything that is going on in the kingdom. So this has really served as a further extension of our understanding of all the details that was going on in the country, and that is helping both the board and the senior management team, which was also here to further adjust and, I would say, accelerate our plans of investment in the country.", "James West", "Okay, that\u2019s great. It\u2019s very helpful, Paal. And maybe just a quick follow-up for me. You recently announced the new special venture fund, and you made some very quick moves there with that fund. Could you perhaps elaborate a little bit on the mandate here for the fund and what you see as the opportunity set?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So just to be clear on what the fund is, so this is a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers. And this is basically to enable closer collaboration and alignment with our customers. It is also there to facilitate and support additional E&P investments and also for us, very importantly, to secure preferred supplier agreements for our products and services for whatever these investments that we facilitate. So this is the overall driver behind it.", "Now we understand that many of our customers do not see a need for this, but some customers do, and the key principle for us that this fund and these investment opportunities is open to all customers. So the basic thing here is that it\u2019s simply aiming to enable growth and in the base business.", "Now the scope of the fund, again, is relatively open. We will evaluate each project based on its stand-alone merits. We haven\u2019t, at this stage, set the limits for the size of the fund. But I think importantly as well, they are also open to possibly co-invest with third parties. And obviously, the fund will be subject to the same, I would say, governance and risk management processes that we have for the base business, and ultimately, all the investment decisions will be approved by our CFO. So it\u2019s something that is in place to facilitate further growth for the base business. I think that\u2019s the best summary of it.", "James West", "Okay, great. Thanks, Paul.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, James.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon, guys as well.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Angie Sedita", "So Paal, so could we go back to the U.S. a little bit? And obviously, the OneStim is a surprising JV and interesting to see. So can you talk a little bit about your strategy there as far as redeploying the frac fleet into the U.S. market and if you could even have a target horsepower as you exit 2017 and maybe a little bit about the logistics of the JV?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I think we need to separate the JV from our current hydraulic fracturing business in North America land. The JV will obviously include all that business when it\u2019s closed. But as of now, we continue to manage our business in a stand-alone fashion while we are preparing obviously to close the JV as soon as possible.", "So I will comment briefly on our plans for activation of capacity for the base business today, and I\u2019ll have Patrick give a few comments around the OneStim JV and the plans post-closure. So if you look at the situation today on our fracking business, we\u2019ve always said that as soon as we have a clear pathway towards profitability, we will start actively reactivating our idle capacity.", "This point in time \u2013 actually past in the first quarter, so towards the back end of the first quarter, we actually started actively reactivating our idle capacity. And this process is going to accelerate in the second quarter and also going into H2. So based on the current plan we have at this stage, we plan to have our entire idle capacity from the Schlumberger side deployed during the fourth quarter of this year.", "So this is the current plan of reactivation. We are getting, I would say, significant traction on pricing. We are actively hiring people both for the wellsite operations and for the vertical integration part, including the transportation side of things as well. And I think the balance we have between the insourcing of our vertical supply chain, together with still a very close working relationship with our suppliers \u2013 and just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate. We will have a certain amount of our capacity vertically integrated, and we will continue also to work closely with our suppliers, both on the sand mine side as well as transportation and distribution.", "So we will continue now in the coming quarters to actively redeploy. And obviously, when we close the OneStim JV, these resources and these businesses will all be combined in OneStim, which will then just continue on the same process. So Patrick, you want to say a few words about where we stand on OneStim and plans?", "Patrick Schorn", "Sure. Regarding the OneStim joint venture, which is a 70-30 joint venture with Weatherford for North America land for hydraulic fracturing and completion, it really creates a new industry leader in terms of hydraulic horsepower and multistage completions. Through its scale, it will offer a cost-effective and competitive service delivery platform, which is clearly positioned to provide customers with leading operational efficiency and best-in-class hydraulic fracturing and completion technologies.", "Importantly, reliable equipment availability for our customers, and it will also improve significantly the full-cycle shareholder returns from this particular market. So in this case, Weatherford is contributing its leading multistage completions portfolio, around 1 million horsepower in pumping equipment and the pump down perforating business. And what we will end up with is a very capital-efficient structure, pulling the hydraulic horsepower to gain economies of scale, which clearly is very much from the current market recovery. I\u2019ll leave it with that.", "Angie Sedita", "Okay, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful color. So as a unrelated follow-up. Maybe you can give a little bit of color on Cameron and what your outlook is for subsea overall as far as large projects and pricing and even the rig of the future, any update there.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Patrick, do you want to cover that?", "Patrick Schorn", "Sure. So firstly, we exceeded our first year synergy targets, and we realized approximately $400 million in savings there. And we already secured around $600 million in new synergy orders. So from that perspective, the transaction is working well, and the integration is going extremely well. So what we are focused on in Cameron is really creating a fully integrated drilling and production system, combining our leading well and subsurface offering with Cameron\u2019s leading service technology, further leveraging instrumentation and software control and optimization capabilities.", "During Q1, overall the revenue was seasonally down, driven mainly by OneSubsea and Surface Systems as Surface and V&M posted double [indiscernible] in U.S. land and a step change in bookings. And that is maybe the most important, as was already mentioned by Simon as well, where we are starting to see that the book to bill is starting to go over 1. The margin decline somewhat, but through strong execution and cost control, we limited the margin decline to approximately 88 basis points.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "All right. Next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer", "Thank you very much. I\u2019m wondering, Paal or Simon, whether you could elaborate a little bit on the increased participation in customer projects under SPM. You highlighted in the prepared remarks that payments from certain Latin American customers have slowed down. And \u2013 how do you see the evolution, the impact on return on capital, how big really the committed capital become? I think that\u2019s a line of questioning I think, I guess, in every single investor meeting when the topic of Schlumberger comes up.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I\u2019ll say, going back to what I mentioned about the fund, Ole, the fund itself is there to facilitate growth in the base business. So the way we look at the fund is that if we do make investments alongside our customers, these investments will need to meet the return criteria that we have overall as a company and also the base business that we get associated with the project. Through preferred supplier agreements, we\u2019d also obviously need to meet the same return criteria.", "So I think the way to look at the fund is that we have a strong balance sheet. We have strong cash flow, and we have a fair bit of cash on hand. And what we are doing on a selective basis is looking for investment opportunities to facilitate more base business for the company. Our revenues are still at around 50% of what they were eight, nine quarters ago. And we are trying very actively to make sure that we can get baseline growth not just in North America land, but also globally.", "And given the capability set we have as a company, in particular around subsurface understanding and drilling and completions, we see this as a very good way of a thing to drive, I would say, short and medium-term activity. But very importantly, these contracts that we enter into here could have durations of 10 to 15 to 20 years, which will also provide us with a very good baseline of activity and earnings throughout the coming cycles as well.", "So I don\u2019t think there should be a huge reason for concern around the capital intensity. We have capital available to invest, and we are trying to invest this wisely into projects that have good returns stand-alone but also that facilitates growth opportunities for the base business.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay, thank you. And on the revenue synergies with Cameron, $600 million, it\u2019s very difficult for us to see what would that come to with or without the joint venture. So can you elaborate a little bit about what type of business is it that you\u2019ve signed up that you don\u2019t think either Schlumberger or Cameron would have achieved on a stand-alone basis? And maybe the context of that, also comment a little bit on your rationale between \u2013 by investing in \u2013 it will have in Borr?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Patrick, why don\u2019t you talk about Cameron? I\u2019ll cover Borr when you\u2019re done with that.", "Patrick Schorn", "All right. So talking about some of the examples of revenue synergies, I think one of the \u2013 your previous one is clearly the expanding of Cameron\u2019s geographical reach and using as such the Schlumberger existing footprint to reach a far larger customer base. What it also helps with is accelerating the implementation of the OneSubsea vision and plans as the cooperation between the companies is much closer today.", "And the \u2013 one of the first points we had brought up when we started talking about the opportunities was addressing the significant industry NPT issues related to BOPs. And here, you have to really think about monitoring and how we could optimize the use in that side. And then where we really focus, and this might link into what you \u2013 what we have discussed in the past when it comes to issues like rig of the future is creating a integrated drilling system, which would include all the service and service components that we offer, and obviously then optimize the drilling process to such an extent that neither one of the single companies could achieve. That is really the main examples of revenue synergies.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Thanks, Patrick. So Ole, let me just comment quickly on Borr then. So \u2013 and as you\u2019ve seen, we made a $221 million investment to take a 20% stake in this new company. There are several drivers behind the investment, but the main driver is really to create a platform where we can collaborate closely with Borr to offer performance drilling offshore in shallow water. We see this as, I think, a significant opportunity for Schlumberger and also for Borr to offer this new type of contract model, which is now heavily used on land but also now to be used in shallow water. Just for the record, we are also open to work with other and offer drillers on the similar type of performance contracts.", "Now back to Borr, Borr also represents a significant potential market for Cameron drilling, both in terms of BOP, sand and drilling packages. And I would say lastly, looking at the company and the plans going forward, we also expect this to be a very good financial investment. So this is the main rationale behind investment.", "Ole Slorer", "Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Ole.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert", "Thanks. Good morning. A question with regard to the incrementals that you generated in Lower 48 for frac and directional 66%, I think, for Q1. Patrick and Paal, just given the reactivation slate that you have in front of you, which is \u2013 seems to be pretty large, do you expect to generate either that level of profit improvement over the course of this year or something within that neighborhood as you reactivate assets? The rest of the industry seems to have difficulty with regard to revenue growth and converging that with profit improvement that hasn\u2019t happened. But in your case, it looks like the profit improvement was actually fairly considerable. And I\u2019m just curious as to the relationship between reactivation growth and margin improvement in light of that.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "That\u2019s a good question. So I would kind of split it into 2. When it comes to the onetime cost of reactivating, yes, we will have some impact of that in the coming quarters. I would say the \u2013 but the underlying incrementals that we\u2019re aiming for is going to be around this level. But we will be subject to some additional activation costs, I would say in the \u2013 probably in the second and the third quarter, which might, for those 2 quarters, basically deliver slightly lower incrementals overall. But the underlying, I would say, drive we have between getting customer price increases and driving efficiency through scale as we reactivate and also managing our supply chain, underlying, we are aiming for those type of incrementals, which we have talked about for the company for the past couple of years. We will have some headwinds around onetime reactivation costs in the coming quarters. But beyond that, we are looking to manage at this level.", "Bill Herbert", "Oka, thank you. And then secondly, with regard to Shushufindi and I guess the challenges that were reported in the media in recent weeks with regard to Ecuador, can you update us with regard to what the forward path on that project looks like?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I can. And first of all, let me just clarify that we have several SPM projects in Ecuador.", "Bill Herbert", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "And the issues we are discussing are only pertaining to Shushufindi, right?", "Bill Herbert", "Okay.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Now just to give you some background on Shushufindi, we are now in the fifth successful year of operations there. And in between the Shushufindi Consortium, which we lead, and Petroamazonas, the state oil company, we have a very solid governance model, and we have annual budgets and annual production targets, which are set and agreed. And if you go back for these 5 years, we have exceeded all these production targets. But what has happened is that with the lower oil price, this has led to cash flow challenges for Petroamazonas. And they are also selling the oil that we produce from the Shushufindi field. So they are basically then falling behind on our payments, and this is really the key issue.", "So the proposal they have made to address the payment issues is not acceptable, and the situation over the first quarter has been further aggravated by the fact that they have imposed also production constraints on the outputs from the Shushufindi field. So bottom line, we find this treatment of a partner, who has made significant investments in the country, somewhat disappointing. But still, we are very confident that the issues are going to be resolved, either amicably by \u2013 or by using the dispute resolution provisions that are in the contract. So that\u2019s kind of where we are. How long it\u2019s going to take to get it resolved, I can\u2019t say at this stage. But we are ready to sit down again and continue discussions, and there have been a number of meetings and discussions over the past couple of months. We are ready to continue these discussions as soon as the imposed production constraints are lifted.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "DavidAnderson", "Thanks. Paal, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the weakness in the Middle East you saw this quarter. It was mentioned a few times in the release, and I guess the pricing pressure wasn\u2019t a huge surprise. But the activity reduction did stand out to me. I was just wondering, is there a specific country that\u2019s experiencing this? And do you think this comes back later in the year? Or is it more of an adjustment to the drilling programs? I just wondered if you could just provide a little bit more color on the GCCs.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So I wouldn\u2019t use the word weakness, David. I think the \u2013 we have a slight decline in overall activity and revenue in the Middle East. Obviously all declines in Asia that weighs in on the overall EMEA numbers. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that concerns or so worries us that should concern or worry you. But we are not seeing any significant growth in the coming quarters. We are slightly down, like I said, sequentially [indiscernible]. This is more around, I would say, project mix\u2026", "David Anderson", "Okay.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "\u2026priorities and so forth, right? So I would say the underlying business in the Middle East is very resilient. There are strong and clear plans in each of the countries we operate here. And so no major worries. It\u2019s just that there is no, I would say, significant steady sequential growth either in Q1 or in the coming quarters, just a very steady resilient base business.", "David Anderson", "Okay, thanks. And just a follow-up would be on the offshore side. Seems like IOC just doesn\u2019t seem eager to invest offshore. We haven\u2019t really seen much on the step-out and tieback front. I was just wondering if you could maybe elaborate. We talked in the past about maybe 5 to 8 big projects potentially being announced in the back part of the year. Has your views on kind of offshore kind of shifted a little bit? I was just wondering if you could help us, kind of what is the road map you think to recovery in offshore? Is this kind of, again, pushed out maybe more to an 2018 event when we start seeing some of these projects awarded.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, we see the same as you. And so there hasn\u2019t \u2013 so far of significant FIDs, plans being discussed of the things going on offshore. We \u2013 if you look at jack-up utilization, I think there is a slight uptick on it. So I think there\u2019s probably some early signs that we\u2019ll get some light work coming our way as an industry in the next couple of quarters. But in terms of bigger projects, I agree with you, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. So I think the main thing here is, I think for the IOC customers to basically get a better medium-term view on oil prices, and obviously, the positive uptick we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of quarters is a good thing.", "But I would assume that I\u2019m also looking for what the floor could be and maybe awaiting potentially what OPEC is going to do as we go into the May \u2013 the late May meeting around whether they extend the production cuts or not. So I agree with you. I think the increase in offshore activity or shallow water activity is probably more going to be a second half of the year event, leading into 2018. So with that, though, it\u2019s still very important for us as a company to at least secure the work that is coming out of projects that are being FID-ed. And that\u2019s why we are very happy and excited, the fact that we landed the Mad Dog 2 project, for instance.", "David Anderson", "Great. Thank you, Paul.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Jim Wicklund", "Good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Jim", "Jim Wicklund", "A lot of questions asked, so if I could drill down a little bit on North America. Patrick, you made comments about the increased vertical participation in sand and additional sand mines. Can you tell us what you guys have done here in the last couple of quarters in terms of assuring capacity, delivery and making a little extra money, I guess, too, in North America in sand?", "Patrick Schorn", "Yes, I\u2019ll cover that, Jim. So what we have done, we basically started this vertical integration investment program towards the back end of 2014. And we have made a number of investments in sand mines, which are now starting to come on production. And in addition to that, we obviously also invested further into owning railcars, owning transloading facilities. And we also are now \u2013 we have established our own trucking fleet, where we are now hiring people into manning the trucks that we have bought and that we are currently buying. So \u2013 but just to be clear, we are not looking to fully vertically integrate.", "We will have a certain amount of our capacity in it. We will do a fair bit of it, but we are still going to rely on the long-term suppliers that we\u2019ve had both in upturn as well as in the \u2013 in future downturns. But we see the investments that we make into this, with the rapid cost inflations that you typically see starting at this part of the cycle, as a very good investment and a way to insulate ourselves from the massive supply chain inflation that we saw in the previous cycle, right? So it\u2019s going to be a balancing between vertical integration, 100% owned by us, as well as using the supply chain capabilities that we have in the open market.", "Jim Wicklund", "Okay. And my follow-up in kind of the same vein, you talk about the completion capacity and what it would brings in OneStim. I know that 80% of the completions that we do in the U.S., 80% plus what \u2013 are plug-and-perf. And sliding sleeves, this has been marginalized. I know that Weatherford does both plug-and-perf and sliding sleeves. What is Schlumberger\u2019s view of how those 2 technologies are going to develop? And is everything going to be plugged and parked in a couple of years? Or can you talk about where that technology is going to go? We don\u2019t really know a whole lot of details about the breakdown of Weatherford stations both, frankly, and yours in that regard. So if you could give us some guidance on where the market is headed, that would be appreciated.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Well, I think first of all, the multistage completion offering that Weatherford brings into the JV and also combined with ours will have a complete range of both open-hole and cased-hole solutions. Now if you look at where the market has been heading, I would say in the last 3, 4, 5 years, it has been gradually moving more and more to plug-and-perf with less, I would say, open-hole completions and sliding sleeves. There\u2019s still more of that type of completions in Canada compared to what you have in U.S. land.", "So I would say that we are basically set up for \u2013 if the market continues the current trend towards more plug-and-perf in cased hole or whether there is a reemergence of the open hole, right? So I think we have a very good balance, and we can go either way. I think it\u2019s going to come down to well performance productivity and completion costs in terms of what\u2019s going to govern this, but we are adjusted well in either way, Jim.", "Jim Wicklund", "Okay. Thank you guys very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "Hey, good afternoon. Where you are?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you very much.", "Kurt Hallead", "Great. Awesome information flow so far. So I figured I\u2019d kind of get right to the crux of probably what a lot of people are trying to gauge from all this great information, is how do you feel about the progression on The Street numbers as we look out into the second quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, there \u2013 and there, the question came. That\u2019s good. Well, I would say that in the second quarter, first of all, at the high level, we are expecting to see a continuation of the main trends that we saw in the first quarter. And then if you break our North America and international, for North America, we expect solid top line growth in Q3. And this is going to be driven, again, by what we saw in Q1 as well: further growth in the rig activity; for us, additional pricing and market share gains in directional drilling; and also, as we talked about earlier on the call, an acceleration of the capacity reactivation in fracking.", "Now underlying incremental margins, as I commented on earlier, should be solid. But in Q2 and probably Q3 as well, they\u2019re going to be partly offset by some of these onetime start-up costs that we are having. And also, in the second quarter, we are as usual also footing the cost of the Canadian breakup. But overall, I would say strong top line growth and decent earnings growth for us in North America in the second quarter, with some small headwinds around the start-up costs.", "Internationally, as I said earlier, we have reached bottom in all markets. But for the second quarter, we only see, at this stage, flat underlying activity in Q2. So the \u2013 really, the only growth that we are going to see in the second quarter is going to be limited to the seasonal recovery in the North Sea, Russia and China.", "Now on the Cameron side, revenue is also expected to be more or less flat, where we are seeing solid growth in the short-cycle businesses of surface and V&M. But this is going to be offset by the slowing decline now in the long-cycle businesses of OneSubsea and drilling. So if you combine all of these, I believe that a sequential EPS growth of around 15% to 20% between Q1 and Q2 is a reasonable expectation.", "Kurt Hallead", "Great, that\u2019s fantastic. Now based on your commentary about pricing pressures in the international market, and \u2013 it sounded like recovery still at hand in the second half of the year internationally than it would \u2013 I guess we can assume that the first quarter is going to be the low point for earnings of the year, and then you get sequential growth throughout the year. Is that kind of how you see it setting up?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. In principle, yes. I would say, like I said, the underlying activity internationally, Q2 isn\u2019t showing any great signs of improving. But we will have at least the seasonal recovery in some of the key markets to help us. In terms of the pricing, we are still seeing continued pricing pressure on new tenders, but at the same time, some of this, we are looking to offset by exiting our unsustainable contracts. We still have some of these contracts that we are looking to resolve either by shutting the contract down or by getting the pricing increases that we need in order to make this a viable business proposition for us.", "So yes, I would say in principle, the Q1 should be the low end of earnings for the year in international market, with still only limited growth in Q2 but more of an acceleration in the second half of the year.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then maybe quick follow-up here just on your commentary about the investing alongside your customers in the YPF deal and Borr Drilling and so on. So Paal, you guys have indicated in the past that all your SPM investments have effectively been margin and returns accretive in aggregate compared to the corporate average. As you\u2019re making more and more investments in the year, like, what is the criteria, right? How should we think about it? If you\u2019re going to invest, say, $200 million in Borr Drilling, how do we think about that in terms of incremental revenue or incremental profitability? Could you give us just some general gauge on how to assess that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, the investments in the equity of Borr Drilling should bring a return on investment or capital employed, which is accretive to the company. That\u2019s why we made the company \u2013 that\u2019s why we made the investments. And for future investments, that\u2019s, again, what we are going to look for when we spend cash on this type of investments. Hand in hand with that is also obviously the revenue opportunity that this brings. And with this, like I said, we\u2019re going to focus in on two things. With that big fleet of jack-ups, this is a very good market potential for Cameron drilling, but even more importantly, what we are really driving at here is to introduce performance drilling in the offshore markets. So this is just one example. But when we make these investments, there will be synergies and business opportunities and revenue opportunities associated with them. The investments will stand on their own 2 feet, and we aim for them to be accretive to our return on capital employed for the company. But they all need to be associated with the business opportunities for the rest of the company.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay, that\u2019s great. I appreciate that color. Thank you so much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Waqar Syed", "Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to Cameron, some of the recent projects that you\u2019ve entered into, Mad Dog and others. How should we look \u2013 think about long-term margins for these new projects versus what OneSubsea has been generating before?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, obviously, if you look at the commercial environment at this stage versus the commercial environment three years ago when the project that we are currently executing were bid, it\u2019s obviously more challenging. So to think that we can, I would say, achieve the exactly same margins on these latest projects that we are currently delivering on OneSubsea, that might be challenging. But I would say for all the bids that we are making and the contracts that we ultimately secure, we have very clear return expectations on them, somewhat lower than what OneSubsea is currently operating at.", "But we are still looking for this to be a very good business for us going forward, and continuous improvement \u2013 for instance, OneSubsea is showing and the plans they have in place going forward as well to even further improve the way they execute projects. There should also be opportunities for the projects we bid and secure at this phase to have potentially margin upsides as we go forward. So it\u2019s a tough business, but I would say I\u2019m very pleased with how OneSubsea is navigating the commercial environment and also executing and delivering on the projects that we take on.", "Waqar Syed", "And then just my follow-up question on integration-related expenses. When do you think you\u2019re going to stop reporting those?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we \u2013 as we said earlier, we will continue to be reporting them, announcing them separately for the year. But starting next year, we will drop this. This is normally our style. For the first year after the acquisition, we continue to incur them and announce them. And from there on, they become part of our ongoing run rate of cost.", "Waqar Syed", "Thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Waqar. So just before we close this morning, I\u2019d like to summarize the three most important points that we\u2019ve discussed. First, the only region in the world showing clear signs of increased E&P investments in 2017 is North America land, where activity has been growing for the last few quarters. And in line with our profitable growth strategy, we have begun redeploying our idle capacity in pressure pumping, and we will accelerate this in the second quarter. Through the organic and inorganic investments we had made in our North America land business over the past seven years, we are very well positioned to take a leading customers as they expand their activity in the coming year.", "Second, the performance of our international areas in the first quarter confirmed our belief that activity has now reached bottom in all regions. And although we see positive signs in many countries, both on land and offshore, we expect only moderate sequential growth over the coming quarters. The slower speed of recovery, together with the lingering pricing pressure, means that we expect another challenging year in the international markets in 2017 before a clearer acceleration of activity in 2018.", "And third, as we continue to carefully navigate the current industry landscape, we remain confident and optimistic about the future of Schlumberger, knowing very well that beyond the current market challenges lies a wealth of opportunity for the industry players that are ready to think new and to act new. Thank you very much for listening in.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference.

Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2014 results conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Abu Dhabi, where Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place earlier today. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind participants that some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.21. This is $0.14 lower sequentially but $0.24 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, during the second quarter of last year, we wind down our operations in Iran and classified the results of the business as a discontinued operation and all the prior period amounts have restated.", "Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $11.2 billion decreased 5.6% sequentially, while the pre-tax operating margins declined 18 basis points. Approximately half of the $667 million sequential revenue decrease was a result of the absence of the year end surge in the product software and multi-client sales that we experienced last quarter.", "The remainder of the decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal weather related slowdowns that typically experience in Q1. These factors also accounted for the sequential decline in margins. Given the significant impact that these seasonal factors had on our sequential performance, my comments will focus on year-on-year changes unless otherwise noted.", "Oilfield Services revenue increase 6.3% year-on-year, while pre-tax operating margins grew by 248 basis points. Highlight by product group were as follows. Reservoir characterization revenue of $2.9 billion increased 1.8% while margins grew by 129 basis points to 27.3%. These increases were -- are primarily attributable to a very strong performance in wire line on improved offshore exploration activity.", "Drilling group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 6.6% and margin improved by 249 basis points to 20.3%. These improvements were due to increased technology integration and robust drilling measurement and M-I SWACO activities in the Middle East and Asia. ", "Production group of $4.1 billion increased 9.5%, while margin grew by 313 basis points to 17.9%. This growth was driven primarily by a very strong performance by well services in North America land despite the severe weather.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and the credits was 22.6% in the first quarter compared to 22.3% in the previous quarter. We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. Net debt increased $610 million during the quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting the consumption of working capital that we typically experienced during Q1. Driven by the annual payments associated which increased compensation.", "At 18% of last 12 month revenue, working capital was lower in both absolute terms as well as percentage against the same quarter of last year. Additionally, we spent $899 on our stock buyback program during Q1. We repurchased almost 10 million shares at an average price of $90.31 during the quarter. As you know, back in July of last year, our vote approved new $10 billion share repurchase program. To-date we have repurchased $2.6 billion of shares under this program.", "During the quarter we spent $864 million on CapEx. We generated $688 million of free cash flow compared to $127 million in the same period last year. As it relates to full-year 2014, CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013.", "And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. In spite of severe winter weather impacting activity in our Russia, China, and North America land operations, our first quarter results were solid and fully in line with our expectations. Sequentially revenue dipped from the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal slowdown in activity and lower product and multi-client seismic sales, but grew year over year by just north of 6% while pretax operating income increased by 21% to yield an incremental margin of 60%. ", "The driving force behind these results is further market share gains on the back of growing new technology sales and expanding integration related activity as well as a relentless focus on operational excellence and efficiency. In terms of revenue progression by customer group, our year-over-year growth was driven by the NOCs and the independents which now represent more than 70% of our revenue, while overall activity for the IOCs was more or less flat.", "In the first quarter we generated close to $700 million of free cash flow which is an improvement of almost $550 million compared to the same quarter last year. Based on the growing strength of our free cash flow, we have decided to accelerate our current $10 billion stock buyback program announced in July of last year with the aim of completing the program in two and half years versus the original target of five years. ", "This does not change how we intent to use our cash where the priority continues to be reinvestment in the business to drive growth while we remain opportunistic when it comes to M&A and also plan to renew dividend levels each year. The acceleration of the buyback program is more a reflection of the confidence we have in our business performance and outlook and a signal of our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders.", "Our international business continued to perform well in the first quarter. The seasonal impact of weather and lower product sales resulted in a sequential drop in revenue of 8%. However pre-tax operating margins were resilient at 22.8%, down only 73 basis points from the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, revenue was up 5% on the back of strong growth in the Middle East and Asia while pretax operating margins expanded by 286 basis points driven by new technology sales and strong focus on cost and resource management. ", "In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive and we have not seeing any signs of a general pricing inflection. However our latest technology and our best in class service quality continued to carry a premium which together with the growth in integration related activity is reflected in our revenue rated pricing indicator which is up compared to the first quarter of last year.", "The improvement in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and efficiency puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets which we are using to drive both market share gains and to expand our margins.", "In Latin America, revenue was down 12% sequentially while operating margins were essentially flat at 21.1%. Compared to the same quarter last year revenue was down 8% however pretax operating income was flat due to proactive cost and resource management and also supported by our broad and diverse contract base in the region. ", "The year over year reduction in revenue was predominantly driven by Brazil, where both activity and pricing were significantly down compared to last year. Still, introduction of new technology and swift actions to right size the resource base in the country has enabled us to minimize the negative financial impact from the lower activity. ", "In Mexico, revenue was also down compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by lower budget spend from Pemex, both on land and offshore. The Pemex, mega tender process was concluded during the quarter and we have signed contracts worth $1.9 billion, which represents nearly half of the awarded work scope covering all the major projects in the South and North regions. The resource mobilization for the additional project is ongoing and will be concluded during the second and third quarter as we gradually ramp up the activity.", "In Argentina, year-over-year growth was strong driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale where we are also actively engaging with a number of customers on sub-surface studies and on projects to improve drilling and completion efficiency. In Venezuela, activity was also up year-over-year and we continue to work closely with PdVSA to help them grow production and improve operational efficiency. ", "And in Ecuador we posted strong growth compared to the first quarter of last year, as we continue to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project where we again set the new production record during the quarter. ", "We also secured a right to negotiate for two additional blocks of fields in the country in the latest production in [indiscernible] that took place in the first quarter and these commercial discussions have already started.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue decreased 3% sequentially while operating margins were essentially flat at 26.3%. On a year over year basis, revenue increased 19% and margins were up by 349 basis points. In the Middle East, year over year growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia where we continue to move in resources to keep pace with the additional growth we are taking on, and also by the United Arab Emirates where activity is at a record high. ", "In Southern Iraq, activity was down significantly compared to the same quarter last year as contract awards are delayed due to ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the governments. Based on this as well as the upcoming elections, we do not expect any significant recovery in activity in Southern Iraq in the coming quarters, and we are therefore already taking actions to right size our resource base. Activity in Northern Iraq on the other hand was solid in the first quarter and we expect strong growth there in 2014 leaving full year revenue for the country flat with 2013 and the operating margins approaching the average of the region.", "Southeast Asia posted strong first quarter results driven by high deepwater activity throughout the region, solid SPM performance in Malaysia and very good drilling performance in our IPM project in Queensland, Australia. In China we continue to ramp up activity on our tight gas SPM project with Yanchang Petroleum in the Ordos basin and we are operating a total of 12 rigs at the end of the first quarter.", "In Europe, C.I.S. and Africa, revenue was down 11% sequentially and operating margins were down by 220 basis points. However compared to the same quarter last year when the majority of the [formal] (ph) activity was still included in our ECA numbers, revenue grew by 1% and margins were up by 253 basis points. The year over year revenue growth in the region was also negatively impacted by severe winter weather in Russia as well as the weakening of the ruble that took place during the quarter. Still, the underlying activity both offshore and on land in Russia remains firm for the year. There were also several positive activity signs in parts of Europe and Africa that helped offset the first quarter headwinds in Russia.", "In Norway we posted solid year over year growth driven by market share gains for our drilling services and we expect to see further growth in the second quarter as the seismic season starts and wherever this year will have particular focus on the [balance sheet] (ph). We have also been awarded a five year integrated well construction contract by the Norske for exploration and drilling activity where we will play an integral part of both the planning and execution process. And in West Africa we also posted strong year over year growth driven by both exploration and development work in several of the Gulf of Guinea countries and we still expect strong growth in 2014 in the region in particular from Angola, Gabon and Chad.", "In North America we posted a strong quarter with revenue up 1% sequentially while margins were down 107 basis points to 18.5% driven by pricing pressure and severe winter weather on land as well as drilling delays in the Gulf of Mexico. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew 12% while margins were down 53 basis points. ", "On land, we posted strong year over year growth in revenue driven by market share gains and new technology uptick in pressure pumping as well as solid growth in our artificial lift business where we continue to expand our market position in the rod lift market. Our margins on land were impacted by lower pricing in pressure pumping as we rolled over several key contracts at the end of last year and we also choose to incur additional sand transportation and fuel costs during the periods of severe winter weather to avoid any disruption to our customers\u2019 operations.", "In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater drilling activity was down compared to the first quarter of last year due to a series of operational delays, longer completion times and more work over activity and this impacted several of our product lines. However, the situation is expected to normalize again in the second quarter and the outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year.", "Turning to technology, in 2013, we saw further growth in the rate of high impact commercializations from our RNE organization. This, together with significant improvements and the out of box performance of our new products had a clear impact on our financial results as presented in last month\u2019s Howard Weil conference in New Orleans. In 2014 we expect this trend to continue with a wide range of new technologies scheduled for introduction to the market at the rates that will even surpass 2013. We will showcase a number of these new technologies in our investor events that will take place June 24th and 25th in New York.", "In addition to the latest technologies from reservoir characterization and drilling, we will present a range of new production related technologies including a revolutionary intelligent completion system, our latest multistage completion technology and new fracturing fluid innovation and we will give you an update on our North American land artificial lift business where we see strong growth potential for both ESP and rod pump sales sales. Together with these technology presentations we will review progress on our ongoing transformation programs and also provide an updated financial outlook for the coming three year period.", "Moving on to the macro picture, the global economic data has been mixed so far this year, with the US suffering an unusually half winter, China showing some signs of slowdown, although still projected to grow along 7.5% in 2014 and the situation in Ukraine adding a new risk to the outlook. However, the fundamentals of the global recovery remain intact, as the above factors are likely to only have a temporary impact.", "In contrast to this, the oil markets have been significantly tighter than anticipated, as strong demand trends in OECD and in the Middle East together with continuing supply disruptions in various regions have left to lower spare capacity figures and pushed OECD stocks down to the largest deviation from historical averages since 2003.", "The North American supply search continues to be just enough to equal the world's growing demand, while all other growth regions, including Iraq, Brazil and the Caspian are struggling to meet their production targets. This should continue to support oil prices around $100 a barrel and therefore encourage oil directed investments in both the North American and International markets.", "U.S. natural gas demand reached a new all-time record in Q1, due to the severe winter weather pushing prices to a six year high. However, U.S. supply trends remain strong on the back of the Marcellus and as the weather normalizes over the springs and summer months we expect the North American market to return to a balanced supply demand situation from natural gas.", "International gas markets remain relatively tight largely driven by Chinese demand which continues to grow at double digit rates while European gas demand has eased in the past months on a mild winter. Based on these markets conditions, we continue to expect well related EMP spend to grow by more than 6% in 2014, with spend growth relatively balanced between North America and the international markets. We further expect our year-over-year growth in 2014 to be driven by the NOC\u2019s and the independents.", "After several years of strong growth, our revenue IOCs has dropped over the past two quarters and was in Q1 flat compared to the same quarter last year. However, the first quarter should be the low point for IOC revenue this year, as our latest activity outlook indicates sequential revenue growth from this customer group in the coming quarters and with full year revenue expected to be flat with 2013.", "Equally important to the level EMP spend and the way we translate this into revenue it\u2019s our ability to convert the top line growth into profits. While we plan to deliver a solid incremental margin on the challenging market conditions in North America, we see potential for higher levels in our international business as demonstrated by our first quarter year-over-year incremental margins of 86%.", "We are not likely to maintain these levels to our 2014, but our international incremental margin potential should offer strong support to our earnings growth in the coming year. Furthermore, our broad geographical footprints, our balanced technology portfolio and our agile organization provides us with insulation from market downsides as recently seen in Latin America and allows us to swiftly capitalize on market opportunities, whether in North America or anywhere else in the growth.", "We therefore remain positive and optimistic with respect to the 2014 outlook as we continue to aim for solid double digit growth in earnings per share, fueled by a combination of topline growth, margin expansion and the acceleration of our current stock buyback program.", "That concludes my remarks, we will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). First question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Good morning, Paal. I was wondering if you could expand a bit on your comments with the IOC\u2019s, so 30% business it looks kind of flat, obviously we have seen a lot of headlines of the IOCs cutting CapEx, I was wondering if you could put that into context first a little bit? Can you help us understand how you see it's progressing, is it simply a function of day rates and when day rates come down, the projects start moving ahead. I was just wondering if you can help us how you see that kind of progressing throughout the year.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So let me first start one thing, so I said that the IOCs are now making up well below 30%. So it has dropped over the past couple of quarters. So we have already seen a reduction in their spend. And what we\u2019re saying is that, it\u2019s already flat now year-over-year, the forecast we have from the value, geomarkets and a roll-up indicates our progression in the next couple of quarters and we see the full year basically being flat year-over-year. ", "Now what\u2019s driving that, as we said before, we believe that the primary focus of the CapEx cuts from the IOCs will be on projects that are heavy on infrastructure and probably less so on well rated CapEx, although we have seen some impact on this as well. ", "", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Okay, so if I think about kind of the exploration spend side of that, I guess that\u2019s the part that I wonder the most about. It seems like that might be a little bit more at risk than say, the development CapEx. Can you talk about that from that standpoint, and how that could impact the WesternGeco, because obviously you guys have more exploration risk, so just kind of help us, kind of quantify. Is that a risk for you going forward this year or are you seeing, are you feeling pretty good about that exploration spend even with these kind of chatter-bumpy cuts out there?", "", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We haven\u2019t really changed our view on exploration spend or the seismic spends since the January call. We still expect to see growth in exploration spend in 2014. It\u2019s going to be lower than 2013, and within the exploration spend, we see flattening or flat seismic spend and the growth is going to come through well related spend, through appraisal and exploration type of drilling. So we haven\u2019t really changed the view on either exploration or seismic from the January call. That was already factored into the plan.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays; please go ahead.", "", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Why don\u2019t you just step into North America for a second, clearly the rig count trends have been a little bit better than I think most people anticipated early in the year. How do you see the progress for your business in North America going forward? Is it more that you\u2019re going to gain margin and share from technology or do you actually see some pricing power developing?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at Q1 first of all, in terms of our performance we saw very strong year-over-year growth as I said, with revenue of 12%. And this is a combination of market share gains and new technology uptake. And we continue to gain share and pressure pumping. And this is on the back of efficiency gains and new technology uptake. And we added another two fleets in Q1 from our idle asset program. ", "Now in terms of activity outlook for North America, on land we expect solid activity growth in U.S. land in 2014. We see this being led by South and West Texas. And in addition to the number of wells, we also see supported by again efficiency gains and further uptake of new technology. ", "In terms of Canada, the breakup is going to have the normal impact on Q2 and we see Canada slightly up compared to 2013. ", "And Gulf of Mexico, again Q1 was slow for us because of lower deepwater drilling activity. We see this coming back in Q2 and onwards; so a strong outlook again for Gulf of Mexico.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Okay, so you do it in the Gulf, but this was I think a little or so deepwater rigs scattered into the Gulf from the second half of this year, you do see all those rigs coming and going to work and see the big uptake in the second half of this year. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, we do. And also the number of rigs in Q1 wasn\u2019t really the problem. They -- we regenerate less revenue, although we have completion work there, the amount of revenue per day in completion mode versus full drilling mode is obviously a significant relapse. So it was not a rig count issue, it was an activity type of issue in Q1.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley; please go ahead.", "", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "Paal, I\u2019m just taking one step back at the -- and I want to just have you clarify a little bit a high level question. You mentioned that the oil markets are tighter than one's anticipated. I know you don\u2019t like talking about client production or anything like that, but once you made a statement I feel like I can ask you to elaborate a little bit more on that. I think consensus have probably been more divided on where oil prices are going and this year, and next year are meant to be the big sort of surge in production [indiscernible] that actually highlighted Brazil, Iraq, Caspian and of course North America. So what is that you see here that you don\u2019t think the other -- or that\u2019s positive to make that statement?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Ole I think if you want to build a very kind of bullish case on production, I am sure you can do that. It\u2019s just that if you go back and look at the previous years, there is always an element of project delays and production disruption. And what we said in January is that we expect there to be a normal dose of that in 2014. And so far this year we have seen that, so the market is still relatively tight. Obviously these stocks are down. OpEx spare capacity is down. And there is nothing dramatic in it other than that all the things aren\u2019t lining up as maybe the bull case was at the beginning of the year for production.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Will you tie that to what you see at the customer level of increased project delays now with IOCs being more capital disciplined, or taking a step back here having to borrow for their dividends? Is this something that you think is permanently delayed? How have you changed your view on it, say 2017, let\u2019s say longer term supply growth as a function of what\u2019s going on at a CapEx level at the moment?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think what\u2019s going to happen at least over the next couple of years is that the IOCs will focus more of their spend where they can drill wells and generate production from existing infrastructure or from infrastructure that costs less. So huge infrastructure projects, I would expect to be kind of lower in frequency. And some of them might be postponed as we have already seen. While the focus, again is going to be on generating production which generates cash. So the ability to do that at the lowest possible investment, I think is going to be the focus, which is still good for us.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "So does that mean that you\u2019re more than positive on the areas like the North Sea, let\u2019s say metro areas, Gulf of Mexico than what you will be on frontier exploration like Arctic, Russia or [indiscernible]?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I think for the frontier areas, you will still see exploration I think there is still a push towards delineating and trying to assess what these frontiers contain. So I think although there is lower growth in exploration this year I still think there is going to be lot of interest to try to assess what kind of potential these areas have. Now how the economics of the project was stack up and when development starts, that will I think is going to be a function of what they find and what the economics look like. But I still think there will be a push towards doing exploration in frontier areas, yes.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "And finally back to the U.S. again you have the very impressive growth, you highlight that this was market share gains through new technology. Could you kind of help us understand a little bit now how much was market share gains on your technology and how much did the underlying market grow by in your view?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at the overall rig counts, it was up about 4.5% year over year and I would say partly offsetting that growth also was inefficiencies due to the weather. So a fair bit of this I think for us is market share as well as new technology. So I am not going to give you a detailed number which I am sure you know. But I am quite pleased with how we are continuing to progress in particular, in the pressure pumping market. We added about four fleets in Q3, one fleet in Q4 and another two fleets in the first quarter of this year. And this is all at descent incremental margins, so we are pleased with how we are progressing.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Anything on the technology side you can share or do you want to wait to do it?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I already said a lot more about them what we normally do, so I think that\u2019s going to be it.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Good afternoon, Paal where you are, good morning where we are. I have a follow up question, you addressed a lot of the concerns that investors have had with respect to the outlook on IOC spend and so on in great detail, so thanks for that. Question I would have would be, how do you risk assess from this point forward, right. You put out your targets, you kind of took a look at what\u2019s going on with the offshore elements, it looks like the offshore rig market is still kind of on a slide downward. So from this point forward Paal, if you were to look at the offshore market, how would you risk assess it from here. What do you is the biggest driver? Is it more, what\u2019s the risk on activities really what I\u2019m trying to ask you from your standpoint. Is it Brazil; is it outside of Brazil, where -- how do you see that dynamic spinning up?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well if you focus in on deepwater where I think the biggest discussion has been, this is where the biggest projects are and this is where the biggest discussion are on rig rates all right. We looked at this in detail and if you look at the deepwater market, it\u2019s really two separate stories, you have Brazil and you have the rest of the world. In 2013, Brazil represented around 30% of the global deepwater drilling activity and in Q1 of 2014 Brazil was 20% down in activity while the rest of the world was up 3%. Now for the full year of 2014, we expect Brazil to be down more than 20% versus last year, while the rest of the world we see as being up high single digits. And as we previously indicated in January, the growth in the rest of the world deepwater is going to be driven by sub-Sahara Africa and Gulf of Mexico, so really no change to that. And we also see descent growth in both exploration as well as development for deepwater.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "And then if you take that information Paal, when you roll that up into your outlook from a total international revenue growth standpoint, how should we think about that, is that kind of mid-single digit or double digit still double digit growth, how would you look at the international revenue dynamic for the year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well if you look at the activity outlook or revenue outlook for us in the international markets, again we see well rated CapEx spend growing north of 6% and it\u2019s going to again be driven by both land and offshore. There are a few offsetting factors versus what we said in January, so if you quickly go through those, we do see solid growth in deepwater drilling activity excluding Brazil. In Latin America specifically, we now see this as being flat driven by lower revenue in particular in Brazil but also to a certain extent in Mexico. In Europe and Africa, we are still showing good growth and basically in line with the previous outlook.", "In Russia, the activity outlook is unchanged but the revenue will potentially be lower due to the currently weaker ruble, so what\u2019s going to happen with the ruble as the year progresses we\u2019ll have to see, but if it stays where it is now then revenue is going to be somewhat lower than what we initially expected while activity is the same. Now Middle East and Asia is stronger than we initially expected and that\u2019s driven by several countries in the Middle East as well as Australia. So that\u2019s kind of how we see overall international.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. And then one last follow up, one of the key drivers for the margin performance and earnings performance over the last couple of years has been this internal dynamic for technology and excellence and execution and everything else. As you look out at the North American market going forward, you\u2019ve now established firm leadership versus your peer group. Do you expect the excellence and execution program in technology if your peer group were to grow margins by 100 or 200 basis points, is that\u2019s something that you think you can keep pace with or exceed given the dynamics in play right now.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, like you say we've outperformed our competitors in terms of both topline growth in margin evolution [indiscernible] since like mid-2012. So at this stage I am quite pleased with our position both on land and offshore in North America. So we expect to maintain our margin leadership and at the same time grow faster in revenues. So if our competitors can grow by 100 and 200 basis points, I don\u2019t see why we cannot do the same or exceed it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Thanks. Good morning. Paal so at a recent industry gathering, you offered some interesting commentary about industry challenges and you referenced the fact that E&P CapEx over the last 10 years have grown by 400% or as oil production was only 15%. And you mentioned the fact, that in the E&P value chain, the oil companies were the ultimate integrators of all the technical work associated with finding hydrocarbons and the collective oil services, community was accountable for not delivering on required performance progress. And you also mentioned that the required improvement was not going to come from yet another round of procurement driven price reductions across the E&P value chain. So along those lines, as the industry is in introspective mood with where the IOCs and deepwater [indices] (ph) in terms of getting their deepwater cost and alignment, apart from the mix shift from infrastructure to well CapEx, what structural reforms are clients contemplating, implementing and the discussions you\u2019re having with your clients along those lines?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think if you look at the short term actions they are taking today, they are looking at bringing the deepwater rig rates down. I mean, if you look at what\u2019s happened on deepwater day rates over the past three, four, five years they have increased significantly and they have been completed disconnected from the other deepwater oilfield services, right. So today the rig rental makes up around 50% of the deepwater well cost, so customers have really been looking for the opportunity to get the rig rental rates down and the opportunity is here in form of the high number of new arrivals, all contract expiring and a significant reduction activity in Brazil. So I think this is the opportunity. In the short term they are trying to get some relief on cost. ", "Now my comments in terms of a procurement driven exercise across the industry, is more focused in on, we need to basically drive off the technical performance as an industry, whether that is process efficiency or reliability of the projects that we execute. So what some of my customers are doing is they are, they are approaching us a lot more than in the past in terms of doing fully integrated projects, where we are a lot more engaged in the upfront planning and the sign of the work. And where we have a more performance based contracts in terms of how we execute the work as well. So these are some of the short terms actions that they are taking. And I think beyond that I think the service industry needs to take responsibility in terms of finding way of transforming themselves to drive both their internal efficiencies and their technical performance versus the customers that is how we can create more value and support our customers.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Okay. And secondly, coming out of the last quarter, you offered some helpful, I guess, parameters for the first quarter earnings possibilities. Do you have just a high level broad commentary with regard to what we should be focused on with regard to second quarter earnings possibilities?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at Q2, we should see seasonal recovery in Russia and China and also less weather impact in U.S. land. Now this is going to be partially offset by the normal spring break up in Canada which has already started. And beyond this we are expecting steady growth in the underlying business as per the other discussions we\u2019ve had so far today. So our aim for the second quarter is to bring Q2 EPS back to the level of Q4 of last year. That is for us a good target.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse", "Good morning. And Bill Herbert, thank you for asking the question. And all thank you for the answer on the integrated projects. Let me carry that on, you mentioned several times in the press release about integrated projects, their accretion to margins. Can you talk about performance related contracts and what those returns look like relative to the rest of your business?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, in general, Jim, the performance based contracts are accreted to our margins. So we take on performance based contracts where we have a pretty good handle on the environment that we operate in. We have a very good handle on how our customers are operating and are interfacing and supporting our operations. And also what kind of controls we have to drive performance. So I would say in general our performance based contracts and a lot of them are within the drilling group, if you take away the production incentive contracts, they are generally accretive to our margins and if you look at the drilling group margin evolution over the past two, three years, you see a very steady improvement from the time we took over Smith in back in 2010.", "Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Thank you for that. My follow-up question is, your self-help efforts, your transformational efforts internally, those mean a lot and they\u2019re structural and they last for a long time. Which markets do you see those efforts having the biggest impact in over the next two to three years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think they will have impacts globally. We piloted some of these things in North America when we did the initial restructuring of North America land back in when we started in 2010 and that\u2019s being some of the basis for our improvements in North America over the past three-four years. But what we are doing is now starting to pilot in small scale in various other parts of the world and this is going to take several years before we get fully implemented. But at the end of the day, the transformation programs that I\u2019ve been talking about publicly over the past year, will impact all parts of the company, both geographically and in terms of technology.", "Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And if I could, when we look at the globe of the world, what area, what region do you think has the best upside to margins over the next two to three years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It\u2019s difficult to think, but I would say that -- as I said in my prepared remarks, if you look at incremental margins, we are going to focus in on driving incremental margins throughout our business. With some of the, I would say challenges in particularly in North America land with that we\u2019ve been facing on pricing, it is still more difficult to drive very high incremental margins in North America although we are going to try, but the overall international markets I still think has a significant incremental margin potential and as I also mentioned, year over year Q1 we had 86% incremental margins in international.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities", "Thank you. Paal, if well based CapEx is up 6% globally, is that an environment that you can grow your revenues in double digits?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It\u2019s a difficult question to answer. I mean is it possible? Yes. Are we going to get to double digits? I can\u2019t really say and I wouldn\u2019t commit to it. But the fact that we have the potential of growing our revenues higher than the 6% is I think is very clear.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities", "Okay. Second question Paal is getting back to North American pricing for today\u2019s technology, not newer technology, but is the 6% increase in well based CapEx in the U.S. in 2014 sufficient to drive pricing anywhere in the U.S. in any product lines for again today\u2019s technology?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think overall I don\u2019t think 6% is going to be sufficient to have a wide spread price increase in commodity type of technologies. Now you might have small pockets where there is a surge of activity and there is insufficient capacity to deliver. You might have situations where new technologies are introduced or where efficiencies are stepped up, where you can drive your effective pricing. But at this stage I would say that we are expecting North America land pricing overall, we are hoping it\u2019s going to flatten from where it is now, that\u2019s going to be the forecast I would say that we have going forward and then we are looking on top of that to drive up our effective pricing through a new technology introduction and by driving efficiency of our operations.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities", "Okay, good answer. And then last question, Paal you talked about Brazil, what is the risk in your opinion of continued slides in activity in Brazil throughout this year and even into 2015? It seems like every rig that\u2019s coming off contract they\u2019re releasing.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, so as already said, I think Brazil activity, Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be significantly down versus 2013, it\u2019s a combination of both activity as you say as well as the pricing on the new contracts that we took on during 2013. So there is no surprise that Brazil revenue is going to be down significantly and that\u2019s already factored into these discussions and the outlook that I\u2019ve been giving today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Paal, you mentioned before China there was some weakness in the quarter. Where do you see the outlook? Is this temporary and then what\u2019s going on there for the year and beyond?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we still expect solid growth in China in 2014. It\u2019s going to be a bit lower than 2013 partly due to some of these budget reductions that we have seen from the NOCs. But our focus in the China land market is very much on penetrating it further and if you look at our overall penetration of that market it is still very low. So, we aren\u2019t immediately impacted significantly by these budget reductions. We are seeing significantly high demand for our new technology, for our technical expertise and also for project management. So that\u2019s why we are still quite optimistic about China. And growth is going to be driven by land both in terms of conventional type gas and shale gas, and offshore is also going to continue to be solid. So I would say solid growth in 2014, a bit lower than 2013.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then in the Middle East it seems to be pretty active area, as you mentioned. Is there a way to quantify what kind of revenue growth could be possible from the Middle Eastern areas, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, that area?", "", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It is vague. Yes, and we have done it. But I\u2019m not going to share the outlook with you in great detail, other than we see it -- we saw it as a major growth driver for 2014 and it has confirmed its potential and it might even be slightly up in April versus where we thought it would be in January.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So could it be in the upper teens growth rate there or mid teen growth rates, in that kind of range?", "", "Paal Kibsgaard", "", "I\u2019m not going to give you a number. You can look at the Q1 year-over-year number which was pretty solid.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil; please go ahead.", "", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Thanks, good morning. Paal, I found your comments on the southern Iraq interesting. I know Iraq had been one of the five countries I think you had outlined previously as kind of the highest growth markets for you. Has there been any change in terms of your thought on Iraq in general here in how the proceeds for Schlumberger, as going forward and maybe just on a year-over-year basis?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, for 2014 the main change has been that the activity in the south is going to be down. And this is mainly driven by ongoing discussions between the IOCs and the Ministry. There are things that they need to sort out and agree upon before they will move forward and award some of these lump-sum turnkey contracts that are pending. So until that happens, there isn\u2019t going to be a lot of work awarded in the south. And with the upcoming elections, we don\u2019t think that that situation and these bids are going to be awarded in the next couple of quarters. We think that is probably a late year event before it happens. ", "So that\u2019s why activity in Southern Iraq for this year is going to be down. Now offsetting this is very strong activity growth in Northern Iraq. And here we have an excellent market position. It\u2019s a lot focused on high-end exploration and we are able to offset the reduced activity in revenue in the South with growth in the North. So that 2014 Iraq revenue is going to be flat year-over-year and the margins are also now quickly approaching the average for the region. So overall, it\u2019s somewhat downgrading of the growth in Iraq, but both margins and as well as the offsetting factor of the North is positive.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "My follow-up would be, I know you said sometime, talking about the topline expectations in Latin America and the headwinds in Brazil. Your commentary on Mexico, I think is least as we start to think about the exiting 2014 on a year-over-year basis seemed more positive. Just thoughts there in terms of when you perhaps see year-over-year growth in Mexico or I guess number one, my follow-up to it will be just on the margins in Latin America. You\u2019ve done a pretty good job of holding those relatively flat. Perhaps I missed it, but I don\u2019t think I heard any thoughts on the kind of margin growth we should expect that to move forward here in Latin America or just is relatively flat a good expectation?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I think overall for Latin America, I think flat is a good word. I think we see overall revenue to be flattish this year. And we are going to work very hard on maintaining our margins around the levels that we had in 2013. So far this year that's worked out well. And we will continue to focus in on that. ", "So, obviously a significant negative on Brazil which we already talked about. Mexico is more of a positive story. But in the short-term here what we see is a lot more budget discipline from Pemex; and also a little bit more hesitance towards spend as this ongoing reform proceeds. But as you know, we had some significant wins in the mega tenders, where we have gained significant shares and we will be ramping up activity in Q2 and into H2. So we expect to be exiting Mexico this year on a pretty good note and that will be a good driver for us in 2015.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein; please go ahead. ", "", "Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein", "Paal, can you talk about your strategy in North American and rod lift? You see a path to transform legacy products through technology development or is there any interest in the space largely based on a view of end-market growth?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, so we are interested in North America land artificial lift markets, and we have followed it for some time. There is clearly significant growth potential there. It\u2019s a huge market. There are hundreds of thousands of wells that installed rod lifts and we see a significant opportunity to apply more science and technology into this markets and also to help drive production and cost per barrel. So, if you want to be part of transforming a market which obviously are ultimate goal this year, and transforming it to the benefit of our customers, we are firm believers that you have to play in it; you cannot change it from the side lines. So while we have a growing ESP business in the North America land for the, shale liquid wells, we also believe that we need to have a complete offering and what we are looking to do now is to combine our ESP offering with these rod lift companies that we have both over the recent quarters. And then ultimately provide a life of well lift solution to our customer base. And that could be ESP for part of the life and it could be a rod pump for the other part of the life. So we are working on this and we will give a further off take on this business both I would say further strategy as well as technology in our June investor event.", "Scott Gruber - Sanford Bernstein", "Great. In an unrelated follow-up in Russia, Rosneft appears to be taking a new strategy toward contracting rigs. Have you noticed a change in how they cooperate with the service companies? Are they starting to push back on pricing for any of your services?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "As far as I know, we haven\u2019t had any recent discussions with Rosneft on pricing beyond what is normal for our services. Exactly what Rosneft do in terms of oil contracting rigs, I don\u2019t have any further comments to what their strategy is, no.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Paal I wanted to ask you about Saxon and sort of more strategically Schlumberger in the last few years has been moving away from the more asset intensive segments with the sale of rigs in Russia, and obviously the spark business model in U.S. pumping. Can you -- is something changing with respect to that strategy or was this just an acquisition or consolidation of opportunity?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No you\u2019re right. I mean, we continue to focus on return on capital employed and to be, would say capital efficient as we go forward. So there is no change in the strategy here, but let me just give you a little bit of the rationale for why we are acquiring Saxon. So land rigs has always been a key part of our integration platform for well construction. ", "Now in the past, and what led to the set-up of Saxon where we have basically sold them the rigs, we sold the rigs to Eurasia in Russia as well is that our priority in the past have been basically to have access to rigs from a trusted provider. It\u2019s more a capacity issue that we\u2019ve been focusing in, in the past. What we are doing now is that we are evolving this view to also seeing the land rig as a critical element of how we drive drilling performance. So what we planned to do at this stage now and Saxon is generally focused on the international market where we have basically all of our integration related business. We plan to invest in optimizing rig design and rig operations by combining Saxon\u2019s rig engineering and rig management capabilities with our existing drilling expertise from both IPM and the drilling group. So there are some third party rigs within the Saxon fleet today, it\u2019s quite a few and we will continue to support them, and if there are opportunity to do third party rentals, we will continue to do. But we are predominately buying Saxon because we want to have our own rig provider that we can help, help us drive the performance of our integration business for well construction.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "Very interesting. Thank you. On Venezuela, I know that PdVSA has been working with IOCs and [indiscernible] to try to work with terms and get activity higher to raise production. Can you may be talk about what you see happening in that market over the next year, do you think there will be success there and the 2015 could be a much bigger year in Venezuela potentially?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, for us Venezuela today is actually quite good. Activity in Q1 was solid. It was up more than 20% year over year and as you say, we have a close working relationship with PdVSA and as we put our payment agreement with them in place, payments are regular and they are according to plan. So we are in reasonably good shape there. ", "So looking forward for this year, we see continued increase in the rig counts. And these addition of rigs are mainly focused in on the [indiscernible] and we continue to ramp up our resources and expertise in the country, right. We have a number of projects with PdVSA where we are working with them to drive operational efficiency and obviously to help them drive up production. So we see Venezuela for 2014 to be one of the positives in Latin America.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "Wondering, if you -- you guys have introduced a couple of [leasebacks] (ph) to the U.S. frac market from your stat capacity. I wondered if you could just talk us through how you are thinking about further efficiency gains in your frac fleet here in the U.S. as well as the ability to for the market to absorb incremental capacity for new well this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think the overall activity in terms of new wells and in terms of frac stages is going to be up in 2014. And whether we will add more capacity into this, I think is going to be a function of the pricing and the incremental margins we will get on the addition of fleets that we put in. All the fleets that we have introduced over the past three quarters, these criteria have been met, and that\u2019s why we have been adding them, right. So we are currently today operating at 82% in terms of 24 hour operations, which has been obviously a key driver for efficiency. And other than that we are focusing in on term contracts. So we have about 90% of our pressure pumping contract volume on term. And we do that because we see that as a key element to help drive efficiency. That\u2019s how we get predictable work. And we have a close working relationship with our customers for planning and scheduling. And also having term contracts and longer term relationships other than the spots, also helps us in the way we work together with them in terms of technical collaboration as well as new technology introduction. So, I am reasonably optimistic about our ability to continue to gain share in that market. What\u2019s going to happen to base pricing, I think base pricing as of now we are looking for it to flatten out.", "", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "Your second question is just around the seismic outlook. I know the backlog can be choppy for that business, but it was up a reasonable amount sequentially to exit Q1, does that -- has that changed at all the Schlumberger outlook for the marine seismic business as the rest of the year plays out?", "", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, we haven\u2019t changed our outlook for the seismic business since January. So like you said, the backlog was up 196 million sequentially and 49 million year-over-year. This was driven both by land and marine. And in terms of the 2014 outlook for seismic, we maintained the outlook that we did in January, that it\u2019s going to be flattish in terms of overall spend this year. We continue to see pressure on basic marine pricing, we saw that in Q1. But in terms of Q2 and Q3 activity and our bookings and utilization is looking quite reasonable. So we did no change to what we looked at in January. ", "Simon Farrant", "Okay, that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. Now on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Greg will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. ", "Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your questions. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures.", "A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat ", "Thanks Malcolm, ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter income was $0.67 per share, this is up $0.02 sequentially and down $0.36 compared to the same quarter of last year, excluding the $0.08 of charges we took in Q4 of last year. ", "Turning the business segments, Oilfield services fourth quarter revenue increased 4% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 19%. Roughly one third of the sequential increase in OFS is attributable to the additional year-end surge in product sales. ", "Oilfield services pre-tax operating income of $1 billion decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield services margins declined by 157 basis points sequentially to 19.5%, as improvements in the Middle East and Asia was more than offset by declines in North America, Latin America, and Europe/CIS/Africa. ", "Overall international margins in OFS were 23.4%. By area Oilfield services sequential pre-tax operating margins highlights were as follows. North America declined by 129 basis points to 2.1% as increased activity in the US land and Gulf of Mexico geo markets were insufficient to increase the impact of less favorable revenue mix in Canada and lower activity in the Alaska geo market. ", "Latin America decreased by 254 basis points to 15.8% primarily as a result of the reduced activity and the less favorable revenue mix in the Mexico/Central America geo market. Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 21.6%, 208 basis points lower principally due to lower activity in Russia as a result of year end customer budget constraints. ", "Finally Middle East/Asia margin improved by 66 basis points to 32.4% primarily due to the positive impact of the more favorable mix of deepwater and exploration related activity and year-end software sales. ", "At WesternGeco pre-tax income of $115 million reflected an increase in pre-tax margins of 776 basis points to 20.9%. This increase was largely attributable to year-end multi client sales partially offset by the impact of the lower pricing and project delays in marine. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 17.6%. This was lower than last quarter primarily due to more favorable geographic earnings mix. As we have previously mentioned and as you saw this quarter the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earnings mix and as such we may continue to experience volatility on a quarterly basis. ", "Net debt was $126 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $660 million at the end of Q3 and $1.1 billion at the end of last year. This improvement was driven by strong cash flows from operations. We ended the quarter with $5.4 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition $2.8 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused and were available at the end of December. ", "This compares to short-term debt of only $1.1 billion which as a reminder includes $321 million of convertible debentures which we expect to be converted to equity by the end of second quarter of 2010. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $500 million of stock repurchases, $676 million of CapEx and $231 million of pension funding. ", "We restarted our stock buyback program during the quarter and bought back 7.8 million shares at an average price of $63.91. Our Q4 buyback activity served to offset the vast majority of the dilution caused by our stock based compensation programs during all of 2009.", "Oilfield services CapEx is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2010 as compared to $1.9 billion in 2009. WesternGeco CapEx is expected to approach $300 million as compared to $460 million in 2008. ", "In summary our balance sheet remains very strong and it continues to provide us with a tremendous amount of financial flexibility. And now I will turn the conference over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould ", "Thank you Simon, good morning everybody. Fourth quarter revenue increased sequentially in North America, Latin America, and Middle East/Asia areas as offshore revenue quality improved with increasing deepwater rig count while software and product sales saw the usual fourth quarter strength. ", "Europe/CIS/Africa area revenue was flat with the previous quarter though stronger offshore activity and year-end software and product sales in the area were not sufficient to offset the seasonal decline in Russia. Amongst the technology, sequential growth was driven by increased deepwater and exploration related activity leading to demand for wire line, testing services and drilling and measurements technologies, while growth was also recorded on land in North America primarily from increased well services activity. ", "WesternGeco achieved highly satisfactory fourth quarter multi client revenues due largely to wide-azimuth survey sales in the Gulf of Mexico. I will now turn to the areas in more detail. ", "In North America where revenue increased sequentially by 6%, the US land geo market grew on increased drilling activity. This however was offset by lower pricing for well services technologies. The US Gulf of Mexico geo market revenue was up marginally due to improved shelf activity and the beginning of a build up in the deepwater, but these positive effects were hampered by downtime associated with Hurricane Ida as well as some pricing pressure. ", "Canada revenue was flat with the previous quarter but of lower quality while Alaska revenue fell sequentially due to a slowdown in activity resulting from operator budget constraints. In Latin America revenue grew 5% sequentially and in the Peru/Columbia/Ecuador geo market revenue increased primarily on greater demand for drilling and measurements, wire line and testing services, with this demand resulting from increased drilling activity. ", "Higher SIS software sales and artificial lift products also contributed to the growth. In Brazil revenue was higher from increased offshore exploration activity as well as from the software sales and completions product sales. The Venezuela/Trinidad/Tobago geo market recorded growth primarily from integrated project management activity while activity in Argentina/Bolivia/Chili was higher due to increased activity and SIS software sales. ", "These increases however were partially offset by a decrease in Mexico/Central America where revenue that resulted declined as a result of a reduced activity. Revenue in the Europe/CIS/Africa area was flat with the previous. In Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea revenue grew as a result of strong testing services product sales and an increase in exploration activity that led to greater demand for wire line services. ", "In Western Southern Africa revenue increased on high demand for drilling and measurement services. The North Sea geo market also recorded growth primarily as a result of increased well services stimulation activity while the Libya geo market revenue increased due to higher deepwater testing services and wire line exploration activity.", "These increases were however partially offset by the lower revenue in Russia as a result of client budgeting constraints and seasonal weather effects which mainly effected IPM activity. Revenue was also lower in North Africa on reduced testing product sales and in the Caspian geo market on the completion of drilling campaigns. In the Middle East and Asia sequential revenue growth of 7% was driven by an increase in deepwater and exploration related activities that led to strong demand for wire line services. ", "Seasonal artificial lift and SIS software product sales also contributed to growth. As I mentioned earlier sequential revenue growth at WesternGeco was led by multi client through strong year-end sales of wide-azimuth surveys in the US Gulf of Mexico. Land revenue also grew due to increased activity in the Middle East and North Africa but overall these increases were somewhat offset by a significant decrease in marine as a result of weaker pricing, project start up delays, and [vessel] transits. ", "Our outlook for 2010 remains largely dependent on the prospects for the general economy. At the end of the third quarter we indicated that we were encouraged that signs were emerging that the demand for oil and gas would begin to increase. Consensus forecast now predict that oil demand in 2010 will increase particularly in the developing world for the first time since 2007.", "As a result we feel that oil prices are likely to be sustained at current levels and that as our customers\u2019 confidence grows exploration and production budgets will increase. We feel that considerable leverage to increase investment exists in offshore markets, in Russia, as well as in certain emerging investment opportunities such as Iraq. ", "These events will be dependent on continued increases in economic growth in the second half of the year beyond the current government stimulus packages. For natural gas activity we remain a great deal more cautious. Despite signs of some recovery in industrial demand and recent cold weather, we consider that worldwide markets remain generally over supplied. ", "Increased flows of LNG together with additional capacity being added in 2010 as well as a general uncertainty over the decline rates of unconventional gas production have the potential to limit the current increase in North American gas drilling rig count. ", "We anticipate that 2010 will be a better year for multi client seismic, an improved activity for land seismic particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. While marine activity will be reasonably robust pricing improvements will be limited due to continued new capacity additions. ", "Longer-term, we remain increasingly confident that considerably increased spending will be necessary to maintain sufficient reserves in production of hydrocarbons to meet the world\u2019s need. Our technology portfolio and worldwide infrastructure mean we are strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities as our customers begin to increase their investment.", "And I will now hand the call back over to Malcolm.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you Andrew, we will now open the call for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "I will kick off with Iraq, you\u2019ve been very cautious about your commentary on Iraq all along. This is the first time we hear you highlighting Iraq as a significant area of opportunity, can you discuss through what it is that\u2019s changed with respect, I presume to timing and magnitude and relative to your previous thoughts.", "Andrew Gould ", "Well the change relative to my previous thinking is the results of the second round. And the time constraints have been put on the operators to reach the initial plateau production. If that timetable is adhered to, then it implies a huge amount of service activity over the next two or three years. ", "Now you know I have to have my normal caveats, they are that the election takes place with a satisfactory political result and that some form of oil law is put into place because I still don\u2019t think our customers will make major, major commitments until that happens. ", "But currently given what they\u2019ve signed, it would seem that there is going to be a considerable increase in activity in Iraq. I don\u2019t think it will have a material effect on results in 2010 but we may well start to see the ramp up in the second half of the year. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Can you talk a little bit about how you see Schlumberger being proficient. What are the big obstacles, competitive advantages that you would have in Iraq. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Well I\u2019m not going to do that over a phone line where all my competitors are listening, but we have a very robust plan in place. We have inherited relationships from the past in Iraq. We have everything necessary to operate legally from the past. And the signs are very encouraging that the offering we have is going to be competitive. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "You mentioned exploration, you mentioned development and it seems in your customer inquiry levels with the spec to kind of the next 12 to 18 months compared to the previous 12 to 18 months, are we going to have an exploration recovery or is it going to be drilling in terms of your product offering of not only seismic but everything else from open hole, wire line--", "Andrew Gould ", "Well I think it will be both but the ratio of new deepwater rigs and the places where they\u2019re going means there will be a lot of, quite a lot of exploration and appraisal. So beyond this year if commodity prices hold where they are I think we will see a recovery in exploration. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt ", "Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt ", "Your capital spending for 2010 is fairly significant uptick, how much impact do you think that\u2019s going to have on 2010 or is this really more of a 2011\u2014", "Andrew Gould ", "We\u2019re counting outside the normal replacement CapEx and some IPM projects and stuff like that, we\u2019re counting that in 2008 we had eight deepwater new builds come into our market, 23 in 2009, and 35 in 2010. Now you know that they don\u2019t all come on the first of January so you probably have to chop those numbers in half in any one year. ", "But what it does mean is there is still significant deepwater CapEx that\u2019s going to come through in 2010 and as you rightly point out a lot of that will be only revenue generating in 2011. ", "Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt ", "If I think about, I\u2019m just, your commentary is I guess a little bit cautious, your actions are more aggressive, I\u2019m thinking about as we look out to 2011 and I realize that\u2019s still a year away but I look back at 2008 and see a $27 million revenue number, we\u2019re clearly lower than that in 2009, we\u2019ll be lower than that in 2010, but is that in the gun sights for 2011 given everything you see and the amount of money you\u2019re spending and the way you think the marketplace out. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Well actually that depends entirely on North America. I have no doubt we will have a significant upswing overseas but don\u2019t forget the significant drop in our revenue is in North America compared to the $27 billion you\u2019re talking about. North America and seismic, put it that way. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "I have a question on the gas side actually, you definitely appear more confident in the oil fundamentals than gas and you mentioned natural gas in the note and in your comments, that\u2019s really a challenge, but that wasn\u2019t really clearly in North America comment was what I read into it, how important to global upstream activity do you think an uptick in gas related activity is. ", "Andrew Gould ", "We\u2019re not counting on any big uptick in gas related activity in the next couple of years outside North America. The big [Katary] projects will come on, the Yemen project has come on. There are other projects that are coming on. So yes you will see a few big gas developments in Asia probably but we\u2019re not counting on a big increase in gas because as I said earlier, worldwide the gas market is substantially over supplied at this point in time. ", "Can I just qualify that, there are domestic gas plays that people are doing to substitute energy sources particularly in the Middle East. So in Saudi, Kuwait, Orman, Abu Dhabi, places like that there gas activity, but it is local its not for export, its for substitute power sources within the country. ", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "I guess does this modestly or highly contain potential upside or maybe the pace of what we looks like the beginning of another up cycle here. You had mentioned that North America was going to limit your ability to get to those numbers that Dan had laid out, is this a bigger deal or just sort of a smaller deal, the international gas activity. ", "Andrew Gould ", "No I don\u2019t think, I think it\u2019s a smaller deal than the two factors I mentioned to Dan. ", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "How does international gas activity rank in terms of oil service intensity versus oil or even domestic natural gas activity. ", "Andrew Gould ", "The sources of gas are becoming so diverse that\u2019s a very difficult question to qualify. For example most of the Middle East gas is highly toxic. It has very high H2S fractions, a lot of it has high C02 content and therefore these are fairly high cost operations, they\u2019re fairly service intensive and they imply specialized equipment and a lot of measurement to establish what the gas stream consists of.", "And then you go to other places like the Northwest shelf in Australia where its really nice clean gas and they\u2019re less intensive. But overall I would say in the development phase there is not a great deal of difference.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "I was wondering if you would be able to give us some color on some of the pricing trends that are evolving both in North America and international and what can of an impact that would have on either margin improvement or margin degradation as we move out into 2010. ", "Andrew Gould ", "As I said in my script, US land revenues were up but we did not feel any pricing traction in US land until December. So it didn\u2019t effect the quarter really. The pricing traction we have in US land particularly in pressure pumping is in the more complex operations where frankly if we don\u2019t get price increases we lose money because we\u2019re tearing our equipment to pieces.

", "Andrew Gould ", "I think that the IOCs have generally realized that there are lots of criteria to judge where you invest. One is stable political environment, large domestic market, and new resource and I think the IOCs have realized that there is a substantial new resource in North America and the technology for that resource has been developed in North America and therefore they are now investing in it.

", "Andrew Gould ", "I think that we would say that Russia was able to sustain its domestic production in 2009 through the addition of new fields in Eastern Siberia, notably [Rancor].

Total fleet size is the same but recording boats are down. We have some very large multi client programs in the Gulf of Mexico which are very well funded. And the rest of our capacity through the half year I think is largely booked up.

This is the topic most people I think have said these unconventional resources are steeply declining production profiles, you seem to be raising a question about that. ", "Andrew Gould ", "No, I don\u2019t disagree that there are steeply declining production profiles, but I don\u2019t think we know yet because of the backlog of gas behind pipe that had not be stimulated and completed because of the actual huge increase in the profile of unconventional gas that we really, really know how much its going to decline in 2010.", "And you know I saw a very good paper from a rival firm recently, which showed actually that LNG has the potential to balance that decline. Gas consumption is Europe is way off. So a lot of that LNG becomes spot, it has the capacity to offset the decline. Now whether that will happen is another story but that\u2019s why I\u2019m cautious.

Secondly, how do you see the likely profitability of the work in Iraq versus other countries in the region, and thirdly, do you think that there\u2019ll be issues surrounding the capacity of the oil service industry to service all these projects if they all seem to want to come in the second half of the year.", "Andrew Gould ", "So if I can answer the third part first, if they all want to come in the second part of the year, yes. And if I can answer the first one then, yes, I do think they\u2019re largely going to be IPM type projects largely because there is very low infrastructure on the ground particularly rigs. And therefore the capacity to do IPM and to put rigs on the ground is going to be extremely, the determining factor in the first year or so.

Directional has never been effected as much as wire line or pressure pumping because as you know the horizontal count has grown so much that I think there\u2019s issues, no pricing issues with directional equipment. And pressure pumping I don\u2019t really know but I think its considerably higher than where we are today. ", "I think one of two things are going to happen, either all these, either the rig count will increase, or and I suspect this is more likely, all these massive fracs are going to tear up so much equipment that the market will come in to balance through equipment disappearing more rapidly than it usually does. ", "Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital", "Looking at the international land business do you see an increased amount of that business going IPM in the future and if so will there be a significant increase and what are the implications for margins and profitability if indeed that is the case. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Well let me put it this way, despite the drop in Mexico, Schlumberger\u2019s IPM revenues will increase in 2010 largely due to Russia and the Middle East.

(Operator Instructions) At this time then, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Kent. Welcome to today\u2019s second quarter 2007 conference call. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to review the logistics and agenda. ", "Some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. For today\u2019s agenda, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer, will begin with commentary on the financial results. And then Andrew Gould, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the second quarter activity and outlook. Finally, we\u2019ll take questions from the audience. ", "Now, Simon Ayat will discuss the financials. ", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon and thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter net income was $1.02 per share, up $0.06 sequentially and $0.29 above the same quarter of last year before charges, $0.33 after charges. ", "Oilfield Services generated $1.5 billion in pretax operating income, reaching a pretax margin of 30.4%, a sequential improvement of 90 basis points. By area the highlights were as follows: North America pretax margin declined 21 basis points sequentially to 31.2%, due to the seasonal spring break-up in Canada and erosion of the pressure pumping stimulation pricing, which was largely compensated by strong exploration-related activity in Alaska, increased deepwater drilling offshore in the Gulf Coast, and service intensity combined with a slightly higher rig count in U.S. land. ", "Latin America pretax margin was 23.6%, sequentially up 118 basis points, reflecting improved margins in Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago and Peru, Colombia, Ecuador geo-markets, partially offset by higher project start-up costs in the Mexico geo-market. ", "For ECA, our Europe, Africa, CIS unit, the pretax margin improved 43 basis points sequentially to 28.7%, with Russia rebounding after the seasonal winter slowdown and sustained exploration activity in the North Sea further augmented by strong performance in the North Africa geo-market. ", "Middle East, Asia pretax margin increased 103 basis points sequentially to 35.3% on improvements in the Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, China, Japan, Korea, and East Mediterranean geo-markets with increased activity. Specifically, a boost to exploration efforts across Asia and the Middle East while margin in Arabian and Gulf geo-markets remain steady. ", "WesternGeco pretax margin was $216 million, a deterioration of 525 basis points sequentially to 32.5%. Multi-client margins declined. There was a seasonal slowdown in sales, particularly in North America while marine margins improved as pricing and vessel production gains more than offset the impact of increased transits and scheduled dry docks. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 22.3%, 1.7 percentage points lower than last quarter, which is mainly due to the geographic mix of earnings. Both OFS and WesternGeco had a lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America and internationally, various geo-markets with lower tax rates contributed to greater percentage to pretax earnings. ", "Based on the projected geographic mix of earnings within OFS and WesternGeco for the remainder of the year, the full-year ETR is expected to be slightly lower than last year and above Q2 levels. ", "The earnings for the quarter included $34 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation as compared to $37 million in the previous quarter. We expect this expense for the full year 2007 to be approximately $140 million, a $26 million increase over 2006. ", "As of June 30, net debt was $2.1 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $172 million for the stock buy-back program; CapEx, including multi-client, of $802 million. In addition, during the quarter, $396 million of series A convertible debentures were converted by holders into approximately 11 million shares of Schlumberger common stock. CapEx, excluding $61 million of multi-client surveys capitalized, was $741 million for the quarter and is expected to reach approximately $3.1 billion for the year 2007. ", "During the quarter, we bought back 2.2 million shares for $172 million at an average price of $78.20. This brings the total share buy-back under the 40 million shares repurchase program announced last April to 20.9 million shares for $1.3 billion at an average price of $62.90 per share. ", "Now, I turn the conference over to Andrew. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Thank you, Simon. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Second quarter results were driven by the increasing pace of international activity with sequential growth for Oilfield Services accelerating in all areas except North America, where higher activity on land and in the Gulf Coast was not sufficient to completely offset a significant downturn in Canada. ", "Across all areas, demand was high for drilling and measurements, wireline, artificial lift and well services technologies, as well as for Schlumberger Information Solutions products and services. Oilfield Services pretax margin reached a new high of 30.4%, led by an exceptional performance in the Middle East Asia area due to continued favorable revenue mix from exploration services, particularly in Asia. ", "In North America, the U.S. land geo-markets recorded strong sequential growth due to higher activity and higher service intensity, particularly for well services, wireline, and drilling and measurement technology directed at horizontal wells in unconventional gas reservoirs. Further north in Alaska, demand remained high for exploration related services. ", "Growth was also seen in the U.S. Gulf Coast geo-market as the service mix returned more to drilling and measurements, well services and well testing following the shift to completion-related services seen in the first quarter. This positive performance was overshadowed, however, by the expected weakness in Canada that resulted from the early spring break-up and lower natural gas prices reflected in lower activity levels. ", "In Latin America, strong revenues were recorded as the remaining negotiations with PDVSA related to the [Presa] rig management and engineering contracts were concluded, enabling recognition of previously deferred revenue. This had only a marginal effect, however, on sequential growth in the area\u2019s revenue and pretax operating income, which were primarily driven by demand for technologies, products and services across the area. The technologies that benefited included wireline, well testing and artificial lift in Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago; wireline, well services, well testing and information systems and completions in Latin America itself; wireline and IPM in Peru, Colombia and Ecuador; and well services in Mexico. ", "Sequential revenue growth in Europe, the CIS and Africa was driven by higher activity in the East Russia, Continental Europe, Libya and North Africa geo-markets. Demand was strong for exploration-related wireline, drilling and measurements technologies in the North Sea, and for well services technologies in North Russia. The North Sea and North Russia geo-markets also saw higher sales of artificial lift systems products, while completion product sales were higher in the North Sea. Growth was, however, moderated by seasonal weather effects in South Russia. ", "The strong sequential growth in revenue in the Middle East, Asia area was driven by higher activity in Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, [Ghata], Australia, Papua New Guinea and China geo-markets; stronger exploration-driven deep water activity in the Eastern Mediterranean; and higher demand for wireline completions and artificial lift technologies in the Arabian geo-market. But this growth was partially offset, however, by a lower exploration rig count in Thailand and Vietnam. ", "During the quarter, integrated product management saw increased demand for services in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and North Russia geo-markets. Since the beginning of the year, integrated project management has been awarded an impressive $3.8 billion of new and extended contracts that cover project management, technology deployment, and third-party services in the regions of Latin America, Russia, North Africa, Europe, and Malaysia. Building on long-term customer relationships, these awards have increased the contracted IPM through the end of the decay to a total of $4.8 billion. The achievement of clear performance objectives as part of the long-term nature of IPM services has been key to this expansion, where increasing market acceptance of the IPM business model can be measured by the continuing performance improvement that has been achieved over a number of successive contracts. ", "Turning now to WesternGeco, pretax operating income decreased sequentially in spite of the increased activity in marine acquisition and stronger data processing sales. Vessel productivity was higher than predicted in spite of seasonal transit and scheduled dry-dock inspections. These positive results proved insufficient to counter flat land revenue that resulted from the crew costs associated with certain projects and the usual seasonal decrease in multi-client data sales. As a result, the pretax operating margins dropped to 32.5%. ", "In order to meet the increasing demand for Q technology services, the seventh Q vessel, the Western Spirit, was launched at the end of the quarter. This vessel incorporates a development to the Q technology platform known as dynamic spread control system. This system automates vessels, source and streamer steering to achieve higher levels of performance. The benefits lie in far more accurate survey positioning to yield even higher repeatability in time-lapsed applications. The new vessel has already begun work for Statoil on a 40 reservoir seismic survey in the North Sea. ", "In another technology development, we acquired Geosystem land and marine electromagnetic and seismic imaging services. Geosystem has considerable expertise in the joint inversion of multiple geophysical measurements acquired through seismic, gravity, or magnetotelluric surveys, and it will become part of WesternGeco Electromagnetics. ", "In the short-term, the future natural gas activity in North America remains uncertain, as record imports of LNG, a slower-than-forecast decline in Canadian gas production, and the backlog of wells stimulated and brought online have all led to a rapid rise in gas storage levels. In this market, pricing erosion for pressure pumping stimulation equipment accelerated during the quarter due to increasing capacity. However, we continue to believe that the high decline rates of existing fields and the poorer quality reservoirs now being drilled would ultimately lead to renewed activity in the area. ", "Global demand for oil remains robust while non-OPEC supply continues to disappoint, due largely to acceleration in the decline rates of the existing production base, delays in new and complex projects under development, and inadequate industry investment from shortages of people and equipment. ", "We remain convinced that international activity will continue to increase as operators combat production shortfalls and continue to increase expiration budgets to renew reserves. ", "I\u2019m now going to hand the call back to Malcolm. ", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Andrew. We will now open the call for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question this morning comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Andrew, with regard to the outlook for seismic, I was wondering if you could share with us what the pricing trends are at present on a leading edge basis. So for work that you are bidding into for 2008 and 2009, is pricing flat or up from where we have been? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "We still have some pricing leverage on the 2008 horizon. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed that some of the new builds have slipped. And also, if you add to that the popularity of wide-azimuth, which uses a lot of vessels, and general demand, we don\u2019t see any capacity issues in 2008. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "When you make mention of pricing leverage, does that imply -- what magnitude of pricing increase are you guys getting, relative to where you are at present? Is it double-digits? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don\u2019t know, Bill. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "Okay, and -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Quite deliberately, I didn\u2019t ask, so I can\u2019t answer your question. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "And then secondly, with regard to visibility, I\u2019ve been struck by the fact that really size of backlog has been flat for about four quarters in a row now, notwithstanding the fantastic visibility going forward. Walk me through in terms of how sold out you are with regard to 2008, and are you beginning to bid for projects in 2009? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "So the answer is we are not in any way sold out in 2008. The only thing that\u2019s happened as far as 2008 is concerned is that work that would normally have been bid at the end of the summer is being bid now. So we have visibility on a number of bids, if you like, but we don\u2019t yet have visibility on the total backlog. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "Lastly, with respect to wide-azimuth, to date wide-azimuth projects have been I think only confined to the Gulf of Mexico. Are you optimistic that wide-azimuth is going to be exported to other spheres? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "We certainly think that in any arena where there are large salt bodies, that wide-azimuth will be tested. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "Which would be where? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, it could be West Africa, it could be offshore India, it could be certain parts of the North Sea. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "Thanks very much, guys. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We do have a question now from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much. Andrew, you mentioned an impressive $3.8 billion of IPM work since the beginning of the year, and a backlog now of 4.8. This is something you\u2019ve been talking about for a long time and marketing pretty aggressively, so could you give us a little bit of flavor on whether there are new types of customers that you are now seeing embracing this for one reason or another and elaborate a little bit on how this is being widened out and accepted in the markets? We all know about a certain country where it\u2019s very ideal but to what extent is it getting wider acceptance and why? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think it is certainly getting a wider geographical acceptance than the initial concentration in Latin America. I think that it is being driven by a number of things. Firstly, I think it is being driven by our track record. Secondly, I think it is being driven by the fact that everyone is short of people and therefore short of people to manage their own projects and therefore if they can use an integrated project management offering to augment, to increase their own capacity to do work, they will do so. ", "And thirdly, there are certain types of operations where we have put together technical packages which allow us to market a technical package through IPM that is not otherwise available in the market. That\u2019s particularly the case in Russia. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Is there any trend between IOCs or larger EMPs, or national companies that are now embracing this, or is it broad-brushed? How would you characterize it? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I would say that every category you mentioned is using it in one form or another but the dominance is still through NOCs or relatively inexperienced exploration and production companies. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "I mean, 3.8 is a very big ramp by the sounds of things. Is this something unusual in this first-half or is this a -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "When I say impressive, it is because we\u2019ve never ever had a volume of work bid and won of that size in any period of time and certainly not in six months, so it is quite exceptional. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Just one follow-up question; you mentioned in Brazil you are doing the first CSCMI survey. Are you afraid in any shape or form of some of the patent allegations that are existing or do you think that you have protection on that front? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "We\u2019re not concerned by any of the current patent claims that are made by any of our competitors. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Is this your first commercial survey now? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, but this is the first commercial survey with a new boat. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We are going now to a question from the line of Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks and congratulations on a great quarter. Andrew, I\u2019d like to talk a bit about natural gas and the Middle East North Africa area. If I just look at Algeria, for example, they\u2019ve abandoned their oil production target of 2 million by 2010. They are not spending any less. They are probably spending more though and getting more aggressive in terms of the incremental spend on the natural gas side. We\u2019re seeing more capital in Saudi and Abu Dhabi and even Kuwait on the gas side. Can you talk about what that means from a P&L impact standpoint for your business and the region, how we can think about mix shift and -- ", "Scott A. Greenstein", "Firstly, I think you need to be careful to distinguish between investment in natural gas in North Africa and investment in natural gas in the Middle East. Investment in natural gas in North Africa is still very much attuned to an export market. In other words -- in the case of Algeria, as you\u2019ve seen in the last quarter, that can be gas sold into the U.S. ", "And in the case of the Middle East, the increase in gas activity is being very much driven by domestic shortages of gas for their own industrialization programs. So you are quite right. We\u2019ve seen a number of rigs diverted away from oil programs in several countries towards gas programs. ", "I would say that in the short-term, that really doesn\u2019t make a great deal of difference to us in the P&L arena except for the fact that in some of the countries, some of the gas work that\u2019s being done is gas exploration and therefore there is, if you like, probably a marginal quality effect on our revenue in the initial stages of gas development. ", "Also, a lot of the gas that\u2019s being developed is either sour or at high pressure and high temperature and therefore requires a very somewhat specialized tools and therefore, some -- and also probably a greater degree of reliability and therefore probably commands a slight premium to the company that can provide them. But you are quite right to point out there is a general trend, particularly in the Middle East, towards more gas work but it is being driven by domestic shortages. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and so I guess just continue to watch industrial growth and GDP growth in the region I guess broadly for that. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Secondly, can you help us characterize -- I mean, to be down just $0.01 sequentially in the North American region versus some of the other numbers that are likely to come out this quarter, can you characterize what it is in terms of what you are doing in North America that would lead to such differentiated performance? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, you have to, as you well know, the service mix between us and some of our competitors is not the same and therefore, they are more or less affected by the drop in natural gas drilling in Canada. ", "As I pointed out last quarter, our people did an excellent job of downsizing and therefore, they got their cost base right very early on. I would actually say that the technology increment in non-conventional gas is increasing quite rapidly. This is true in well services but it is also true in drilling and measurements and completions. Therefore, with a relatively smaller exposure to the generic market, we are probably able to hold up a bit better. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Is it fair, I think in a commoditized or what has traditionally been a commoditized market like North America, we tend to see relative performance within the lens or through the lens of market share. Is it fair to say that this is really more about technology content than just raw market share points? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think it is fair to say that there is a trend where us and some of our competitors, not just us, are bringing technology to the non-conventional gas market that improves well performance but at the same time also protects the service industry to a certain extent from the pure generic hydraulic horsepower. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning. Andrew, just along the lines of a follow-up on your mentioning getting your costs right in Canada and North America in general. I just want to know if you have taken any additional steps to reduce your exposure in North America. With other companies doing the same, are you concerned? Are you starting to see any pricing pressures internationally? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Additional steps in North America, we certainly haven\u2019t moved any equipment. We have done some organizational fine-tuning in the second quarter but nothing like on the scale of what we did in Canada in Q4 last year or the beginning of Q1 this year. ", "International, yes, we\u2019re seeing frac fleets arriving in Russia and certain other places. It\u2019s had an effect on pressure pumping pricing in the Western Siberian market but not really anywhere else yet. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, and I also had a question here on the electromagnetic market and your what looked like a bigger entry into it, this acquisition. I just wonder if you could give us some general color on what you think the market size is for those services, its strategic importance and the technological differentiation Schlumberger may bring. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think we have always taken the point of view that the CSEM, or control source electromagnetic or magnetotelluric measurement on its own standalone was not really worth a great deal. I mean, yes, it allows you to pinpoint resistivity contrasts or to define bodies better, but unless it was constrained with other measurements, notably a structural measurement and the structural measurement is seismic and others like gravity and then further from that, the inversion of the whole model for reservoir properties -- the actual individual measurements on its own was not the end game. ", "Therefore, we\u2019ve taken the point of view that you need to have the ability to make those measurements but the real value is in constraining them with each other and then making interpretations. And I think you\u2019ve seen some of our seismic competitors make moves in the recent weeks which take you very much along the same line of thought. In other words, you need the measurement but it\u2019s basically each measurement constraining the other that\u2019s going to make the difference. ", "And what is the overall size of the market? I actually don\u2019t think we know. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything like some of the numbers that have been tossed around but it is undoubtedly reasonably large. If you can produce a better image with some definition of hydrocarbon presence from constraining seismic with CSEM and other measurements, it obviously increases the value-added of the seismic you produce. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Great. Thanks, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Crandell with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Congratulations, Andrew, and I\u2019d also like to congratulate JF on his promotion, if he\u2019s on the line. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "He\u2019s here, Jim. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Congratulations, JF. I have a couple of questions and I\u2019ll ask them both here and then listen to your answers on each of them. On the U.S. land stimulation market, first of all, Andrew, my question is capacity growth in U.S. land stimulation second-half versus first-half, companies like FracTech and Tritan still seem like they are adding equipment but others have stopped. Do you see a slowing in the rate of capacity additions here? ", "Secondly, do you think the combined effect of demand growth, retirements, the booming equipment internationally, will be able to offset the continued creep up in capacity and cause prices to stabilize soon? ", "Thirdly, how currently do you see prices on contract rollovers that will take place later this year for 2008? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "So on the first question, yes, we are aware that certain equipment orders have been cancelled. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything yet that makes us feel that the reduction in new capacity is to the point where it is going to affect our original thinking on pricing in the second-half of the year. ", "Secondly, retiring equipment, moving equipment overseas, a gradual increase in activity in North America, when is that going to bring the market into balance and allow pricing to stabilize -- I have to say, Jim, I don\u2019t know because so much depends on Canada. While I don\u2019t think Canada will stay down forever, I can\u2019t judge whether it\u2019s this year or next that it turns back up. You\u2019ve seen what the operators have said but operators can change their minds very fast. ", "The third thing in contract rollovers, we have seen price erosion in the second quarter more in the spot market than in the contract market, but if I was an operator I would wait for the second-half year to do my contract rollovers because there is going to be more capacity in the market, so I don\u2019t think we know the answer yet as to how far or how much pricing could be hurt in the second-half. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "But you would think that rollovers -- in general, would you think would be lower pricing for \u201908 versus \u201907? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "That\u2019s why they\u2019re waiting. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Is that what you think? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Oh, yes. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, good. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Dan Pickering with Pickering Energy Partners. Please go ahead. ", "Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "Good morning. I apologize, I\u2019ve got a cold here. Andrew, as we looked at the second quarter, obviously very strong margins and I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything in the quarter that we should view as unusual or if this is kind of a new baseline as we step forward for the second-half of the year in terms of profitability -- any place where you would expect to see softer profitability in the second-half of the year? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think it would be unfortunate if you took MEA -- Middle East Asia -- as a baseline because the service mix -- very strong exploration campaigns in Asia means that the quality of revenue mix in Asia was exceptionally good in Q1 and in Q2 and I can\u2019t promise that that will repeat every quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you saw a little fluctuation up and down in Middle East Asia. I think in North America, I would love to think that the margin decline is over but given what I just said about pressure pumping, I would be amazed if it doesn\u2019t drop a little more. ", "In Europe, Africa there is some seasonality effect in the margin improvement because you have Russia coming back, you have a very busy season in the North Sea which you know, basically only starts in the beginning of summer. But generally, I think they have the best chance of sustaining or improving still. ", "Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I think you answered this question somewhat but can you help us understand the magnitude of Canada\u2019s impact on this particular quarter? You muted it, it sounds like, with cost control but I\u2019m just trying to understand how well the U.S. did based on what Canada did. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, the Canadian rig count was down by 60% and sequentially -- just let me look at the sheet here. Sequentially, you are looking at a huge change in revenue, much more than the normal seasonal change. So the U.S. in fact did very well to make up for almost all of that. I would point out that I think even we were surprised by the strength of U.S. land and we were certainly -- we were helped by the Gulf Coast switching back more to a drilling mode than a completion mode and also the continuation of exploration activity in Alaska. ", "Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "Andrew, do you think you took share in the U.S. in the quarter? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don\u2019t think so, Dan, no. ", "Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "Okay. Fantastic. Thank you. Good quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question then from the line of Brad Handler with Wachovia Securities. Please go ahead. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities", "Thanks. Good morning. I guess I\u2019m going to wind up touching on a couple of the same topics but I just want to be clear that I\u2019m in the sense reading some of what you\u2019ve written here correctly. Since you\u2019ve listed U.S. land first in terms of sequential revenue increases, is it fair to say we\u2019re talking about 15% or better sequential growth in U.S. land in the quarter? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "We didn\u2019t say it was the largest. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities", "No, yeah, I don\u2019t want to over read. I mean, you listed it first -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think you are reading too much into it, Brad. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities", "All right. That\u2019s -- I just asked if you would clarify that for me. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we listed it first but it\u2019s by no means the largest sequential increase, by no manner of means. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. And then if I switch gears to IPM, perhaps I could just ask for a little bit more detail with respect to a couple of the aspects. For example, can you share either the mix of third party services versus your own provision of services? And If you could comment on the progression, which I understand is a longer term progression but the progression of drilling versus production-related work. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "So there is no doubt that the progression in the $3.8 billion is very largely drilling work because that\u2019s where people are really short of capability. There is some production but not nearly on the scale of the drilling. ", "In terms of the split between third-party revenues, project management revenues, and Schlumberger technology-related revenues, the ratios are roughly the same as they\u2019ve always been. We will help you guys on that going forward for your modeling, as we did previously. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities", "If I could slip in one more, please; there has been talk out there with respect to your presence with partner [Valerik] with respect to intelligent pipe. I know it\u2019s sort of a small topic but can you make any comment on your pending presence in that area? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we are working with [Valerik]. I don\u2019t think I want to make any comment on when we will be testing and offering. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia Securities", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Thanks very much. I guess really the last question I had was if you could quantify at all the magnitude of the pricing erosion that you are seeing in the U.S. stimulation market, maybe what you are thinking it might be in the second-half? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "On the second-half, Geoff, I honestly don\u2019t know. We have seen I think an acceleration in the second quarter to the point where I don\u2019t know but I would estimate it\u2019s close to double-digits -- not double-digits, but close to. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "You\u2019ve mentioned before that a large fraction of your U.S. stimulation business is on contract. Could you just elaborate a little bit in terms of how does that work in terms of giving Schlumberger a differential protection against pricing erosion? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think that it\u2019s fair to say that the pressure pumping companies who work on contract have a greater degree of protection in the first-half of this year and the difficulty that we will have along with some of our competitors who are also on fairly long-term contracts, is in the contract renewal in the second-half of the year. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "And typically, would you expect those rollovers to move to spot pricing? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, not necessarily. Spot pricing can vary even more. Spot pricing can go lower. If there\u2019s no spot market, spot pricing can go even lower. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "And you made a comment that kind of surprised me earlier in regards to the increasing technological content of the unconventional reservoir development. Can you talk at all about how you see -- I mean, you are being reasonably sort of negative about the outlook for pricing but on the other hand, you seem to be saying that there\u2019s some structural developments going on that are likely to offset that. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, I think there\u2019s a segmentation in the pressure pumping market between those people who can only pump and people who can provide a completion solution together with their pressure pumping. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "And the relative size of the market from a demand perspective, that last category -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think we\u2019re proving, we\u2019re in the process of proving that the technical solution which combines the completion with the pressure pumping adds value to the well, the non-conventional horizontal gas well. I think the market is quite small at the moment but growing quite fast. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Okay and just a clarification in terms of you talk about a backlog of well -- I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you meant by a backlog. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, as you know, the reason the spot market for stimulation has been so strong is that you have wells drilled and completed but waiting to be perforated and stimulated. So those wells, as they come online, they bring on new production even though they may have been drilled two months ago. So as long as there is a spot market for a backlog in stimulation, there is gas production behind pipe where the wells have already been drilled. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Is your sense that that backlog has increased or decreased over the last -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we think it\u2019s decreasing at the moment. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Okay. Great, thanks very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Michael Urban with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. I wanted to jump down to Latin America and talk about Venezuela a little bit. You were able to resolve some of the contract issues down there and that helped the quarter a little bit. Going forward though it looks like Venezuela is going to need to ramp up activity, and there\u2019s actually as we\u2019re on the call here a story going across the tape about them cutting the original number of rigs but that actually implies a 50% increase from where they actually are. ", "Going forward, would you anticipate ramping up your activity there or bidding on new work, or are you taking a little more cautious view of the market? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we are very happy, more than happy with our current relationship with PDVSA and we are perfectly prepared to invest if they invite us to tender for work. ", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank", "Is that something that you are seeing, because again the rig count comments and we\u2019ve spent a little time with them ourselves, would suggest that they -- now that they are kind of through the nationalization program that they are going to need to and in fact actually go ahead and start to ramp up work maybe in the second-half but certainly \u201908. Is that consistent with -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "We are certainly hearing talk of plans for a greater scope of work going forward, yes. ", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank", "But it hasn\u2019t really translated into anything in terms of contracts or activity yet? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "For individual services, yes, but for large new programs, not really -- not yet, no. ", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. That\u2019s all for me. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Ken Sill with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Good morning, Andrew. I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the IPM. You guys used to tell us about how big that was as a percentage of revenue. Is that something you are prepared to let us know now or something we should talk about offline? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think it\u2019s something we\u2019ll come to fairly shortly. We\u2019re still sorting our way through all this before we decide how we formulate it for you because we want a formula for everybody that\u2019s easy to understand. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s fair enough. And then, I guess my question though, big backlog, I would imagine that\u2019s going to flow through gradually but is that because the [pass] are going to start putting some pressure? Maybe your growth is a little bit better than we were thinking but the margins come in a little bit lower? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Certainly in Latin America there will be some acceleration of the growth and to the extent that a large part of it is third-party services, there may be some slight overall margin reduction but there\u2019s certainly no problem with the profitability of the Schlumberger services included. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Because it seems like you\u2019ve done really well here in the second-half. International is doing quite well on a year-over-year basis, so is there really any change to your guidance from say Q4, Q1 of 20% plus top line growth and low 40s incremental margins? Or is it -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, no, I think we just feel a lot more comfortable about it. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Okay, so no change. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Not really. I mean, I would say the uncertainty there in my mind when I talk about that overall top line number is not overseas. It\u2019s what happens in North America. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "And then a final question on seismic and multi-client. We\u2019ve got a couple of lease sales coming here in August and October. Are you guys seeing a lot of activity related to those lease sales and do you expect a multi-client to pick up substantially in Q3? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Let me just say that we think that second-half seismic will be better than first-half seismic. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Well that\u2019s pretty good. Thank you, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Alan Laws with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ", "Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Exploration service integration kind of continues to be a theme through the quarterly reports. Just a question on the integration of services; can you talk a little bit about the trends here? You\u2019re integrating the drilling and the wireline and the seismic for your one earth model that I think you\u2019ve talked about a lot in the past and now you add stimulation. Are these broadening the one earth model or are these more discrete combinations for certain projects? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think you have to take a very different view if you are talking about SIS and the Petrel seismic to simulation modeling capability because that model would accept data from anybody, not just Schlumberger. ", "In terms of bidding of exploration services, actually I think probably what we are seeing is that due to people shortages around the globe on certain exploration packages, people are asking us to manage and integrate our own services. But I would say that it\u2019s a fairly small phenomenon at this point in time. ", "Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch", "So it\u2019s -- right now, it\u2019s a people leveraging phenomenon and it\u2019s mostly exploration related as far as its pick-up? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. ", "Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and on a competitive basis, are you -- how are you positioned here versus your peers in your ability? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "In as much as we\u2019re the only company who has all those services in-house, that is to say particularly seismic, D&N, wireline, and well testing, obviously that gives you more leverage to be efficient in your integration than perhaps people who have to do it from different companies because that\u2019s what traditionally the operators would have done. ", "Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch", "I have one other small one here left on my list -- a lot of talk in the report on artificial lift. How would you rate your share in artificial lift in the recent quarters? Do you think it\u2019s picking up? Is it the same? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, you know, Spears has us changing position between number one and number two in electrical submersible pumps and I actually don\u2019t -- I honestly don\u2019t know whether we are number one or number two in any particular quarter, because it changes constantly between us and our major competitor. So the answer is I don\u2019t know, it changes all the time. ", "Alan Laws - Merrill Lynch", "All right. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns", "Thank you. Andrew, I was wanting to pursue a little further your comment that on the slower-than-forecast decline in Canadian gas production, which has puzzled me as well, I just wondered if you could explain what you think might be behind the slower decline in Canadian production, given the huge drop in drilling. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Actually, I think and I absolutely can\u2019t guarantee this, Robin, my feeling is that some of the delays in the heavy oil site B projects mean that less gas is being used in heavy oil production than people were anticipating. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns", "Okay, so production then is sort of declining but the export availability is still the same or perhaps greater? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "It hasn\u2019t been affected to the extent that people probably thought it would be. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns", "And then my follow-up is on the winter season in Canada, which -- when would you -- I guess that\u2019s probably the most realistic timeframe in which we could see a change in the current depressed environment but when would you begin to see an indication of activity levels for the next winter drilling season there? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Towards the end of the third quarter, I would say. They can turn it on and off very, very fast, as we\u2019ve seen. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns", "Right. Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak. Please go ahead. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "Thank you. A couple of questions, Andrew, first on IPM; is that all fixed -- maybe a couple of aspects of that. One, is that all fixed price business? Is there some -- would there be any risk of cost overruns as we\u2019ve seen or do you think you guys have it right now in terms of pricing? And then, is there any performance aspect to the pricing, or how much of that 3.8 has performance aspects to it, where you get an increment if you produce, if you hit certain production benchmarks or beat benchmarks? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "The production content is low so this is mostly well construction. So a lot of is lump sum. Because of the current market conditions, a lot of our pricing and costs are indexed so we can pass through a lot of it. As in any very large drilling project, there is a risk but I think this has worked generally, we know pretty well, and that certainly as I\u2019ve emphasized in the last couple of presentations I\u2019ve made, the system within IPM now to evaluate projects and bid is probably an order of magnitude more sophisticated than it was when we had the accident in 2004, so I\u2019m pretty confident that we\u2019re okay. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "Okay, and is there still similar amounts behind the pipe or whatever -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "They\u2019re probably not totally similar but there are still large projects that are under-bid, yes, Kevin. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "That you\u2019ll pick up and that will come in 2H? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes, I doubt we\u2019ll have half-years like that every half-year, but you know, there\u2019s still plenty of stuff. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "And then just one other; you\u2019ve been talking about a shift ultimately to more exploration which obviously is very differentially positive for your company. Do you think you are beginning to actually see that, even with rig constraints out there? Or is that really going to still be really a this is just unusual what happened and -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we are seeing it but we\u2019re not seeing it to nearly the extent that we probably will once the new builds start to hit, particularly the deep water new builds start to hit the market. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "And so if you -- I know you don\u2019t want us to run ahead of ourselves with margins. You\u2019ve done a good job of keeping us suppressed, or at least some of us suppressed, based on consensus but shouldn\u2019t that tilt margins higher for your oilfield business away from North America, which has its own dynamic? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well to the extent that the expiration quotient in any one quarter is higher, then it has a very positive margin effect, which is what we\u2019ve just seen in Asia in the last two quarters. It\u2019s undoubtedly had an effect in places like the North Sea in the second quarter. But for it to be more general, Kevin, and to go much further than where it is, we need more rigs. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "But we know those are coming, and so -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes, but they are 2009 events, a lot of them. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "Okay. Thanks, that\u2019s it for me. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We have a question now from the line of William Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead. ", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Good morning, Andrew. Andrew, you spent a lot of time talking about over-capacity in the pressure pumping market in North America. I\u2019m curious if you are seeing any over-capacity surface in any of your other product lines and is it causing you any concern as we move to the back-half of \u201907? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we are not seeing -- apart from pressure pumping, we\u2019re not seeing any over-capacity in the product lines that we participate in. ", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay, and Canada for the second quarter, did you see any pricing erosion outside of pressure pumping to speak of or strictly pricing-related in pressure pumping than volume declines? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, in Canada the market was so low there was pricing erosion pretty much across the board. ", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Across the board, okay. Thank you, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Thank you. We are showing a follow-up from the line of James Crandell with Lehman Brothers, and unfortunately, this is going to be our last question of the day. Please go ahead. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Andrew, I had two questions about the non-North American growth outlook in 2008 relative to 2007. Number one, what is your conviction that growth in Saudi and Russia will slow in 2008 versus 2007 and the way you see it now, given that there\u2019s so many areas that seem to be increasing and given IPM and other things. What do you think that the odds are that there are enough offsets so that international growth overall in \u201908 could continue at present levels? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Firstly, I don\u2019t have any concern about Russia, Jim. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "I thought you were concerned about the election and slowing going into the election. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, no, I think that there may be -- it may be quite uncertain through the end of the year but I don\u2019t have any doubt that Russia will spend next year. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "And on Saudi, yes, I think that absent new plans from the Saudis, that the rig count is going to plateau and therefore the growth is going to plateau. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. How about overall? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think overall it\u2019s very early to say but with the visibility we have today, I\u2019ll not say we can match the growth rate of this year overseas but we certainly will still have significant growth.

At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to the management team if they do have any closing comments.

Welcome to today\u2019s third quarter 2007 conference call. Beforewe begin today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to review the logistics and agenda. Some of theinformation in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, as well asnon-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other importantinformation are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.

Finally, we\u2019ll take questions from the audience. ", "Now Simon Ayat will discuss the financials. ", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentleman, good morning and thank you forparticipating in this conference call. Third quarter net income was $1.09 pershare, up $0.07 sequentially, and $0.28 above the same quarter of last year.Oil field services generated $1.5 billion in pre-tax operating income; flat withthe second quarter but declined in margin terms by 108 basis points to 29.4%. ", "By area, the highlights were as follows: North America pre-tax margindeclined 427 basis points sequentially, to 26.9%, due to weather-relateddisruption in the Gulf of Mexico, the continued erosion of pressure pumpingstimulation pricing on land in the U.S., and a reduction of explorationactivity in the Alaska, partly compensated by a rebound in Canada after thesecond quarter spring break-up.", "Latin America pre-tax margin increased 10 basispoints sequentially to 23.7%, reflecting the improved margins in the Mexicoand Central America, and Peru,Colombia, Ecuadorgeomarkets. The improvement in the Mexicoand Central America geomarket was a result of thecontinued ramp up of new IPM projects that more than offset the projectsstart-up costs. ", "For ECA -- the Europe, CIS, Africaarea -- the pre-tax margin improved 50 basis points sequentially to 29.2% with Russiaexperiencing a seasonally high offshore Sakhalin,and on land in Eastern Siberia, and a strong performancein the North Africa geomarket. This was partly offset by project delays inthe Caspian and Nigeria,and Libya wheremargins came under pressure.", "Middle East/Asia pre-tax margin increased 38 basis points sequentially, to35.7% on improvement in China,Japan, Korea,Australia and New  Zealand, Papua  New Guinea and Indonesiageomarkets, with continued exploration activity, while margins in the Middle East geomarkets remained steady. WesternGeco\u2019s pre-tax income was$306 million, with a sequential margin improvement of 611 basis points, to38.6%. ", "Marine margins improved with the introduction of the seventh Q vessel,higher utilization following the seasonal transit and dry docks in the previousquarter, and better prices. Dataprocessing also improved as a result of increased activity associated with themarine operations. This was partly offset by slower multi-client sales, mainlyin North America. ", "Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole; the effective tax rate was 20.8%,1.5 percentage points lower than last quarter, mainly due to the lowerproportion of pre-tax earnings in North America for both OFS and WesternGeco. ", "Four quarter ETR is expected to be slightly higher than the current quarterlevel, and will continue to be impacted by the geographic mix of earnings. Theearnings for the quarter included $32 million of expenses related tostock-based compensation, as compared to $34 million in the previous quarter.We expect this expense for the full year 2007 to be approximately $135 million,a $21 million increase over 2006. ", "As of September 30, net debt was $1.7 billion, significant liquidity events duringthe quarter included $293 million for a stock buy-back program; CapEx,including multi-client, of $790 million; and funding of the U.S.pension by an additional $150 million.", "CapEx, excluding $72 million of multi-client surveys capitalized, was $718million for the quarter and is expected to reach approximately $3 billion forthe year 2007.", "During the quarter, we bought back 3.1 million shares for $293 million, atan average price of $93.62. This brings the total share buyback under the 40million share repurchase program announced in April, 2006 to 24.1 millionshares for $1.6 billion at an average price of $66.93 per share. ", "Now I turn the conference over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould", "Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Growth in the third quarter wasdriven by international activity across a number of geomarkets in Latin America and in Russia,as well as by activity in China/Japan/Korea, Indonesiaand the Gulf in the Middle Eastern/Asia area. ", "In North America, activity increased in Canada,but this was offset by weaker pricing for pressure pumping on land in the U.S.,and by a sharp revenue drop in the Gulf of Mexico, dueto the departure of several rigs to overseas locations, and a loss ofapproximately 15 operating days due to weather. ", "Among our technology, growth was strongest at WesternGeco as the segmentrecovered from dry docks and vessel transits in the second quarter. Marineacquisition revenue for the quarter reached an all-time record, as pricing firmedand advanced Q technology acquisition techniques continued to be deployed. Inother technologies, growth was led by robust IPM activity and by demand for wirelineand drilling and measurements services, particularly in overseas markets. ", "Looking at the areas in more detail, within North Americasequential revenue in the Canadageomarket rebounded on a higher rig count, led by demand for well services and wirelinetechnologies, following the seasonal spring break up. However, this was morethan offset by slowdowns in the U.S. Gulf Coast, as operators adoptedprecautionary measures during the hurricane season, with the approach ofvarious weather systems; and by capacity-driven pricing erosion in pressurepumping stimulation services in all three U.S.land geomarkets. Lower exploration activity and seasonal maintenance in Alaskaalso contributed to this reduction. ", "In Latin America, sequential revenue growth wasprimarily driven by a continuing ramp-up in integrated project managementactivity; although the higher rig count, together with stronger demand fordrilling and measurements, artificial lift systems; and Schlumberger\u2019sInformation Solutions Technologies in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador geomarket, alsocontributed to growth.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa,sequential growth was driven by a strong performance in Russia.This resulted from a number of positive factors that included seasonally highactivity on land and offshore in East Russia; increaseddemand for IPM services and artificial lift products in South Russia;higher demand for drilling and measurements technologies in North Russia; as well as the impact of the consolidation of Tyumenpromgeofizika.", "Elsewhere in the area, increased demand for new technology, drilling andmeasurement services in North Africa, higher artificiallift product sales in continental Europe, and higherwireline activity in West and Southern Africa also droveresults. Overall sequential growth, however, was tempered by project slowdownsin Nigeria andin the Caspian. ", "Within the Middle East and Asia,sequential growth resulted from higher activity in the China/Japan/Korea, Indonesia,Australia/Papua/New Guinea, India,Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines and Gulf geomarkets. This was partially offset bylower activity in Qatarand the Thailand/Vietnam geomarket. ", "Advanced technology uptake continues as demand for new wireline technologieswas driven by the need for more accurate formation evaluation. New wirelinescanner deployments included high-pressure, high-temperature applications inthe U.S. Gulf of Mexico used for thin bed and laminated sand analysis in the U.S.and West Africa, and for evaluation of additionalnatural gas production in Mexico.Worldwide Scanner jobs have now exceeded 1,500 with more than 300 tools activethroughout the geomarket organization.", "Drilling and measurement scope services also continued their worldwideexpansion, with PeriScope imaging while drilling jobs in China, and TeleScopehigh-speed telemetry in combination with StethoScope formation pressure welldrilling technology on operations in Qatar, Brunei and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.", "The shift towards more complex operations was highlighted during the quarterby a number of technical successes. Deeper reservoirs with consequent higherpressures and higher temperatures were logged with advanced high technologyservices, while new contracts were signed for deepwater projects in severalregions. ", "IPM strengthened as the new Mexican projects ramped up. Current projectspassed important milestones and geographic expansion increased in growingmarkets in newer regions. Among the more active projects, IPM operationsincreased in geomarkets in the Europe, CIS and Africa;while the contribution made by the well construction business in Latin Americangenerally continued to grow. ", "Turning now to WesternGeco, marine acquisition revenues increased throughhigher vessel utilization, following the seasonal transits and scheduled drydock inspections seen in the prior quarter. In addition the seventh Q vessel, theWestern Spirit which was launched in Q2, was fully active. Strong demand formarine seismic also led to improved pricing for both conventional and Q marinesurveys. Among the other WesternGeco products lines, data processing increased,driven primarily by higher sales in Europe, North America and Asia, while land activityremained flat and multi-client declined. ", "In the immediate future, while there will be some recovery from the lowactivity levels in the Gulf of Mexico, natural gas activity in both Canada andthe U.S. is likely to stabilize as production remains relatively strong and gasstorage approaches winter at comfortable levels. ", "As a result, pressure pumping pricing deterioration will continue. Thissituation, however, does not change our view that North American natural gassupply will require sustained activity to combat production decline, andadvanced technology to increase production rates from poorer qualityreservoirs.", "Overseas, growth will continue at varying rates between regions, due to theeffects of winter weather and project delays in certain countries. ", "Global demand for oil remains strong, while non-OPEC production continues todisappoint.

So far I think pricingdeterioration is still single-digit compared to last year. I think it willaccelerate slightly in Q4. Where the bottom is I really don\u2019t know, becausewhat we have is a situation very different from 2001, in that the bottom is going tobe created by additional capacity and not by a drop in the rig count. Because Iused the word stabilized quite consciously, in that we think at the currentlevel of storage, with the current production profile, rig count is likely toremain flat or go up or down a little bit, but basically not change very much.", "So what is going to change the pricing profile is the additional capacity.

I think in the case ofother countries, it\u2019s really just a question of logistical difficultiesbecoming more and more complex and therefore perhaps the rate of growth thatpeople have been expecting from certain countries, while the growth will bethere, it\u2019s not going to be quite as fast as they imagine.

Maybe we missed a tactical opportunity, but we didn't see the run up.", "Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan", "Secondly on currency, currency issues have come up in the past and we'vetalked about the business being dollar neutral and revenues and costs beingvery much dollar linked. The question I have is more to cost of livingadjustments for ex-pats that are being paid in dollars. Is there any risk wecould see some real inflation in wages next year for those kinds ofadjustments?", "Andrew Gould", "I think you have to take into account there are two types of ex-pats. Sothere are ex-pats who rotate. An example would be WesternGeco crews or testingcrews who actually live in a country where they pay their bills in euros orpounds or whatever it happens to be, and we have always based our salaries indollars. For those people, over the last two years, we have already been makingcost-of-living adjustments to take account of the devaluation of the dollar. ", "Then you have our permanently assigned expatriate personnel who live in thecountries where they work and who are paid in dollars and remunerated on a basesalary and on a cost-of-living coefficient -- all in dollars -- and thatpopulation, if there continues to be a serious decline in the dollar, we willhave to address it, yes. Yes, that will cause a little cost inflation.", "Michael LaMotte - JP Morgan", "Can you give a sense in terms of the mix of employee base?", "Andrew Gould", "Not off the top of my head, Michael, no, but the vast majority are in dollarterms.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup. ", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "You mentioned, Andrew, that you had always factored in some delays in termsof rig deliveries in your rig outlook. Can you give us some idea of averagedelay versus the stated delivery dates that you've been using?", "Andrew Gould", "Actually that's not the one I worry about. I think the operating efficiencyof a rig in its first year with a new crew, new out of the shipyard, is vastlyinferior to an existing offshore rig that has a well-honed crew and has beendrilling wells for years. So it's not so much the delay from the shipyard asthe actual drilling efficiency in the first year or two of operations.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Would you be using like a 50% factor or like an 80% factor?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think we're that scientific about it, but it would be a prettysubstantial factor, Geoff, yes.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "The second one was in your comments about Europe/CIS/Africaand the greater size of the weather and seasonal dependent markets. All otherthings being equal, will the potential declines in the fourth quarter causemargins to vary significantly? I mean, there's a mix effect kind of implied inyour comment.", "Andrew Gould", "Significantly, no. Very, yes. But not the sort of thing you've seen with theGulf of Mexico stoppages if that is what you are thinking, Geoff.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "So it would be negative but not very large.", "Andrew Gould", "No. If you take Sakhalin as it's a seasonal shutdown,we can adjust cost accordingly.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "So you can anticipate, right?", "Andrew Gould", "It's when you get a stoppage where a stoppage is unforeseen or brief thatyou cannot adjust cost that you get the accelerated market effect.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "I guess what I was asking perhaps was whether those more seasonal of marketstypically carry higher margins than the average for the region or lowermarkets?", "Andrew Gould", "That would probably be a fair statement.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Jim Crandell \u2013 Lehman Brothers.", "Jim Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Andrew, our data is showing that non-North American CapEx on E&P thisyear will be up close to 25% in '07. Assuming that you believe it, do youbelieve that '08 growth over '07 can be as strong as '07 versus '06?", "Andrew Gould", "The announced CapEx numbers?", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "I am just saying that based on our survey and then adjustments to our surveysince it's come out is showing growth of close to 25% in '07. I'm asking youwhether you believe that or not, I guess, do you think that '08 versus '07 willmatch that, exceed it, fall short of that, in terms of a global growth rateoutside of North America?", "Andrew Gould", "I actually suspect that it will at least match. Now what is the inflationcontent in that 25% in '07, I don't know how you measure that. What it will bein '08, I don't know either, but I would not be at all surprised if the rawnumbers match or exceed.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "What do you see as the regions that could grow faster than 25%?", "Andrew Gould", "I think Latin America and parts of the Far East and Russia.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Citigroup", "You have your three major competitors internationally all in various stagesof building up their IPM or bundled services capability. They've all ramped upCapEx. They've all ramped up infrastructure spending. They have a lot of newtools and services entering into the market. ", "In markets that you've dominated technically or because you just have verystrong shares historically, what kind of issues does this create forSchlumberger? Do you still believe that technically speaking you're as farahead of the competition as you've ever been and doesn't really create anysignificant challenges?", "Andrew Gould", "Obviously having more capacity on the ground creates more challenges. Justbecause people have put equipment there doesn't mean that they can operateefficiently. There is obviously more threat than there used to be. Do we feelmassively under threat? Not at all.", "Operator", "We'll turn it back to Mr. Theobald.

", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Rod. Welcome to today\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2007 results conference call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to review the logistics and agenda. ", "Some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. ", "For today\u2019s agenda, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer, will begin with commentary on the financial results. And then Andrew Gould, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the fourth quarter and full year activity and outlook. Finally, we\u2019ll take questions from the audience. ", "And now, Simon Ayat will discuss the financials. ", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning and thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter net income was $1.11 per share excluding the $0.01 gain from the sale of four oil rigs in Russia, up $0.02 sequentially and $0.19 above the same quarter of last year. ", "Oilfield services Q4 activity growth was strong at 6.2% sequentially, helped by artificial lift and completions product sales. In addition, there was increased third quarter revenue on IPM projects. ", "WesternGeco reported very strong multi-client sales. However, this was offset by the seasonal drop in the high margin marine activity due to vessel transits and dry docks. ", "Oilfield services generated $1.5 billion in pretax operating income, up $30 million from the third quarter but margins declined by 116 basis points to 28.2%. By area, oilfield services highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis. ", "North America pretax margin declined 151 basis points to 25.4% due to continued erosion of pressure pumping stimulation pricing in the U.S. land market and weather related operational restrictions in the Rockies. This was partly compensated by increased activity in Canada and a better quarter in the Gulf of Mexico, where the gradual return of drilling rigs after last quarter\u2019s hurricane season. ", "Latin America processor margin was 158 basis points lower to reach 22.1%. Activity on margins improved in all geo-markets with the exception of the Mexico Central America geo-market, where revenue increased but the impact of the flooding in Mexico, project start-up costs and increased third party revenue negatively impacted the overall Latin America margins. ", "For ECA, the Europe, CIS, Africa area, the pretax margin declined 130 basis points to 27.9%, as Russia exhibited the seasonal slowdown at the beginning of the winter season of offshore [settling]. Strong activity was reported in the North Sea, Caspian, and Continental Europe geo-markets. ", "Middle East Asia pretax margin increased by $36 million but in percentage terms declined by 65 basis points to 35%. Improvements were recorded in the Arabian geo-market with higher equipment sales and overall increased activity in both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. ", "The India geo-market benefited from strong deepwater exploration activity and in Asia, improvement in the China, Japan, Korea were offset by declines in the Thailand, Vietnam geo-market on reduced exploration. ", "WesternGeco pretax income was $272 million, with a sequential drop in margin by 452 basis points to 34.1%. Marine activity and margins dropped as a result of the seasonal repositioning of the fleet with increased transit time and dry docks. The reduction in marine margins could not be compensated by the surge in multi-client sales. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 20.4%, slightly lower than last quarter, reflecting the continued shift of activity from North America to the rest of the world. In 2008, we expect the effective tax rate to remain in the low 20s. However, there may be some quarterly volatility due to the geographic mix of activity. ", "The earnings for the quarter included $33 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation costs in line with the previous quarter. We expect this expense for the full year 2008 to be approximately $108 million, a $44 million increase over 2007. ", "At year-end, net debt was $1.9 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $557 million for the stock buy-back program; $984 million for CapEx, including multi-client; and $699 million for the Eastern Echo transaction.", "CapEx excluding $65 million dollar of multi-client surveys capitalized was $919 million for the quarter, reaching $2.9 billion for total year 2007. ", "CapEx for 2008 is expected to be $3.8 billion, including $2.9 billion for oilfield services and $870 million for WesternGeco, of which $365 million is for the vessels acquired through the Eastern Echo transactions. ", "During the quarter, we bought back 5.8 million shares for $557 million at an average price of $95.65. This brings the total share buy-back under the 40 million share repurchase program announced in April \u201906 to 29.9 million shares for $2.2 billion at an average price of $72.53 per share. ", "The Board of Directors approved a 20% dividend increase, representing a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share, reflecting the positive long-term outlook. ", "And now I turn the conference over to Andrew. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Schlumberger revenues in 2007 grew by 21%, driven by strong demand for oilfield services, particularly in the overseas areas where year-on-year growth reached 31% in Middle East and Asia, 30% in Europe, CIS, Africa, 29% in Latin America. By contrast, North America remained essentially flat with 2006. ", "All technologies showed double-digit improvement, with drilling and measurements, well testing, and integrated product management recording the highest overall growth rates. ", "In the fourth quarter, strong sequential growth contributed significantly to this overall performance. However, the quarter\u2019s results were impacted by a number of events that resulted in less-than-satisfactory margins. These included a less favorable oilfield services revenue mix with lower pricing and well stimulation related activities on land in the United States; a number of exceptional and seasonal weather effects in the U.S., Mexico, the North Sea, and Russia; the expensing of significant start-up costs associated with the IPM Mezosoico and Alianza projects in Mexico, where the second half of 2007 saw integrated product management mobilize and start 17 drilling rigs within the scope of these projects; an increased marine utilization of the WesternGeco fleet through vessel transit and dry dock inspections that overweighed a sequential 83% in multi-client sales. ", "However, with the exception of the pricing for well stimulation related activities on land in the U.S., these events were largely seasonal and do not reflect any change in the underlying trends. ", "Looking at the quarter in more detail, the sequential growth of 3% in North America was led by the Canada geo-market with increased demand for well services and wireline technologies; activity partially recovered from the hurricane season in the U.S. Gulf Coast with higher demand from wireline, well testing, and well services activities; and SIS product sales were higher across the North America area. ", "However, this largely positive performance was offset by continuing price erosion in well stimulation related activities in U.S. land geo-markets, as well as by seasonal land access constraints in the west and lower activity in Alaska. ", "In Latin America, sequential growth reached 9% overall and was seen in all geo-markets, primarily driven by IPM activities in Mexico and Central America, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago. ", "Increased demand for well testing technologies and higher artificial lift and completion systems product sales in Latin America South, together with increased artificial lift and completion systems product sales in Mexico, Central America and Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, contributed to these results. ", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, the sequential growth of 4% was driven by the North Sea geo-market, with increased demand for wireline and well services technologies, together with higher artificial lift systems and SIS product sales. ", "Greater demand for drilling and measurements in the Caspian geo-market, increased sales of artificial lift in North Russia, and high demand for drilling measurements, well services and well testing in Continental Europe contributed to growth. ", "Performance was partially offset by the usual seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin and continuing subdued activity in Nigeria. ", "The Middle East Asia are recorded double-digit sequential growth of 10% as the Arabian geo-market saw high demand for drilling and measurements and wireline services, as well as higher completions and artificial lift systems and SIS product sales. ", "Sequential growth was also driven by a higher demand for exploration related drilling and measurements technologies and artificial lift systems in Qatar; increased demand for drilling and measurements and well testing services in China, Japan, Korea; and higher deepwater exploration driven demand for wireline, drilling and measurements technologies, together with SIS product sales in India. ", "Among oilfield services technologies, both well services and completion systems made significant progress during the quarter. New well services technologies, including members of the contact family of stage fracturing and completion services penetrated further into a number of key markets with a broad range of efficient and effective stimulation services. ", "In North America, StimMAP and AbrasiFRAC technologies saw greater interest and activity where their respective abilities to place fracturing treatments more accurately and to treat all productive sands in a single operation led to increased production at lower cost.", "AbrasiFRAC technology was also deployed in Saudi Arabia for Saudi Aramco, where coil tubing was used to apply the treatment in a natural gas well to result in an increase of production ten-fold. ", "Elsewhere in Saudi Arabia, StageFRAC technology was evaluated on two natural gas wells where improved production rates and increased estimates at ultimate recovery led to plans for further deployment in future horizontal gas wells. ", "Completion systems secured a significant contract for the Reslink ResFlow, passive in-flow completion technology in addition to increased sales in the quarter. This award followed tests by Saudi Aramco in both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs that showed excellent correlation between the production logging program and simulations developed by Saudi Aramco and Schlumberger. This success came just 12 months after the acquisition of Reslink by Schlumberger. ", "WesternGeco full year 2007 revenues increased 20% over 2006, while pretax operating income grew by 31%. Q-Technology revenues reached $1.14 billion, up 57% versus 2006. Overall vessel utilization for the full year was 93%. ", "The fourth quarter results, however, were hit by the seasonal effects of vessel transits and dry docks, which led to lower overall vessel utilization and which were significant enough to outweigh the exceedingly strong sequential increase in multi-client sales, which were up 83%. ", "The strength in the seismic market, particularly in marine, led us to review our long-term plans for the fleet and this led to our acquisition of Eastern Echo during the quarter. The six high-performance vessels on order are for high capacity and are ideally suited to the exploration and development markets of the future. Our plans are to equip all six vessels with Q systems as the boats become available in 2009 and beyond. ", "In another acquisition, we acquired an additional 5.5% in Framo Engineering, taking our holding to a majority of 52.75%. A Norwegian based company, Framo provides multiphase booster pumps, flow metering equipment and swivel stack systems and is an important contributor to sub-sea engineering projects. ", "Shorter term growth presents a more complex picture than the immediate past. Natural gas drilling in North America is not expected to vary greatly in the absence of any severe winter weather in the remaining two months. High utilization of the existing off-shore rig fleet worldwide and limited new builds entering the market during the year will not only limit growth but will also make activity vulnerable to rig operating efficiency. ", "However, growth in land activity outside North America will remain strong, while seismic exploration services worldwide will remain in high demand, both on land and off-shore, as the industry gears up for the expanding exploration cycle. ", "Within this context, technology that assists our customers in mitigating risk in exploration and development projects, increasing our recovery factors, and improving operational efficiency will remain at a premium. ", "In the longer term, however, current levels of drilling are increasingly insufficient to meaningfully slow decline rates, improve reservoir recovery, or add sufficient new production capacity. The explosion in exploration licenses awarded in the last three years, the continual expansion of the number of new offshore rigs being ordered for delivery through and beyond the end of the decade, and the industry-wide, as well as our own plans to increase both CapEx and research and development spend are clear indicators of future growth. ", "It is our view that only a global economic recession that lowers demand can flatten this trend. ", "In line with this positive outlook, I am pleased to announce that the Board of Directors has increased the quarterly dividend for the fourth consecutive year and I will now hand the call back to Malcolm. ", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Andrew. Rod, we will now open the call for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Andrew, let\u2019s start with seismic here and on the one hand, the rhetoric and the message with respect to seismic in terms of visibility of revenue growth and customer demand being exceeding buoyant, is encouraging. ", "On the other hand, one would have expected that backlog would have been stronger quarter on quarter and I\u2019m just curious as to what\u2019s going on on that front. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Why is your assumption that backlog is weaker, Bill?", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Well, it was flat, wasn\u2019t it?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Marine. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Yes. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Was down. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "No, no, but overall backlog of $1.2 billion -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry -- no, well -- it\u2019s about the same as it was last year and it depends what your bidding tactic is. If you look at the number if inquiries to bid, there is no decline. In fact, there\u2019s an increase. Are you following me, Bill? In other words, some people decide to bid first and some people decide to bid later. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "That I understand. Maybe asking the question differently -- what percentage of your fleet is basically contracted into 2008?", "Andrew F. Gould", "At this point, the available vessel months is probably about -- still available -- or booked vessel months is about 60%, available is about 40. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Okay, switching gears to North America, was the preponderance of the weakness quarter on quarter with regard to margins attributable to pressure pumping pricing?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Okay, and then going forward, if one assumes that -- and no doubt a difficult question to answer but I am going to try it anyway in terms of asking it -- assuming flattish drilling conditions in North America, relative to Q4 margins, what is a reasonable expectation for the evolution of margins as they unfold in 2008?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that\u2019s a very difficult question to answer because we now probably have a reasonable outlook on what our portfolio is. We are flat out at lower prices and therefore it\u2019s a question of how much operational efficiency and reasonable cost savings you can generated. ", "But I don\u2019t -- all I will say is I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see another precipitous decline -- I\u2019ll probably regret this -- I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see another precipitous decline from now on. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Okay, and so with regard to the evolution of your cost cutting and right-sizing of the business, is that pretty much behind you?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Okay. Thank you very much, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan ", "Thanks and good morning. Andrew, for the Eastern hemisphere, margins were down. I understand mobilization issues and Mexico impacting Latin America. I guess the first question is two parts -- A, is there mobilization issues in Eastern hemisphere markets in Q4? And B, how should we think about mobilization impacting margins as we go into Q1 and \u201908?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that the bulk of the -- I don\u2019t think you should call it mobilization. It\u2019s start-up costs rather than mobilization, Michael. I think the bulk of it was in Mexico, though we did also start up some projects in Russia. But on the scale of things, they were tiny compared to Mexico. ", "Going forward, yes, we still have rigs to mobilize in Mexico in Q1. We haven\u2019t quite finished mobilizing those projects, so there will be some much less a degree I think of start-up costs in the first quarter. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay, so much more consistent with what we\u2019ve seen before Q4 in Mexico?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay, and then secondly, Andrew, if I think about the interpretations that are likely to come out of this conference call, perhaps you could maybe mitigate some of that concern and give us a few lines -- just a bottom line of what you think the key takeaways ought to be. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think the key takeaway is that as of today, worldwide 93% of the jack-ups are utilized, 97% of the semi-submersibles are utilized, and 100% of the drill ships are utilized. And the actual additions this year relative to the size of the total fleet are tiny, which means that offshore activity will be extremely vulnerable to rig moves, any dry docking -- anything that impacts the operational efficiency of the fleet and therefore, as I put in the comment, the scope to grow offshore in \u201908 is relatively limited. ", "The scope to grow onshore is still fairly unlimited but as we all know, mobilizing projects onshore takes a long time. You only have to look at the delays we\u2019ve seen in some of the Eastern Hemisphere countries in the last year to realize that the extent to which activity is going to increase is going to be good but it\u2019s not going to be great. ", "North America I really don\u2019t think I have to make any more comments about and then finally, if you look at the number of exploration licenses that have been let to us in the last three years all around the world, you have to believe that seismic is going to be very strong again. ", "So overall, I see 2008 as a transition year into a cycle which is going to be dominated offshore because I don\u2019t know whether you follow the numbers but the number of offshore rigs on order in the last quarter of this year increased by 14. So you have this huge wave of 160 offshore rigs for delivery from now through to 2011. ", "So this, Michael, for me is a transition year. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan ", "Okay. How about technology penetration in \u201908?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well actually, I think that the strongest element of our portfolio in 2008 which uses a little bit of everything of what we do is going to be IPM and then the classic technologies will still, I think, and everything to do with DDMWD, LWD continue to be very strong. And wireline will shift gradually towards more exploration and well services will wait for a recovery in Canada and the U.S. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan ", "Great. Thanks, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much. Just to follow-up on the last question, IPM becoming a driver in 2008, does that mean that there will be some margin pressure, given that IPM tends to have a lot of third-party revenues booked? Fairly good from a cash flow but as we model margins, they should maybe be a little bit lower? Is that the right -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yeah, actually we are going to do a study on that in the first quarter and decide how we disclose it to you. Because as you rightly point out, as IPM grows, it becomes a significant portion and if you remember once before we did actually tell you what revenues were at that level, so let us do a study and if we think it is really material information, we will make a disclosure. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that would be helpful, I think. Also, looking at your CapEx for the oilfield in \u201906, it was 50% up in \u201907. We grew by half that and in \u201908, you are guiding to about half that growth again. Does that reflect that your business is becoming more mature or is it a low point in \u201908? Is 13% really sustainable to justify that kind of growth -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think that there was an awful lot of catch-up in the previous we years and actually, seismic is increasing hugely and it will be even higher in \u201909. And the other segments, it\u2019s quite difficult to make a balance at this point in time but there could be a re-acceleration in \u201909. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that makes sense. Finally, on the offshore rigs coming in, I mean, you do see quite a number of jack-ups coming in -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yeah. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "-- a little delayed but still, any assumptions on market share loss within your caution on the effects of these rigs?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, a lot of these rigs don\u2019t have contracts yet. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Well, assume that they will go to work, given where rates are, so I don\u2019t think they will be sitting on the beach when you are getting $180,000, $70,00 for a jack-ups. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well they won\u2019t get $180,000 or $70,000 for jack-ups. A lot of our customers are waiting for them to be idle to tender. I don\u2019t see why you are talking about loss of market share though. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Well, Brazil for example in the direction drilling, although you [quoted that] for completion. I was wondering -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "That\u2019s one contract. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Well, thank you very much.

Yes, I suspect it will.", "Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Okay, and then the last question before I turn it back is coming back to the TGS-NOPEC joint venture in the Gulf of Mexico, you guys are contributing the vessels, the Q technology. What is TGS bringing to the table? I\u2019m a little bit unclear on that. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, TGS is bringing to the table the fact they had a great deal of pre-commitment from customers for this survey and the fact that they have a much larger sales force than we do. ", "And as I said, it\u2019s opportunistic, it makes sense to do it. You shouldn\u2019t read anymore into it than that. ", "Robert MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The last question we\u2019ll have time for comes from the line of Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Thanks, and I\u2019ll try to be quick; Andrew, I was a little surprised at the extent of the implied start-up expenses on the two Mexican contracts. With IPM getting larger, is that something that we\u2019re going to need to factor in when we make our quarterly assessments?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that if it\u2019s in a new area, as the Mezosoico and Alianza contracts are because they are in south Mexico, not in the north. We mobilized 17 large drilling rigs, they are not small, in six months. You can assume there are going to be start-up costs. ", "So you know, when you see a large project, you should assume some degree of start-up costs, particularly if it\u2019s in an area where we are not already working. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Okay, and then second, the seismic quarterly earnings pattern, this is the first time in a while that 4Q was below 3Q. Is that likely to be the pattern going forward with marine becoming so important now relative to multi-client? Or is this -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "-- is quite difficult to tell because as I said earlier, what happened this year was a lot of the North Sea -- the North Sea boats which normally move in Q3 actually moved in Q4. So I can\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t be able -- I can\u2019t give you an honest answer on that now. ", "What we will do I think is give you better information going forward when we know about dry docks and transiting. But we were caught by surprise by these late moves this year. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Okay, and I guess one last thing, which you probably won\u2019t answer but on the contracts that you signed for stimulation in the U.S. \u201908 versus \u201907, is pricing down in the double digits?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes, the low double digits -- just scratching the double digit. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Thanks a lot. That\u2019s it for me. ", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Rod will now provide the closing comments. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay beginning today at 2:15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, continuing through Friday, the 15th of February at midnight.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations for Schlumberger Limited, Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir. ", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Gail. Welcome to today\u2019s first quarter 2008 results conference call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin, I would like to review the logistics and format of today\u2019s call. ", "Some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. ", "And now for the call participants and format; joining the call from New Delhi, India are both Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew\u2019s overview of the first quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter\u2019s financial results. ", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Simon. ", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter income from continuing operations was $1.06 per share, down $0.05 sequentially and $0.10 above the same quarter of last year. An additional $0.03 gain was reported in discontinued operations. ", "Oilfield services first quarter revenue grew 3% sequentially, reflecting growth in North America and Europe/CIS/Africa areas. The seasonal year end strength in artificial lift and completions equipment sales, as well as SIS software sales reverted to normal levels in Q1 while traditional service segments, such as wireline, drilling and measurement, and well services showed sequential growth. WesternGeco reported weak multi-client sales only partly offset by an improvement in marine activity. ", "Oilfield services generated $1.5 billion in pretax operating income, down $33 million from the fourth quarter of last year but margins declined by 140 basis points to 26.8%. ", "By area, oilfield services highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis. ", "North America pretax margin improved 21 basis points to 25.6%, with strong seasonal activity in Canada and Alaska, augmented by full recovery in the Gulf Coast with the return of deepwater rigs, more than offsetting land access operational restriction in the Rockies, winter weather in the U.S. north, and pricing deterioration for well stimulation related services in the U.S. central market. ", "Latin America pretax margin declined by 203 basis points to 20.1%. In Mexico, IPM project [Recount] continued to grow with more activity but increased levels of project start-up costs and a high proportion of third-party managed services impacted our margins negatively. Reduced activity and the less favorable revenue mix due to project delays in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Brazil geomarkets also reduced margins. ", "For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area, the pretax margin declined 163 basis points to 26.3%, as Russia exhibited the seasonal slowdown off-shore cycling and incurred the start-up costs for several new projects while operational delays in the North Sea hampered drilling and measurement activity. ", "Strong activity was reported in the West Africa, Caspian, and Continental Europe geomarkets. The area included the consolidation of FRAMO for the first time. ", "Middle East/Asia pretax margin declined by 10 basis points to 34.9%. While the year-end high level of artificial lift and completions equipment sales, particularly in the Arabian geomarket was not repeated, exploration driven improvements in the Australia, Thailand, Vietnam, East Mediterranean and Gulf geomarkets more than offset seasonal weather slowdown in the China, Japan, Korea geomarket. ", "WesternGeco pretax income was $196 million, was a sequential drop in margin by 502 basis points to 29.1%. The reduction in multi-client sales and margins following the record sale in the previous quarter more than offset the modest recovery in marine performance. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 19.1%, which was lower than last quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of tax examination in a number of countries. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year 2008. ", "The earnings for the quarter included $41 million dollar of expenses relating to stock-based compensation costs. Net debt of $2.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $564 million for a stock buy-back program and $833 million for CapEx, including multi-client. CapEx excluding $81 million of multi-client survey capitalized was $772 million for the quarter. ", "During the quarter, we bought back 7 million shares for $564 million at an average price of $81.16 per share. As we are approaching the completion of the $40 million share buy-back, the board of directors approved a new repurchase program for $8 billion to be completed before the end of 2011. ", "And now I will turn the conference over to Andrew. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Thank you, Simon and good morning, everybody. Seasonal factors, weather related events, as well as lower product and software sales following the exceptional levels in the fourth quarter had a general dampening effect on sequential revenue gains with a consequent effect on margin. ", "Oilfield services revenue growth was strongest in the Canada, U.S. Gulf Coast, South Russia, Australia, Papua, New Guinea, Western Southern Africa, and Alaska geomarkets. Sequential revenue also grew through consolidation of FRAMO into the Europe/CIS/Africa area. ", "Among the technologies, demand was strongest for wireline, drilling and measurements, well services, and well testing activities. ", "In terms of geography, North America recorded the strongest growth as activity increased in the Gulf of Mexico, with the return of deep water rigs together with stronger demand for wireline and drilling and measurements exploration related services. ", "Canada saw a robust winter drilling season with high demand for wireline services in a renewed exploration market, as well as for well services technologies. Alaska benefited from exploration related growth. ", "The combination of these factors, which largely outweighed seasonal and weather events, as well as lower product [inaudible], translated into stronger margins, although pricing weakness continued to be seen in U.S. Central for well stimulation related activities. ", "In Latin America, growth was strongest in the Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobago geomarkets from higher demand for drilling and measurements, wireline and well services, as well as from higher SIS product sales. However, this was more than offset by project transitions and delays in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and in Mexico and Central America. Lower artificial lift and SIS product sales also offset overall growth. ", "Against the slight decline in revenue, margins lowered more significantly as the integrated project management activity in Mexico continued its rapid ramp-up of new projects with an additional seven drilling rigs being deployed in the quarter, resulting in heavy initial start-up costs being incurred. The majority of these new projects are in areas where wells are much deeper and hotter and as a result, take longer to drill. ", "Growth in the Europe, CIS and Africa was driven by a variety of positive factors. These included higher artificial lift system sales and increased well services market penetration in South Russia, strong demand for well services technologies in Continental Europe, increased demand for drilling and measurement technologies in Western Southern Africa and the Caspian, and higher IPM and drilling and measurements activity in North Africa. Area sequential growth also benefited from the consolidation of FRAMO revenue. ", "These positive factors were however mitigated by operational delays in the North Sea, winter weather in East Russia, and lower SIS product sales. ", "Sequential revenue in Middle East and Asia area declined slightly as exploration driven growth for wireline and well testing services in the Australia, Papua New Guinea geomarket, together with strong demand for wireline, well testing, and well services in the Gulf, East Mediterranean and the Thailand/Vietnam geomarkets were offset by the impact of winter weather in the China/Japan/Korea and lower completions and artificial lift systems product sales also contributed to this performance. ", "At WesternGeco, first quarter results fell sequentially as multi-client revenues declined steeply from the record levels of the fourth quarter. The Gulf of Mexico lease sale late in the quarter, coupled with the increased cost of wide-azimuth data sets that are fast becoming the norm for new multi-client purchases, delayed new activity until customers absorbed the results of the March leasing round. ", "In contrast, however, Marine revenue increased as both vessel utilization and productivity improved following the vessel dry docks and seasonal transits for the prior quarter. Data processing recorded a sequential increase in revenue while land declined as a result of project completions in North America and lower demand in the Middle East. ", "Looking ahead in the short to medium term, we expect a number of scheduled dry dock expense and vessel transit in the second quarter as activity switches from winter to summer seasons, while the uneven pattern in multi-client activity is likely to persist throughout the year. ", "WesternGeco technology applications saw growth during the quarter with a confirmation of a further set of Q-Marine time lapse surveys in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea for StatoilHydro on the Norne and Heidrun fields. These surveys represent the fifth successive survey at Norne and the third at Heidrun. Both form part of the ongoing efforts to maximize recovery from both fields through the identification of unswept and partially swept areas. ", "Q technology has also been selected for deployment of Q-Seabed surveys on the Oseberg Sor and Gullfaks fields, where the technology\u2019s low frequency capability is considered to be of particular value. ", "And in the sub-salt environment of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, processing has begun of integrated Q-Marine gravity and magnetotelluric electromagnetic data sets that form part of the E-Octopus multi-client wide-azimuth acquisition program. ", "Other new technology applications include well services FUTUR active set-cement which provides long-term zonal information through self-healing properties upon contact with any hydrocarbon based formation fluid. In Canada, this unique technology was used in an active geological area where maintaining cement integrity has been problematic. And in Italy, its use began on a 50 well natural gas storage field to prevent leakage of storage gas where wells are subject to alternating injection and production, in line with storage gas use. ", "Another new well services technology unique to Schlumberger, ACTive coil tubing, was deployed in Western Canada and Malaysia. The ACTive family of services uses fiber-optic cable in a down hole sensor package to monitor progress from a range of coil tubing enabled operations in real time. ", "In addition to these technology deployments, we passed a significant milestone in recruiting and training during the quarter with the opening of the Siberian Training Center in the Russian Federation in March. This new center includes all the facilities needed to train and develop our Russian languages employees in artificial lift, directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, data services and information solutions, as well as integrated project management. The current training capacity is expected to double over the next year to reach 350 students. ", "In closing, I would like to reiterate some comments that I made at the Howard Weil conference in New Orleans earlier this month. In the absence of severe global recession leading to a steep drop in demand, the thin cushion of excess oil supply and the failure to stem decline rates in many countries, coupled with a higher-than-expected drawdown of U.S. natural gas storage, are all factors that lead us to conclude the growth will strengthen as the year progresses. We remain convinced that current investment levels are insufficient to both stem decline and to explore and develop new reserves. As a result, we anticipate that the current cycle of exploration and production spending will remain stronger for a longer period than we originally anticipated. ", "I am now going to hand the call back to Gail. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question will come from Michael LaMotte with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "I guess the first question has to do with the comment that you made on the fourth quarter conference call regarding \u201908 being a transition year, particularly listening to some of the Geco commentary for Q2 and second half, I\u2019m wondering if you wanted to perhaps revisit that within the context of is 2008 going to be a transition year or is it a first half transition?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that when I made the comment in December, Michael, I was thinking it was a transition year. I would say that what has happened in North America, coupled with as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed some fairly dramatic declines in oil production in a number of places around the world, leaves me to believe that absent this global recession it\u2019s more and more a year in which growth is going to strengthen significantly in the second half. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "We\u2019ve been -- I guess all eyes have been on Russia and Mexico here in the first quarter, second quarter timeframe. Anywhere else? I understand seismic activity in India is very robust right now. Anything in the Eastern Hemisphere that we should be keeping an eye on?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, India, we just tell our board of directors here because firstly, it\u2019s our 75th anniversary in India but secondly because as you say, there is a dramatic increase in the willingness of India to find out whether it has any chance of domestic energy security and therefore huge investment in seismic and hopefully following that exploration, drilling. And as you know, they have one or two very large development programs that are underway.", "So I think that perhaps for us, the really interesting thing in Indian seismic is the fact that we have a -- our second largest processing worldwide is in India and we work very closely with the Indian industry on how to interpret Q to the maximum advantage. But it\u2019s symptomatic of perhaps the willingness of developing countries to find out what chance they have in energy security. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Should we think about India as seismic for \u201908/09 and the exploration and drilling in 2010 perhaps?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think -- I don\u2019t know their rig -- I don\u2019t think their rig program is fixed yet but certainly I think that as soon as they can get rigs, they will start exploration drilling. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. Thank you, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from  Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "With regard to seismic, I am trying to reconcile on the one hand the very favorable demand outlook that not only hearing from you but from others, with the fact that backlog has evolved rather slowly. Over the past three to six months, we\u2019re down 20% quarter on quarter. Walk us through with respect to the intermediate outlook with respect to contracting your vessels and what we should expect with regard to backlog build as the year unfolds. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think that some of the significant drop in the backlog is due to the fact that we have some very long-term commitments that have not yet been renewed but I would say are currently in the state of being bid. So I would suspect that, just as I said to Michael now, that to look for a significant increase in the backlog, you are probably looking into the second half year. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Okay, got it.  ", "Andrew F. Gould", "But there is no lack of bids out there. There is no lack of tendering, believe me. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "That\u2019s what I figured. Secondly, I was struck by the fact that there was no mention of what\u2019s going on with respect to Saudi Arabia and your rumored new contract there. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, it\u2019s not a rumor. I mean, -- but what strikes you, Bill?", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Well, there was no mention of it, no detail, no information provided on it. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, you probably realize we don\u2019t make announcements of any individual contract wins that we have. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Well just more plainly, could you enlighten us as to the parameters of that engagement?", "Andrew F. Gould", "All right, so [Manipur] is -- have we started to mobilize equipment? Yes. Is it eventually big? Yes. When will it start producing incremental revenue? A little bit in Q2 and the rest of the year but really ramping up in \u201909, not \u201908. That\u2019s about what I would tell you, Bill. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "That\u2019s all I have. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Dan Pickering with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead. ", "Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt", "Andrew, for the last couple of quarters you\u2019ve talked about expectations around the revenue growth in your business. We did not hear that commentary at least this quarter as it relates to kind of where Wall Street is at. Can we assume that silence means that expectations are now in generally the right spot?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I am very comfortable with Wall Street\u2019s assumptions on the full year 2008, Dan. ", "Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt", "Fantastic. Second question, back to the seismic business, last year end of the year we sort of saw a fair -- Marine take a fairly significant down-tick with some dry dockings and utilization. It didn\u2019t feel like it bounced up much here in the Q1, Andrew, and now we are looking for some more dry docks in Q2. I guess where I\u2019m going with this is, is there a change in the profitability of the Marine business or is this just a fairly lengthy period of getting all the assets in the right place?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Actually, I would say two things, Dan. Firstly there is a considerable pricing difference between winter season and summer season and they -- there is more and more a shift that takes place every winter and summer, so the actual number of transits that we do is increasing. ", "I don\u2019t think that we feel that that is going to affect the overall profitability of Marine if you take it on an annual basis. But I\u2019ve been trying to convey the message that seismic is going to be lumpy and it\u2019s lumpy in both marine and multi-client. ", "Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering Holt", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from  Charles Minervino with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning. I just wanted to touch on Russia a little bit. I saw that oil production was down in 1Q and several companies here are obviously moving aggressively in Russia in the services market. Could you just talk a little bit about how you are positioned there right now and really how you are going to grow? Will it be predominantly organic growth or will it be -- will you be looking at M&A in Russia?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think our feeling is that M&A -- Russia is now over-priced. We\u2019ve made our big moves and therefore I suspect that going forward, it\u2019s going to be organic and a lot of it will be IPM. So I don\u2019t -- we will do some M&A but nothing like the scale of what we did in the past four or five years. ", "And if you look at our business, then the well services market, the fracking market is over-supplied. The big growth element these days are services around drilling. ", "Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs", "Okay and just another question with regard to the offshore business. Can you talk a little bit about how your margins are in the offshore business? And then as we go forward here with the new build rigs coming, what that can mean for margins I guess one, two, maybe three years down the road?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think our offshore margins are fine. I really -- there\u2019s no significant shift in our offshore margins and going forward, the quality of our revenue will improve and the extent to which our quality of revenue improves really depends on the number of new rigs that are on exploration and then the exploration success that they have. ", "We have huge margin variation between a successful exploration well and an unsuccessful exploration well. ", "Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to David Anderson with UBS. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson - UBS", "Thank you. You mentioned just a few minutes ago the growth was going to significantly increase in the second half of the year. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit further. Was that just primarily centered around North America or were there some other regions? Because it seems to me that the offshore, the impact of the offshore new builds is more of a 2009 event, so I was just wondering if you can expand on that a bit. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Firstly, you are quite right to point out that the most significant change, compared to what I said in December because the remarks I made a few minutes ago were a function of what I said in the December call. The biggest shift is North America and that\u2019s true for revenue as well. ", "And overseas, I think that firstly we are -- I am personally still astonished at the demand for IPM and I think that the, if you like, perhaps I had underestimated the extent to which land drilling might expand, but I would caution you that this is very much a second half event. ", "David Anderson - UBS", "Okay, and then just to touch back on Russia, we did notice there were some changes in the upstream tax regime and it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s had too much of an impact. Are you feeling a bit more optimistic that some more material changes could be coming about and is that kind of the next leg as to what\u2019s going to spur IPM work? And is this a 2009 event for you?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think the Russian Government will do what is necessary to release the money that is required to increase, to sustain or to increase production in function of their 2% a year objective and I agree with you that what they have announced so far is not sufficient. But I am pretty sure that they will get it right in the end. So it could -- you are quite right that largely it will be a 2009 event. ", "David Anderson - UBS", "Okay, and then just one last question on Mexico -- some of that proposed energy bill, there was some more performance based service contracts were mentioned in that, in the bill. I was just wondering, how does that impact your view on that market? And does, once again going back to IPM I guess, does that imply there is more IPM work on the horizon or is this really not going to go through?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Not so much that I think it will change their IPM programs but what it will allow us to do, which is going to be a very nice change, is it will allow us to be incentivized on the basis of the performance of technology, which is something very difficult to achieve under the current contractual regime. ", "David Anderson - UBS", "So you feel pretty optimistic that goes through?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think it\u2019s a -- well, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not speculating on the politics but if it does go through, it\u2019s probably a positive for everybody. ", "David Anderson - UBS", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Geoff Kieburtz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "The more positive outlook for North America in the prepared comments, there were several references to the continued weakening trend of North American stimulation prices. How do you see that playing out? Is your outlook for the North American market sufficiently more positive that you think that will turn around?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think that we\u2019ve seen the bottom, or we are seeing the bottom right now. Now obviously contractually, most of what we are going to do in 2008 is tied up. There is obviously some capacity that is not tied up and depending on the size of the rig count increase, there might be a little bit of pricing levers towards the end of the year. But that\u2019s not clear yet. ", "What I can say fairly definitively is we see in stimulation services, pricing is bottoming. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Do you see pricing leverage in any other product lines in the -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think that drilling and measurements, anything to do with directional drilling in the North American, as in most other markets, still has some pricing leverage. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "And shifting to Latin America, could you maybe give us a little bit more historical context? I mean, we heard in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re hearing again in the first quarter about start-up costs on IPM projects principally in Mexico. That\u2019s been a very big business for you for some time. What\u2019s going on? Are the projects shifting to different locations or what kind of is going on?", "Andrew F. Gould", "So the answer is both. In other words, the projects are shifting to different locations so the two large projects we\u2019ve been mobilizing in the last six months are both in the Villahermosa Basin, which is deep and hot and at the same time, we\u2019ve been mobilizing again rigs to Chicontepec and we will in the second quarter be mobilizing Burgos 7. So Burgos 7 and Chicontepec, if you like, is the traditional IPM activity in Mexico. The stuff in the south is the new IPM activity in Mexico. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Both volume and mix then, basically. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes, both volume and mix but the whole -- the whole number of contracts, our IPM tenders has changed scale in the last year. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "And your comment about IPM more broadly, because you\u2019ve mentioned it in the context of other regions as well, should we hear or interpret those comments to mean that we are going to see more of this, where project start-up, margin effects become more common?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll have many projects that start on the scale of what we are starting in Mexico, so to that extent, no. There will I think be a project start-up effect in every quarter but probably at a decreasing level, at least for the balance of this year, a decreasing level per quarter, Geoff. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you, Andrew. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to James Crandell with Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning. To follow-up on that question, Andrew, on the IPM business, do you see the IPM business getting more price competitive today and if it is going to spread, will more and more NOCs be looking for increased price concessions and IPM work in the future, if that\u2019s competitively bid?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, firstly we don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- I know what you\u2019ve been hearing, Jim. We don\u2019t see IPM as being any more price competitive today than it was two or three years ago. What is true is that every time we go to a new basin, there is a learning curve and going up that learning curve takes a little time but once you are up it, you actually have a huge competitive advantage and we just celebrated drilling our 1,000th well in the Burgos field. When you\u2019ve drilled a thousand wells, you probably have a pretty good knowledge of how to do it and actually the levels of return we make out of those projects have improved over time, whatever\u2019s happened to the pricing. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and I have a question also about E&P spending, Andrew. Our work suggests that we\u2019ve added upwards of $10 billion now to the E&P spend since our survey was published in December and maybe 40% of that is in North America. Do you think as you look at the U.S. today that we could be looking at additions of somewhere in the range of 200 to 250 rigs over the course of this year? And internationally, I guess would you think that the recovery is stronger that what you thought previously, given budget announcements and the higher oil prices and that you could with some confidence now look at least a 20% revenue growth in your international oil services business in \u201908?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I feel quite confident that the international spending is going to increase and we weren\u2019t that far from the number you mentioned, so it\u2019s not in any way impossible. ", "I think in terms of North America, I don\u2019t really have a good enough read to know whether it\u2019s 100 or 200 rigs yet. I don\u2019t know. I think it will depend a little bit on the economy and a little bit on the capacity of the industry to follow, but it\u2019s not impossible. ", "I just don\u2019t -- ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "-- you said 200 and 250, I don\u2019t feel confident yet of that level. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, but you will pretty soon -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "That was just U.S. That was just U.S., Jim, right?", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Just U.S., Andrew, right. And one other quick question; Andrew, how many in total seismic vessels between Eastern Echo and what you are building, you were intending to build any way, do you have on -- either on order or in the plan? And can you give me a rough idea on the timing of delivery of those?", "Andrew F. Gould", "We have eight vessels on order. We will get one more this year which is not an Eastern Echo one, it\u2019s a Blue Arrow, which will come in the third quarter. We will start taking delivery of Eastern Echo in Q1 next year and substantially most of Eastern Echo should be in the course of \u201909. ", "James Crandell - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brad Handler with Wachovia. Please go ahead.", "Brad Handler - Wachovia", "Thanks. Could you please speak some more to the buying behavior related to wide and rich azimuth multi-client? I guess I\u2019m just a little confused about whether or not there is some sacrifice of sales that gets made if you sell things after a specific oil company has the lease sale as opposed to before where you might have had more bidders. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think that your point is a valid point but actually what it does is to add an additional risk, which is that you shot your seismic in the right place for that particular client to buy it as he\u2019s buying it, when he knows what lease he has. Whereas before, he was buying much cheaper seismic but on the basis that he would be -- he might be bidding any number of blocks. ", "So it does add an additional risk but I am not uncomfortable with the coverage that we have in view of the last lease sale. ", "I think there are three things in the multi-client for 2008. The first is there was some buying in Q4 in anticipation of the lease sale. The second is the lease sale was extremely late in the quarter and has all the implications of wide-azimuth data. And the third is that we have three phases of E-Octopus to deliver during the second half of the year, which will add a considerable volume of new product to our library. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia", "Okay. If I could stay with this just for a couple of other follow-ups, I just want to make sure I get it; so assuming the risk variable, and I appreciate you telling us about that, assuming that that works itself out favorably, do you have any reason to think that your wide azimuth prospects have lessened relative to what you may have thought about a year or two ago when you first sort of ventured into the Gulf of Mexico region?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Wide-azimuth, no, I don\u2019t. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia", "Okay, so the pricing dynamic is -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "There may be timing differences but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s lessened overall volume prospects. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Is it fair for us to think about 2Q as having a pretty healthy snap back in multi-client based on the fact that we\u2019ve gotten through this lease sale?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I would think more in terms of the second half year. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia", "Okay. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Because as I said, we have new product to deliver and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll deliver a lot of it in Q2 and there is another lease sale coming up in October. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia", "Okay. And then is pre-funding levels changing at all as it relates to wide-azimuth?", "Andrew F. Gould", "They are not as healthy as they were I think perhaps two or three years ago when we were pre-funding normal reprocessing projects and normal 3D, but they are still pretty healthy. ", "Brad Handler - Wachovia", "Again, I guess getting back to that risk point you made. Okay, one sort of side -- I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s important at all but there was a press release by electromagnetic geoservices about a patent case in The Netherlands. Again, forgive me if this is completely trivial but is that at all relevant to your business? Does it at all hamper any of your efforts for the -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, I mean, to be -- the press release I felt was somewhat disingenuous. The Dutch Court did not rule; it deferred the decision to the European Patent Office, so no patents were validated or invalidated. ", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Ken Sill with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Thank you. Andrew, I wanted to ask a question, something that\u2019s kind of popped up in the comments as an area of weakness was Schlumberger Information Systems. It was weak in North America and a lot of other regions. I wondered if you could give us a little bit of insight into is this another business that is going to be seasonal or was this just a year-on-year rollover?", "Andrew F. Gould", "It\u2019s traditionally -- SIS information systems is a bit like seismic in as much as customers use up their budgets at year-end to purchase software and in a year when our growth rate is a bit slower than it was in the past two years, that shows up in Q1 as opposed to Q4. So we had very, very high sales in Q4 and lower sales in Q1 but it\u2019s not new. It\u2019s just showing up more. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, I knew it had been there and my next question was kind of is this something that -- are the margins in information systems solution very different from what you are getting in your kind of core oil field service businesses?", "Andrew F. Gould", "They are very good. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "They are very -- so this would be a high margin business -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "This is a software business, yes. This is a software business. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, so and then in terms of the seasonal recovery, kind of expect something gradual and building to a year-end crescendo again?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "So just -- and then to kind of close the gap here, so you are very happy with where Wall Street is for the year. Obviously we have the pattern wrong, pretty clear. What is your outlook now for 2009? I know it\u2019s awful early but you are going to have the deep water rigs on, North America will be growing fairly substantially. I mean, does tightening up North America help pricing power globally in the outlook for \u201909?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think it would need quite a lot of tightening to -- basically you are talking about pressure pumping. Segments where Schlumberger participates, you are talking about pressure pumping and I think that it would take quite a lot of tightening to really affect overseas markets. ", "And I was warned by Malcolm that somebody would ask me about \u201909, so my gut feeling and it\u2019s no more than a gut feeling, is that \u201909 will be better than \u201908 in terms of growth, overall growth. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "In overall growth?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I know that doesn\u2019t help you very much but really, it is awfully early. ", "Ken Sill - Credit Suisse", "Well, and you don\u2019t want to get too excited about things but I just wanted to get your feel for that early in the year. Okay, thank you, Andrew. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak. Please go ahead. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Thanks. Andrew, I wonder about profit margins; they came in a little bit below my expectations for oil field in a couple of markets, Latin America obviously I guess is a function of to some degree of Mexico and other issues. And then the Europe/CIS. Do you expect the -- I\u2019m wondering if margins have peaked for the cycle or are these kind of short-term factors and there is still margin upside, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere markets where you are so strong?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don\u2019t think you can make a judgment on the basis of Q1, so Latin America is very definitely a function of Mexico but also the project disruption that I pointed out in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador, and a little bit in the south where we had an activity stoppage. ", "And in Europe/Africa/CIS, I would say that there is no reason to suppose that has gone down permanently. It\u2019s largely seasonal plus the inclusion of FRAMO as a consolidated item for the first time. Before it was an equity pick-up. And FRAMO\u2019s margins, while very healthy, are not at the same level as OFS. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Okay, so there\u2019s a little bit of an apples-to-oranges comp there?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Okay, and then you talked about the tight global supplies and one of the issues that I have is that governments around the world seem to be with collective greed conspiring to slow things down. Is that a significant concern of yours, I mean, Russia being one place that\u2019s pretty obvious but other places as well -- for instance, Venezuela. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Alaska. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "The U.S., I suppose. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "You are quite correct. It is a concern, Kevin. Our governments think they can tax $100 oil with impunity and that\u2019s not the case. And it\u2019s not so much the amount of the tax; it\u2019s the fact that it produces a degree of uncertainty into our customers\u2019 investment decisions and therefore they have to presume a certain degree of risk, which makes them shy. So you are quite right to point out it is a concern. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "But to some degree in a way, it\u2019s baked into your thinking that high comfort level, that an \u201909 growth is going to be -- we\u2019ll say comfortably in excess of -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "\u201909 growth is more dependent on offshore, which as you know is very long-term and therefore, governments tend to behave more rationally, if you like. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Yeah, well, they have less leverage there. All right, thank you. That\u2019s it for me. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Benjamin Dell at Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein", "I know you\u2019ve had a lot of questions around the seismic business but maybe I could just ask one on 2009. We obviously have a big stream of capacity expansion which actually accelerates into 2009. How do you see that impacting margins in this business?", "Andrew F. Gould", "If there is an erosion in Marine margins, it\u2019s going to be towards the end of 2009. It\u2019s not going to be at the beginning. And in fact, capacity is so solidly absorbed for 2008 that any erosion in 2009 is going to be minor. I would worry more about 2010 if I were you. Because 2009 there is a clear demand today and you can match that demand to the capacity that\u2019s coming on. ", "Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein", "And when you look at the application of multi-azimuth seismic outside the Gulf of Mexico, obviously the Gulf\u2019s got pretty unique geology in terms of its salt [inaudible]. Which other basins do you see that being applied to? Because it appears that only really Angola has the potential for sub-salt [layers]. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "West Africa. I mean, Nigeria, some of the deep water in Nigeria. Some in Brazil. There\u2019s certainly applications in India, where I am now but it\u2019s actually more basalt than salt, which is a slightly different problem. There are applications in the northern parts of the North Sea; again it\u2019s largely -- it\u2019s basalt rather than salt, but you are quite right to point out that the two large markets are the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, but I wouldn\u2019t rule out Nigeria. I wouldn\u2019t say just Angola. ", "Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay and just lastly, you mentioned your seismic vessel additions. Did you cancel the options on the fifth and sixth Eastern Echo boats or not?", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we didn\u2019t.", "Benjamin Dell - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Pierre Turner with [inaudible]. Please go ahead. ", "Pierre Turner ", "That was close but good morning, gentlemen. Most of the questions have been answered, maybe a little bit more on Marine and the pre-funding. Andrew, would you care to speculate a little bit -- you did mention that it was I think down sequentially from where it had been, but could you tell us where you might expect pre-funding to end up on some of your large multi-client Gulf of Mexico?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Actually, probably I should have been more explicit, yeah. One of the things that is happening is we were pre-funding reprocessing projects where the actual investment on our part was much smaller than in multi-client acquisition, and therefore we had very, very high pre-funding ratios and they were very often way over 100%. So our pre-funding ratios in function of the acquisition programs have dropped below 100%, but I would still describe them as healthy and we tend not to commit unless we feel we have an adequate pre-funding ratio. ", "Pierre Turner ", "So on an -- I think that is helpful color because your point is that on an absolute basis, and is that what your commentary is about the library sales, that basically the budgets are such people are spending it on the pre-funding of enhanced azimuth information. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "But you know, there is still an after-sales market beyond the pre-funding in wide azimuth. It\u2019s just that -- that\u2019s why I mentioned this additional risk factor that your wide azimuth is in the right place. ", "Pierre Turner ", "Okay. The other one with just a little bit more color again had to do with IPM start-ups, and I appreciate that you have addressed a number of issues related to that, but to the extent we could get a feel for how much are we through the start-up costs and maybe some -- how many rigs we have on IPM and where do you expect that to be at the end of \u201908? Is it in terms of increases and -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well I mean, in the last year we started about 35 rigs. We are going to start another six but they are the Burgos ones in Q2 and Burgos ones, I really don\u2019t think there will be a huge start-up issue in that, so that leaves another 10 around the world for the balance of the year. ", "So I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the start-up cost element in the quarterly results will decrease from now going forward. ", "Pierre Turner ", "Okay. That\u2019s the color I was looking for. The rest has been answered. Thank you, gentlemen. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go to Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Just going to hit you out right with this one -- so when do you think the peak is, Andrew, 2013 or 2015?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, you know, you are going to have to make so many assumptions on the economy and all the rest of it that that\u2019s a very, very difficult one to call. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Let\u2019s just say predicated on the decline rates you see in Mexico and Canterell and some issues in Russia -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don\u2019t think this cycle is going to peak without a drop in demand, and a drop in demand can come two ways; it can come violently through a global economic recession or it can come gradually, which is through the gradual substitution of hydrocarbons with other sources of energy. And if that\u2019s the case, you know, it\u2019s a long -- any transition to meaningful volumes of another source of energy is a decade or longer. So take your pick which way it is going to happen. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "In that period from 1970 to 1980, according to stats I pulled together, E&P spending grew like 25% a year on average over that decade. Do you think there\u2019s a possibility that the next five years or so could replicate that 25% a year on E&P spend?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well you see, I think this cycle is very different from 1970 to 1980, and it\u2019s different in two senses. One is that in 1970 to 1980, I think that there was some physical shortage but really it was a political shortage. The other thing is that the developments that took place in the 1970s, which were basically added six or seven million barrels or even more a day were Alaska, Mexico, and the North Sea, and those discoveries were made in the 1960s. So there was no exploration to be done. ", "So this time I think it is much more difficult, if you like, to see where the development is going to come that is going to produce significant volumes except for the Middle East, Central Asia, and Russia. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "And how do we -- how do you think we should consider your growth rate opportunity in Brazil, you know, follow-on with the Tupi and now some of this chatter around the Carioca field. Where is your opportunity set down there? Maybe you could discuss it by product line importance. And then how should we think about the growth rates in Brazil in general?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that I would characterize 2008 as good and 2009 as excellent basically because the large addition of [Floaters] is going to be in 2009, not 2008. And contractually we are very -- we are mostly very pleased with what we have. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "That\u2019s for Brazil, right?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes, Brazil. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "And how about in terms of product line importance for you in Brazil? How would you rank it?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, it\u2019s very important for wireline. It\u2019s extremely important for testing. It\u2019s important for D&M but not as important as it should be, and well services and the others have a presence but -- we have a very satisfactory position. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "And if I may just close out here, is there any -- is the opportunity set on land in Brazil, are there any good possibilities there or is it mostly just going to be the offshore as we\u2019ve heard?", "Andrew F. Gould", "There is some opportunity on land but it is not going to be anything on the same scale as offshore. ", "Operator", "And our final question today comes from Robin Shoemaker with Bear Stearns. Please go ahead.", "Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns", "In your Q&A, you have the statement that you\u2019re 33% third-party content in IPM and that that will be increasing to mid-40s. Is this increasing content of third-party services in any way related to the delays you are experiencing? And what should we think about in terms of overall integrated project margins as third-party content increases from 33% to the mid-40s. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of delay; it\u2019s more a question of different work scopes. Simon, would you like to comment on the margin evolution?", "Simon Ayat", "You are raising a very valid question here about the third-party element of our services provided under the IPM contracts. These don\u2019t attract the same type of margin regionally on our services. Our services are at least the same type of margin we generate or even better. Now, the third party, we do cover our costs associated with them but they are lower margin. ", "Now, what you\u2019ve seen, the 33% versus the 40% through the year, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect the overall margins of the projects because the efficiency on the rest of the activity would be more than compensating the small deterioration that a 7% decrease will cause. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns", "Okay. And then the only other question I had was Andrew, you commented on a little bit on the acquisitions market, M&A market in Russia as somewhat over-priced. Can you comment overall on Schlumberger's acquisition strategy? We see recently a lot of M&A activity and also private equity getting involved in purchasing oilfield service assets in companies. Can we read into this expanded share buy-back program that there is perhaps a little less attractive acquisition opportunities for Schlumberger? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "No. In the calculation of the amount of cash available for buy-back, we have assumed the same level of acquisitions as we\u2019ve generally been practicing over the last three or four years. Now, I don\u2019t think you will see us as I\u2019ve said on many occasions make a major acquisition, particularly at these valuations. However, increasingly we will make niche acquisitions largely for parts of our service line that we don\u2019t have or for technology opportunities that we identify. ", "But it doesn\u2019t -- the program in itself does not signal and reduction in our acquisition strategy. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thank you.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Gail will now provide the closing comments.

Prior to Andrew\u2019s overview of the second quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter\u2019s financial results. ", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Second quarter income from continuing operations was $1.16 per share up $0.10 sequentially and $0.14 above the same quarter of last year.  Oilfield services second quarter revenue grew 8% sequentially reflecting strong growth in all geographical areas despite the impact of Canada\u2019s spring break-up on North America.  Outside of North America oilfield services revenue grew 11% sequentially.  Oil technologies grew sequentially with IPM completions, this year\u2019s testing SIS, and drilling and measurement are showing double-digit growth rates while WesternGeco was essentially fast for the first quarter.  Oilfield services generated $1.7 billion in pre-tax operating income up $202 million from the first quarter with margins improving by 129 basis points to 28.1%.  Outside North America operation margins improved by 218 basis points to 29.4%.", "By area, oilfield services highlights were as follows with comments on a sequential basis.  North America pre-tax margin declined 167 basis points to 23.9% with improvements in the US land GecoMarkets which witnessed strong well services and one-line activities and in the US Gulf Coast which saw increased demand of high margin blending in measurements technologies were more than offset by the impact of the spring break-up in Canada.  Without the impact of Canada, North America margins improved sequentially despite the continued increase in cost of operations.  Latin America pre-tax margin rebounded by 296 basis points to 23% primarily due to increased demand for high margin technologies offshore in Mexico/Central America together with a more favorable activity mix in Brazil.  In addition lower IPM project start-up costs on land in Mexico/Central America also contributed to this improvement.", "For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area the pre-tax margin improved 181 basis points to 28.2%.  The North Sea experienced a record quarter with high margin drilling and measurement technology is gaining from higher drilling activity and one-line benefitting from the drilling of high-pressure high-temperature wells.  In addition the rebound of East Russia following the slowdown in the winter and the more favorable activity mix in West and South Africa GeoMarkets also contributed to this improvement.  This performance was partially offset by operational delays in the Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea GeoMarkets.", "Middle East Asia pre-tax margin increased by 148 basis points to 36.3% most notably due to an increased demand for high margin wire line, drilling and measurement, and well services technologies in the China/Japan/Korea, Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, and Gulf GeoMarkets.  This performance was also driven by a more favorable activity mix for exploration driven services in Australia and Thailand/Vietnam.  However, these increases were partially offset by a slowdown in India and Qatar.", "WesternGeco pre-tax income was $196 million and a margin of 29.2% well in line with the previous quarter as improvements in land and data processing performance were partially offset by the impact of the market/client sales mix in North America.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 20.9% which was higher than last quarter due to the geographic mix of earnings in WesternGeco as well as the positive impact in the prior quarter of the favorable resolution of tax examination in a number of countries.  The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year.  The earnings for the quarter included $41 million of expenses relating to stock-based compensation and costs.  Net debt was $2 billion at the end of the quarter.  Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $555 million for a stock buy-back program, $1 billion of cap ex including $107 million of multi client surveys kept alive.

Gould ", "The strong sequential growth seen in the second quarter throughout the Eastern Hemisphere led to the improved performance in all areas except North America where the effects of strong growth in the lower 48 states and the US Gulf of Mexico was more than offset by a prolonged spring break-up in Canada.  Growth was helped by increased drilling efficiency in the North Sea, improved performance and lower mobilization costs on IPM projects in Mexico and Russia, and a favorable expiration mix particularly in the North Sea, Eastern Siberia, and Southeast Asia.  The quarter also saw increased demand for well placement technologies and rigless work as operators strived to increase production from existing fields.", "Looking at the areas in more detail, the Lewis Land GeoMarkets in North America reported strong revenue increases driven by a robust demand for well services and wire line technologies in addition to a rebound in activity following the end of the seasonal winter weather restrictions.  Offshore the US Gulf Coast also registered strong growth through demand for drilling and measurement services and a surge in completion product sales.  These increases were largely offset by the seasonal slowdown in Canada.", "In Latin America sequential revenue growth was strong across the area led by Mexico/Central America GeoMarket due to the ramp up of IPM projects as well as the higher offshore activity.  Peru/Colombia/Ecuador saw significant improvements due to the higher demand for wire line and drilling and measurements technologies together with increased gain share of an IPM activity in Colombia while the Venezuela/Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets benefitted from strong demand for well services and wire line technologies.  In the Brazil GeoMarket growth was driven by higher expiration activity and increased SIS product sales.  The Argentina/Bolivia/Chile GeoMarket improved on strong demand for well services and wire line technologies; however, growth was partially offset by operational delays in Argentina.", "Sequential revenue growth in Europe/CIS/Africa was driven primarily by demand for all technologies across the North Seas GeoMarket particularly by drilling and measurement and high-pressure high-temperature wire line services.  Strong activity for all technologies in West and Southern Africa together with increased demand for expiration related activities in East Russia also contributed to growth.", "In the Middle East Asia area sequential revenue growth was led by the Arabian GeoMarket with high demand for well services and testing services technologies together with increased completion system product sales.  The China/Japan/Korea GeoMarket experienced a robust rebound in activity following the winter slowdown in the first quarter while Australia/Papua New Guinea grew on increased offshore expiration activity that resulted in strong demand for wire line and drilling and measurement services.  Growth was also recorded from expiration related wire line services in the Thailand/Vietnam and from wire line and well services technologies and SIS product sales in the Gulf GeoMarket.  Well service technologies and artificial lift products were particularly strong in Indonesia.  Activity declines in India and Qatar partially offset these positive factors.", "Oilfield services bidding activity during the quarter was strong particularly for drilling and measurements, wire line and testing services.  This led to a number of significant contract awards particularly in the area of drilling services where advances in rotary-steerable systems and well placement technologies coupled with increased reliability are critical to operators in today\u2019s environment of very high-spread costs for offshore rigs.", "Our WesternGeco sequential revenue is essentially flat but increases in multi client sales and data processing were offset by the seasonal drop in marine activity.  Significant increases were recorded in the backlog for land operations while marine contract bidding activity remained robust.  Newly awarded activity included a contract in Indonesia for the proprietary WesternGeco coil shooting as a [azimuthal] acquisition technique that uses a single Q-marine vessel to acquire [azimuthal] data thus significantly increasing operational efficiency.  Also a contract in Kuwait for the largest Q-land acquisition and processing contract ever won that is expected to last for two years.", "Turning now to other events, we made a number of acquisitions during the quarter that increased our capabilities or added specific technologies to our portfolio.  In Canada shareholders of Saxon Drilling voted to accept the Schlumberger offer made jointly with First Reserve Capital to acquire the company.  Schlumberger has enjoyed a long association with Saxon which has included operating joint ventures in Mexico and Colombia that deliver drilling services to support integrative project management activities.", "Also in Canada we acquired the business of Extreme Engineering Limited a leading supplier of unmanned MWD systems to land markets in the US and Canada.  This acquisition will help facilitate the rapid uptake of rotary-steerable systems technology in these highly cost-sensitive drilling environments.", "Other technology acquisitions included integrated expiration systems, a Germany-based technology leader in petroleum systems modeling, Staag Imaging a Houston-based provider of leading edge imaging technologies for seismic data processing.  Both these acquisitions add further strength to our seismic offering in an expiration market where we expect to see more and more demand for technology integration.", "At the beginning of the year we predicted a more complex growth pattern for 2008.  Notably we were uncertain of the evolution of North American natural gas activity and the extent to which delays in the completion of new built offshore rigs would affect growth.  We anticipated solid increases in the Eastern Hemisphere land rig count.  But at half year the uncertainty around the direction of natural gas drilling in North America has been removed and extremely high commodity prices have led operators to increase their budgets overseas.  We anticipate that approximately 35 new offshore rigs will enter the fleet in the remaining half of the year.  The overseas land rig count has evolved much as we predicted.  It appears that customers are responding vigorously to the current commodity price levels.  Inflationary pressures particularly for certain commodity supplies and some categories of personnel are increasing worldwide but particularly in North America where the rapid ramp up in activity is exaggerating the trend.  Improved pricing will be key to further investment in some markets.  In the longer term we remain convinced that absence in deep worldwide recession leading to a steep in demand, higher levels of investment will have to be sustained to bring some equilibrium to the market.  We therefore reiterate our stronger for longer view of the current cycle of expiration and production spending.  It is significant that during the quarter an additional 28 new offshore rigs were reported ordered from shipyards with delivery dates out to 2012 increasing the total on order to more than 180.", "I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.", "Malcolm Theobald", "We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Our first question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Andrew, how much conviction do you have in North America beyond year end given the rapid increase in production and do you think you\u2019ll be able to book some net pricing gains across all your product lines before the end of the year?", "Andrew F.

And on land I actually think that Russia will be very strong again.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Cap ex at the beginning of the year you highlighted at that point in time was 13% and we felt at the time the conference call was made that it was low.  Now you\u2019re going up to 29% year-over-year which seems to say very confident tone for how you see your business.  Could you talk a little bit about exactly what product line, what regions that you have grown more confident on to have this type of a cap ex increase relative to the beginning of the year?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I would say the beginning of the year cap ex was very much orientated to how we saw the evolution of the offshore rig fleet.

I would imagine that other form of products like completion or rental tools or anything to do with the metal in the well work could be getting some pricing.  How do you see those segments of the market now?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I mean you have to remember that in most of our tools we\u2019re using specialty alloys.  We\u2019re not using - the steels are they type one uses in drill pipe or casing.  So the price increases in specialty alloys are horrible.  Look at chrome 25 and stuff like that, the price has doubled.  But there\u2019s not an availability issue.  So there is a cost issue but not an availability issue in the alloys that we use mostly.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "So you have the ability to raise prices to compensate for this?", "Andrew F.

But going forward, reconcile the tension for me between on the one hand increasing drilling and technological intensity and rising offshore content with an environment in which is still fairly competitive on these bigger projects and some of these projects are being won, not necessarily from you, with sort of seemingly start pricing and bids, and also cost inflation seems to be relatively be unabated.  So given all those elements, where do margins go from here internationally?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I think if people want to maintain or increase their international margins, they\u2019re going to have to pay attention to inflation particularly in any sort of project that requires a great deal of third party supplies.  In a technology sense of projects, big offshore drilling or stuff like that, I think that the operators spread cost of rigs is so huge compared to the marginal increase in pricing that we need that it\u2019s not a big issue.  Reliability is becoming more important every day.  So I don\u2019t think that people will win very large offshore drilling projects on price necessarily.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "So specifically, do you expect international margins to continue improving?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I said at the beginning of the year that it will be lumpy.  So in a quarter where we have really good exploration activity and really strong drilling activity like this quarter, there\u2019s no doubt that margins can increase.  In a quarter where you have seasonal weather in the North Sea or China shuts down for the winter, then you probably have margin decline.  So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a constant linear increase over quarters but on an annual basis provided the exploration holds up, I don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t still have some room to run.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co.", "The follow up here with regard to North American pressure pumping, I was wondering as to how successful you were in the second quarter and how successful you are on a leading edge basis with respect to getting fuel surcharges implemented and cost inflation as it relates to fuel addressed?", "Andrew F.

Gould ", "No, no.  As Simon said at the beginning of his thing, North American GeoMarket margins increased in every GeoMarket except Canada but the effect of the long break-up was such that that nullified the effect of the global North America level.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners.", "Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "Andrew, I just want to make sure I understand your commentary around the international operators.  You said a vigorous response.  That combined with kind of the 20+%, I think you had been talking about high teens international growth rates.  It does sound like internationally clearly has picked up within the last two-three-four months.", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I was surprised, as I think we all were, by the strength of the rebound coming out of the winter so part of that was just the normal huge pick up in drilling efficiencies in the North Sea, stuff like that, but part of it was a real effort to where people could increase activity particularly on land where as you know it\u2019s much easier to increase activity than offshore.  But we were surprised by the strength of the rebound.", "Dan Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "Could you generally comment, your joint venture partner in MI is now in the directional drilling business, Smith Klein WHQ.  How does that affect your thinking about the MI joint venture going forward and what are the mechanics associated with that JV?", "Andrew F.

There will be competitive situations which will be quite difficult to manage but they\u2019re not very common and I don\u2019t\u2019 see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t continue to enjoy a good material relationship with MI.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "First, Andrew I was struck by the comment in the press release concerning the continental resources with the shale job.  I was wondering, you\u2019ve talked in the past about the technological evolution within the North American pumping business and it feels like reading that comment here in press releases or seeing press releases from operators talking about an 11 or 12 stage frac, etc. that there\u2019s perhaps more of a technological revolution going on in that business.  Can you talk about the pace of sort of technology uptake and what that could mean for margins just beyond pure pricing?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "Actually Mike I think that like any new play, operators will not pay for technology until they understand what it can do for them and now we\u2019re getting to the stage in shale gas where a combination of horizontal wells and stage fracturing together with this capacity that we have to monitor fracs in real time.  And it\u2019s very different.  If you monitor it and then just give the result to the customer afterwards, it\u2019s what we call internally a \u201cso what service.\u201d  \u201cYou told me what you did but you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d  If you do it in real time, it allows you to start to look at modifying the engineering of the frac as you\u2019re performing it which is really quite important.  So I think there\u2019s no common, not just Schlumberger by the way but the leading players in pressure pumping are now getting to the stage where there is some differentiation in what they can do.  And to a certain extent in a tight market that will reflect well in pricing.  In a very slow market it will allow them to maintain pricing.  But there\u2019s absolutely no doubt that the technology of contact, reservoir contact or contact with well bore is improving fairly dramatically at the moment.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "How would you characterize the uptake today versus what you might have thought 12 months ago?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "It suddenly accelerated.  I mean, 12 months ago we were experimenting with a lot of this stuff but it\u2019s now I think accelerating.  I think our issue is going to be providing it.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Second question, a lot of discussion on mix internationally, obviously a shift towards exploration helpful.  Are you seeing a discernible difference in the oil/natural gas mix on the exploration side given the tightness in the global gas market?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "Regionally yes.  In other words there is a lot of gas exploration in the Middle East for example.  Globally I would say it\u2019s still reasonably balanced between oil and gas.  What we are seeing more and more is that as you point out, the shortage of worldwide gas means that people are starting to look at unconventional sources of natural gas overseas which is something we thought would come much later.  You must have seen some of these deals in Australia where operators are going after coal-bed methane for example even to feed [LNG] sometimes.  So this is really very different.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Pretty massive.  And if I understand it correctly, the revenue process for rigs and process for rigs in international gas is even greater than the difference in North America.  ", "Andrew F. Gould ", "In the big [LNG] projects, that\u2019s undoubtedly the gas.

Gould ", "What I don\u2019t know is the honest answer today because it varies very much by country by country and area by area.  When we have campaigns of rig list work the margins, they\u2019re really very good because we normally get to control the execution which means we can be extremely efficient in the use of our resources.  So, we mentioned for example one or two contracts in the press release where we have 300 wells to do.  If we control the logistics on that the margins are very good.", "Charles Minervino \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then I guess in Latin America on margins typically, and it looks like you\u2019re getting closer to those peak levels you reached in 2007, is it safe to say that the startup costs in Mexico are pretty much behind the company at this point?  And, could you see margins potentially go higher in Latin America as those Mexico costs are completely wound out?", "", "Andrew F. Gould ", "Actually, I think the margins in Latin America were obviously, less the startup costs now, will be driven by the drilling performance.  We still have room to improve there so to the extent that we improve margins would improve.  But, I would also say that in Latin America there is the same shift as everywhere else towards more drilling, particularly of expiration wells and therefore the actual revenue mix is going to improve, not just IPM.

Could you comment on maybe how tight the directional drilling market is today?  And, more specifically, maybe how you see the North American market for directional services in the context I guess of higher directional rig count and then a rising rig count?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "Well, I think that if you watch the rate of growth in the horizontal rig count in the US competitive oil directional rig count, for all sorts of different reasons, be they geological reasons or be they infrastructure reasons, there\u2019s no doubt that directional drilling will go on increasing.  But, directional drilling in North America has to be provided at a cost that is effective otherwise it\u2019s not going to grow the way it should be.  So, our purchase of Extreme Engineering brings us a service where we can use NWD without manning it probably by monitoring it from a centralized drilling center.  So, we still think it has, in the land market both in the US and overseas, a long way to run.", "Alan Laws \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "When you look at that as a growth driver, how are you assessing that for Schlumberger?  Are you looking at is as more investing in maybe the lower end directional tools?  Or, is this an acquisition [inaudible].", "Andrew F. Gould ", "No, we could have built one ourselves but the fact is that Extreme Engineering is the company that was originally funded by Shell with technology from Shell and the decision of having it available through buying the company rather than developing our own became clearly obvious because of the rate of growth in the market.", "Alan Laws \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Last question will be on the bit side, you talked about wanting back in the bits business.  Can you talk a little bit about, no pun intended there, about strategic thinking behind this and what aspects of the product line that are most important to you?", "Andrew F.

I of course meant that Intec is a good competitor which is why I don\u2019t think they want it on press.", "David Anderson \u2013 UBS Securities", "I guess one other question I have for you there is you mentioned some time ago you had about $5 billion in IPM backlog, do you care to tells us out there what the number is now?", "Simon Ayat ", "It hasn\u2019t changed very much.", "David Anderson \u2013 UBS Securities", "Then you also mentioned on Russia you were much more confident on the activity increasing in Russia next year.  Is that because of IPM work coming through or do you see something else out there?", "Simon Ayat ", "It\u2019s Russia going forward will be a mixture of IPM and service contracts.", "David Anderson \u2013 UBS Securities", "So do you have confidence that the government is going to be lowering the taxes to a point that\u2019s going to spur more activity?", "Simon Ayat ", "Yes.", "David Anderson \u2013 UBS Securities", "I guess on a different related topic, on new build.  If you see the deep water new build, deep level water well runs around $100 million or so in total costs how much work  of that is potentially Schlumberger?  ", "Simon Ayat ", "Well potentially it\u2019s our four big product lines, so it\u2019s oil lines, well services, drilling and measurements and testing.  Please don\u2019t ask me for a number because a huge amount depends on whether that well is dry or if it has a find.  The actual scope of the revenue could change by a factor of two or three in function of whether or not the will finds anything or doesn\u2019t find anything.", "David Anderson \u2013 UBS Securities", "When you were talking about your cap ex before, I assume a big chunk of that is going to building out rotary steerable in anticipation of this new drilling and measurements.", "Simon Ayat ", "I think actually there is another in drilling and measurements and that is that with rig\u2019s spread cost at 1.2 double a day rate, so $1.2 million a day, people don\u2019t fish for stock tools very much, they just cement them in and sidetrack which means that the build out of cap ex has to be adjusted for that.", "David Anderson \u2013 UBS Securities", "My last question, just on rotary steerable, when you talked about your cap ex before, I assume a big chunk of your cap ex is going to building out rotary steerable based on the new build surge. Can you quantify it?  Can you quantify for us how much capacity is expected to increase year-over-year in rotary steerable?", "Simon Ayat ", "We\u2019d rather not.  I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019d rather no.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup.", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup", "Andrew, just on this \u2013 you\u2019ve mentioned several times on the call the number of offshore rigs being delivered in the next few years, how far along are we either on the 35 rigs delivered this year or the 180 in terms of allocating contracts for oil field services on those new rigs and kind of what\u2019s your strategy to maximize your presence on each of those new rigs?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "First I would like to point out that the 35 this year are very much loaded on Q4.  It may actually slip some in to 09.  So, if the equipment has to be bolted down, so cementing units or pumps or some of the testing spread, then the contracts will tend to get allocated, or at least the contracts for the equipment at the time of the build.  For oil line drilling and measurements and testing services, I would say that probably about half the contracted rigs have already awarded those contracts.  And, the reason they\u2019ve awarded them is very often because they\u2019re operator contracts particularly for exploration rigs that are going to move from country to country.  If they tend to be in very mature fields of operation like a North Sea or Gulf of Mexico, they may come under existing contract or they will get bid much closer to the time.", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup", "If we compare the business, how are you doing on the new builds compared to the existing fleet of the offshore rigs and your market share and various product lines?  Do you believe that on the new rigs your market share is same, or better, or worse?", "Simon Ayat ", "Andrew F. Gould ", "So far I think it\u2019s the same and we\u2019ll see where it goes going forward.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co.", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co.", "A couple of questions, one I guess just some clarification on Russia.  Andrew, could you quantify year-on-year revenue growth in Russia relative to end margins, relative to change, relative to the rest of the broader segment?  I guess I was expecting slower Russia.", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I think in the first half of the year it probably exceed the average of the rest of continental Europe, Europe Africa unit.  But, don\u2019t forget that we still have the effect of an acquisition in the first half of the year so it will probably slow a bit in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year.  But, through the effect of the acquisition not through the effect of lack of activity.", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co.", "We\u2019ve been hearing some pain from some of the smaller competitors in the frac business there.  Did you feel the same?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "The frac business has been tough particularly in the south for the first half of the year.  There was over capacity.  ", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co.", "Did that bring Russia\u2019s margins down for you overall?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "Not overall, no.", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co.", "Then just quickly I wanted to switch to North America.  You were reluctant to reach out on an 09 forecast that Kurt was fishing for.  Your customers all seem to be raising budgets, raising capital, you know pretty positive outlooks for 09 so is the reluctance just a function of the volatility in the market and the risk of gas prices?  Or, it\u2019s just too early to make a call?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "It\u2019s just too early.  I\u2019ve been reputed to making too early calls on North America so I thought this time I would wait a bit Kevin.  I don\u2019t know.  If you like, it\u2019s more a function of what Kurt said which is the very substantial increases in production we\u2019re seeing and then you know you have to take in to account the summer, the weather and all the rest of it and how much is the current oil prices affecting gas consumption.  The fact is that [inaudible] is going to the states, there are so many factors in it now that it is quite difficult to make a longer term call.  ", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co.", "In terms of allocating capital then you don\u2019t really have to make a decision yet?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "No, we\u2019ve got our cycle down to a level where we can make the allocation much later.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Robert MacKenzie \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey.", "Robert MacKenzie \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Andrew, I wanted to step back and address the stimulation of the Shell reservoirs more from a mechanical standpoint and try and get some idea.  One of the things I\u2019ve heard about that is being done recently is what someone called zipper frac to me whereby you offset the placement of the fracs in the adjacent well bore so that you can create an oblique stress field.  How much do you think that has potential to raise productivity something like the [barneck]?  Is that something that can help take the fraction from 3 million to 5 million a day along with other advancements.", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I have to tell you, I just don\u2019t know.  What I will tell you is that in producing Shell gas reservoirs fewer mechanics is fundamental.  In some ways it is more fundamental than petro physics.    You know, I am sure that there are lots of ideas going around about how you could alter stress fields in such a way as to release the gas but the fact is one of our top scientists spent some time looking at this recently and said one of the biggest issues with Shell gas is that nobody actually knows what the production mechanism is.  So, you may well be right, I don\u2019t know.  What I do know is that there still is a lot of work to be done on how these production mechanisms actually work.", "Robert MacKenzie \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "A follow up, I was wondering if you could share with us what you do know on how the shale oil production mechanism works say in the Bakken Shale.  That\u2019s still kind of a mystery to me.  I was wondering if you could just kind of shed some light on that.", "Simon Ayat ", "The shale oil in the Bakken?  I don\u2019t know.  I am aware of the different technologies that some of the majors are working on for the production of shale oil but I honestly haven\u2019t had a discussion of this in the context of the Bakken.  But, what I will do is get Malcolm to find out and give you a call, okay.", "Operator", "", "Our next question is from Pierre Conner \u2013 Capital One.", "Pierre Conner \u2013 Capital One", "Andrew, you\u2019ve addressed the capital changes on oil field services and I wondered if you could speak a little bit on reconciling your change in outlook on cap ex for WesternGeco both related to the construction on Eastern Echo vessels and also the change on the expected cap ex from multi client?  What\u2019s sort of driving that?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "So, there is no underlying change in our philosophy on the construction of the vessels.  We have one vessel that is delayed about four months which was suppose to come around about now but is not coming until the end of the year.  But, the Eastern Echo vessels seem to be pretty much on schedule and therefore there is no change in the level of cap ex.  Multi client, we have seen in the last quarter some improvement on pre-funding levels therefore \u2013 ", "Pierre Conner \u2013 Capital One", "Less cap ex.", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I think we\u2019ve increased slightly our budget but really it\u2019s marginal.  So, I would say that compared to what we showed you at the end of the first quarter, there\u2019s really no substantial change.", "Pierre Conner \u2013 Capital One", "Now, you mentioned that marine bidding was robust, can we read through there that there\u2019s still pricing power?  ", "Andrew F. Gould ", "In certain segments of the marine market there\u2019s still pricing power, yes.  ", "Pierre Conner \u2013 Capital One", "My follow up is again to try again sort of Kevin and Kurt on North America.  But, I\u2019m assuming that when you roll in North America that\u2019s inclusive, your conviction improvement is inclusive of Canada as well, is that correct?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "Yes.", "Pierre Conner \u2013 Capital One", "And maybe a different way to ask would be, do you know of a commodity price level?  Rather, we all have many variables in front of us, weather, summer, etc. but, what is this increase from your customer perspective due to the price increase, not just new developments?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "You mean our price increases?", "Pierre Conner \u2013 Capital One", "No, I\u2019m sorry, the commodity price increase?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "I think at current levels it\u2019s just fine.  I mean there is some guarantee of future activity to the extent to which our customers have hedged their forward production.  I certainly think that production drops in Canada will mean that it will be a very healthy Canada through the rest of this year and the first quarter of next year.  I\u2019m just not prepared to take a definitive position on the whole of North America land for next year yet.  I just don\u2019t feel comfortable doing it, sorry.", "Operator", "", "Our final question comes from Alan Laws \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", "Alan Laws \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "I just had a quick high level follow up question on growth.  When you look at what is the most important trends for Schlumberger over the next few years, if you looked at rise of exploration or expansion of the offshore recount, or the increasing well complexity or architecture, or then just straight out IPM, what would be the number one driver?", "Andrew F. Gould ", "Well I actually think there are probably two drivers.  I\u2019m thinking three to five years now, okay?  The first driver has to be the extent to which there is a real effort to renew the reserve base and therefore exploration which will largely be either offshore or in harsh environments.  But, as I mentioned in answer to I think it was Michael\u2019s question earlier, the current gas situation is such that a lot of gas exploration that was not planned two or three years ago is going to happen.  So, the first is exploration.  The second is, and I said this before and I\u2019ll say it again, is that the secret to stemming decline curves is number one you have to drill and number two you have to increase the amount of reservoir contact.  So, the service intensity around stemming the decline curve would have to increase fairly dramatically if people are serious about it.  And actually, I think that\u2019s a little bit what we saw in Q2 with the extremely high commodity price.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Malcolm Theobald. ", "Malcolm Theobald", "", "Before we begin I'd like to review the logistics and format of today's call. ", "Some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.", "And now for the call participants and format:  Joining the call from New York City are both Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the third quarter and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. ", "And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "", "Schlumberger third quarter income from continuing operations was $1.25 per share, up $0.09 sequentially and $0.16 above the same quarter last year. These results include a $0.04 impact from the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.", "Oilfield Services third quarter revenue grew 5% sequentially, reflecting strong growth in all geographical areas despite the impact of the hurricane season.", "WesternGeco revenue grew 33% sequentially, reflecting the seasonal strength in Marine operations that was boosted by strong multi client data sales.", "Oilfield Services generated $1.7 billion in pre-tax operating income, essentially flat as compared to the second quarter, with margins slipping by 155 basis points to 26.7%. ", "By area, Oilfield Services pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis.", "North America pre-tax margin decreased by 283 basis points to 21.1%, where the recovery and activity in Canada was more than offset by the hurricane effects on the U.S. Gulf of Mexico activity and the seasonal slowdown in Alaska.", "Latin America pre-tax margin declined 287 basis points to 20.1% as more favorable activity mix in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil were insufficient to offset increased third-party managed services in IPM projects in the Mexico/Central America geomarket. This effect was amplified by start up costs [inaudible] Burgos 7 project in Mexico.", "For ECA, the Europe/CIS/Africa area, the pre-tax margin improved 86 basis points to 29% as Russia experiences strong seasonal activity rebound offshore East Russia. This improvement, however, was partially offset by the impact of declines in the North Sea for both exploration and development operations.", "Finally, Middle East/Asia pre-tax margin moderated by 89 basis points to 35.5% as a more favorable activity mix in a number of geomarkets was insufficient to counter the effects of a less-favorable mix in Indonesia and a shift to lower margin workover-type activity in the Gulf.", "WesternGeco pre-tax income of $355 million, reflecting an increase in pre-tax margin by 10.6\u00a0percentage points to reach 39.8%, showed a strong growth over the second quarter and surpassed the performance of the same quarter last year. ", "Marine had a strong quarter, with higher activity at better pricing while multi client margins improved with higher sales.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 21.4%, which was slightly higher than last quarter due to the geographic mix of earnings in WesternGeco. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20s for the total year.", "Net debt was $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter, representing a sequential improvement of $300\u00a0million. Further, we ended the quarter with approximately $4 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.1 billion of committed debt facility agreements with commercial banks were available at the end of September. This compares to short-term debt of only $2.2 billion, reflecting the strength of the Schlumberger balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements.", "Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $545 million for the stock buyback program and $1 billion for Capex, including $75 million of multi client surveys capitalized. ", "During the quarter we bought back 5.96 million shares for $545 million at an average price of $91.45 per share. ", "Finally, the quarter earnings included $44 million of expenses relating to share-based compensation costs.", "And now I'll turn the conference over to Andrew. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "", "The strong continuation in sequential revenue growth in the third quarter was led by further strengthening of gas drilling activity on land in the U.S. and Canada, a very active summer drilling season in Russia, and continuing growth of IPM activity in Latin America. ", "Margin performance was generally satisfactory apart from the heavy impact of the hurricane season on North America and higher than usual third-party managed services revenue at low margins in Latin America due in part to the start up of the Burgos 7 contract.", "Among our technologies, growth was strongest for well services, wireline and drilling and measurement services.", "Looking at the areas in more detail, performance in North America was led by the Canada geomarket, as activities strengthened significantly following last quarter's spring breakup. Demand was strong for a range of technologies, from well services, wireline and drilling and measurements on land in the U.S., and improving weather in the North and expanding rig count across all geomarkets yielded a solid result. These positive effects were partially offset by a sharp reduction in activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico resulting from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike as well as by the seasonal slowdown in Alaska for rig and infrastructure maintenance. ", "In Latin America, sequential revenue growth was strong across the area, led by Mexico/Central America geomarket due to increased IPM activity. In addition, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador continued their robust performance of the second quarter on a more favorable mix of wireline and drilling and measurements technologies, while Brazil grew as exploration activity led to more demand for wireline logging services.", "Sequential revenue growth in the Europe/Africa/CIS area was driven primarily by activity in the Russian geomarkets, particularly in the East, with the summer exploration campaigns in the North and South. Through demand for well services, pressure pumpings remain strong as well. Exploration was also responsible for the strength in the Caspian through both activity and service mix. In Africa, Libya was particularly strong, as activity grew in both exploration and development work, and Western Southern Africa also recorded exploration-related growth. ", "These positive factors were somewhat tempered by a decrease in North Sea activity in both exploration and development that matched an effective rig count reduction. ", "In the Middle East and Asia area, sequential growth was led by Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines geomarket, with increased exploration activity resulting in robust demand for exploration led wireline and well testing services. The geomarket also benefited from strong completions product sales. Good results in Qatar came through service mix that outpaced rig count, while the East Mediterranean and Arabian geomarkets also saw improvement. The area's sequential growth was, however, blunted by a decrease in the Gulf as activity shifted from drilling to workover-type services. ", "At WesternGeco, sequential revenue grew significantly, led by excellent Marine results and a strong recovery in multi client data sales. The third quarter is seasonally the strongest in Marine, and the results were backed by strong activity in the North Sea and the transfer of three vessels from multi client to proprietary service during the quarter. ", "In multi client, increased sales were seen in North America, Latin America and Europe, with the result in North America underpinned by a significant sale in the U.S.  ", "Data processing also recorded higher revenue, particularly in Europe, North America and India. The positive combination of this performance, however, was partially offset by a decrease in land revenue, with activity reduced and contracts were completed in North Africa and Latin America. ", "At our investor conference on September 30th, we highlighted a number of unique Schlumberger technologies that both singly and together offer marked benefits in helping our customers improve performance and reduce risk. The manner in which these technologies can be integrated also offers substantial customer benefit, and a number of these were evident during the quarter. ", "I would draw particular attention to the StimMAP LIVE real-time fracture mapping and stimulation as well as to our full-azimuth Coil Shooting Q-Marine data acquisition as examples. I would also point out the continuing uptake of PeriScope and other members of the Scope family of technologies, with jobs performed in Texas, Alaska, Italy, Ecuador and Brazil. ", "As we enter the fourth quarter, the recent rapid deterioration in credit markets will undoubtedly have an effect on our activity, though we anticipate this will be largely limited to North America and to some emerging exploration markets overseas. The strengthening production profile of North American natural gas has also led a number of customers to reduce spending early. ", "At the present time, the rate at which the world economy will slow has become increasingly uncertain. We have always maintained that the one event that could slow the rate of increase in worldwide exploration and production spending would be a reduction in the demand for oil caused by a severe global recession. At the moment it is still too soon to predict to what extent current events will affect global activity in 2009, but we anticipate a slowing in the rate of increase of our customers' spending.", "However, the weakness of the current supply base, the age of the production profile, and the decrease in reserve replacement ratios - all of which we have indicated on many occasions\u00a0 are such that any significant drop in exploration and production investment would rapidly provoke an even stronger recovery. ", "Schlumberger has an unparalleled technology position, a strong balance sheet, an unmatched global presence, and an excellent and highly motivated work force. I have no doubt that we will emerge from the current turmoil even stronger than before.", "We will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Anderson - UBS.", "David Anderson - UBS", "", "Andrew, I was just wondering, just looking at International land, is it fair to say the majority of your projected 2009 business is already locked up, either through contracts or long-standing agreements?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Specifically land, Dave?", "David Anderson - UBS", "Yes, just International land.", "Andrew F. Gould", "I would say for the drilling programs that certainly the first half year to nine months are locked up. As you know well, that's not true for workover programs. In other words, they're on a much shorter time scope and could eventually be canceled. ", "David Anderson - UBS", "And then if I look more just towards offshore work, is it fair to say there'd be probably a much larger percentage of that locked up because it can be linked with drilling contracts?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. I mean, I think that the fundamental cycle of three-year contracts overseas hasn't changed a great deal, so you can assume that one-third will rollover in 2009.", "David Anderson - UBS", "But with the contracts that are existing in place, can you envision any scenario in which you start to see contracts being broke? I think that's a pretty big concern in the investor community right now.", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, the operators don't break contracts. They shut down rigs. You know, normally a contract is for a specific or an envelope of rigs, and they can always shut down rigs within the contract. So it depends on the drilling contract, Dave.", "David Anderson - UBS", "And then if I could just ask one more question, looking back when oil prices peaked back in 1998, it looks like it took something like 12 months until OPEC activity really started to come down. I'd like to get your perspective on whether we should start to expect a similar pattern on OPEC and other NOCs this time around. I recognize there's a lot of changes in the market and there's not a perfect historical comparison, but perhaps you'd just give us your perspective as to how long you think it's going to take or how long oil prices have to stay low until you really see a dramatic reduction in their spending.", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think I would be dishonest to say that I know. I don't know, but I will give you my opinion. ", "My opinion is that this is 1998, but the same basic rules would apply and the period of time before they meaningfully impact activity is probably not dissimilar from what you just quoted, Dave.", "David Anderson - UBS", "So you think something like 12 months or so from the peak, just roughly. You think 12, 15, something like that?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. It depends because there's no such thing as two OPEC members who behave the same way, so it's very, very generalized, what I'm saying.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co.", "Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co.", "", "Andrew, I just want to understand a little bit better your thoughts as they are today. Maybe six months ago, a couple of conference calls ago, we were looking at International as a 15% to 20% kind of top line growth market for you guys in '09. I realize we don't know at this point, but I'm just trying to understand order of magnitude around your comment on the rate of growth slowing. Do you think it's - I mean, are we a single-digit growth rate now? Is it a few hundred basis points softer? Kind of ballpark for us.", "Andrew F. Gould", "Dan, I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know. And we're going to take this quarter by quarter, but today I have a little bit better visibility on North America because you know as well as I do what's been happening very day. But on overseas, I just don't have a good visibility to allow me to look at a number.", "Dan Pickering - Tudor Pickering & Co.", "I guess the follow up then would be for both North America and International, you're talked historically about kind of Plan A and Plan B. Plan A is usually the markets continue to grow as you expect. Plan B is they soften. When do you pull the trigger on a Plan B in North America or on International? I mean, what's the timing? Walk us through the thought and evaluation process?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that Plan B in North America, we will be thinking in Plan B mode unless the temperature drops and heating days become such that it's obvious that gas supply, coupled with the cuts that people have made in expenditure, means that we're going to get to the end of the winter with a low storage situation. But today we're certainly thinking in Plan B mode. ", "So Plan B mode means that we're careful on headcount increases, we're careful on Capex. We're extremely careful on discretionary expenditure. But we have, you know, when we have Plan\u00a0B in place, we're working on Plan A at the same time. So if something does change in the spring, we can react.", "Overseas, it's very, very different because no two areas behave the same, therefore we can't, if you like, apply a universal plan the way we can to North American gas. So I would say that the Plan B overseas, we haven't evoked any of it yet. We are being more careful. You know the areas we'll make a Plan B other than when things start to become a bit clearer. ", "But, you know, I have to say, between Simon Ayat to myself and Chakib Sbiti, this is the third time we've been through this.

We have established credit lines committed from the banks, although unused, about $2 billion. Our cash flow this last quarter, if you noticed, we made almost $1 billion after spending $1 billion on Capex. We never rely too much on the credit market. We did - so opportunistic when we felt that it is more cost-effective to borrow than using our cash. So we're going to live off our cash flow like we did before, and we don't see this credit market to be very severe as far as our needs for cash because we have a good balance sheet and we also work very conservatively.", "Now as far as the receivables are concerned, we haven't experienced any delay in collections. Now this might start to affect us if there are delays for payments by our clients, but we know how to handle this and we mobilized our entire organization to make sure that the cash flow continued to come through.", "So we don't have any immediate concern over the credit market.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "And even specific, you mentioned receivables, any counterparty risk in terms of customers, issues related to their letters of credit, anything coming back your way?", "Simon Ayat", "We do reestablish the credit limits on some of the smaller clients, and the relationships with the normal, usual clients are contractual. And we have no issue with it for the time being.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "Second question, Andrew, if I can put it to you, pricing in the business I think is in general predicated upon maintaining a perception of scarcity. As we start to talk about lower utilization rates for everything from rigs to tools, etc., we lose some of that scarcity premium. Can you maybe talk about the mix shift in terms of revenue growth over the last few years, price versus technology? You've used in the past an [IEA] chart showing 70% of the [MP] Capex as being inflationary. ", "I would assume that Schlumberger doesn't have that kind of price inflation embedded into its revenue growth over that time frame, but I'd like to get a sense from you in terms of where you feel vulnerable in terms of pricing. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Right. If you go back, I don't have to explain the dynamics of supply and demand on North American pressure pumping, I hope, but if you look more broadly across the segments in which we participate, they are not generally wholly driven by pure supply and demand. Obviously they are to an extent, right? So if you look across well services in North America, we know the answer. ", "Overseas, we've had similar dynamics in the pricing market in Russia for the last two years, supply/demand. If you look at wireline, drilling and measurements, I think that yes, there is, particularly in drilling and measurements, an element of pricing, particularly in 2006 which was purely supply/demand driven and it was also true to a certain extent for wireline, though to a lesser extent. But in the last two years I would say that in those services it is technology that has driven pricing more than pure supply/demand.", "Now I have to say as a word of caution that in tight markets when money is short, our customers tend to use a little bit less technology and it's up to us to prove that using technology is cost-effective for them. But I think that the answer to your question is that the big price sensitivity to inflation in the services where we participate, apart from pressure pumping, was really in 2005 and particularly 2006.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "Andrew, you highlight the credit environment and how certain of your customers are - they're not able to spend the same amount of capital as they otherwise would, but how about some of your competitors and particularly North America stacked up competitors in pressure pumping in wireline and workover. I mean, we've seen an army of these little companies enter the market over the past couple of years with huge ambitions and borrowed money. Are you seeing any signs that this is getting shut down now?", "Andrew F. Gould", "To be perfectly honest, no, not yet. I haven't seen any distress signals, Ole. You mean real distress selling type signals, right? ", "I think we are getting more phone calls than we got three months ago. I think we can see some deals that were made that are probably in negative equity territory and how those will unwind I think is still completely unknown. But there's not an avalanche yet of distressed people calling or sending people around to sell us stuff.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "Well, they've [inaudible] the offshore market? I mean, you highlighted quite a few offshore rigs that were coming into the market. It appears that a lot of these rig projects are relying on a lot of debt and very little equity and very few of them have gotten funded. Have you had any thoughts about how that could develop?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think it's going to - I think that both for seismic boats, by the way, and drilling rigs that the people who were financing these at the margin, they're not going to build them. They won't get built until their shipyard slot gets bought by a serious player. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "So on the seismic side, again, I certainly see your point there, but in terms of your own revenues, exploration Capex was meant to be the driver of much of the growth over the next couple of years. Historically, '98 for example, exploration Capex was one of the first things to get shut down. Could you discuss a little bit your [expulsion], how you see the seismic business or the wireline business evolve over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Andrew F. Gould", "So I think that the seismic business will undoubtedly be affected, but there are two ways that it can be affected. The first way is that, if operators decide to slow programs, in which case it will be moderately affected, not catastrophically. The catastrophic scenario is they start going into M&A activity. So if my customers start buying each other, then they shut exploration down altogether for a year or so while they evaluate the portfolios and the re-decide what they're going to exploit and all the rest of it. So yes, there is a risk that exploration revenue in the next year goes much lower. ", "But I am now going to restate the caveat, and that is that the supply balance is extremely fragile. Nobody knows how deep the drop in demand is going to be, but there is a limit to the drop in demand unless we have a sort of worldwide depression that's going to last 10 years. ", "And to the extent that - Dave Anderson's first question - if they shut down worker activity, non-OPEC production is going to start sliding even faster than it is at the moment. And to the extent that they shut down exploration now, they are going to increase the reserve replacement problem that the customers already have, and I'm not just talking about IOCs, I'm talking about everybody.

Gould", "Well, Bill, I hate to do this to you, but I'm not going to answer your question directly because I consider that as almost proprietary information. But it's not regionally, it's the type of customer you need to look at. So that's why North America is such a pure market, is because the customers rely on capital mechanisms to fund activity. ", "So, you know, then if you look across to the North Sea, there is a whole group of customers in the North Sea now who rely on capital markets to fund activity, and, as you know, there were a lot of small companies on the A market in London that grew up on the basis of funding from capital markets. It's a little bit true in some parts of the Far East, and it's certainly true on the West Coast of Africa today.", "But, you know, beyond that I really don't want to go into how I think the various NOCs or big guys are going to react.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Well, let me get this reaction from you. In the current environment, where we've had a retrenchment in oil prices and it's a much less certain macroeconomic environment, isn't it reasonable to expect really almost across the board, even from an NOC standpoint, that the sense of urgency just abates a bit at least?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I totally agree with you, but the reading of a sense of urgency will be different in function to the type of customer.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Next line of inquiry, North America.

I mean, they've already adjusted lower significantly. How much lower can they go from here? ", "Andrew F.

Gould", "The question though is - ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Well, but - ", "Simon Ayat", "The cost of operation is going to go down as well.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Yes, but I mean, I guess the difference is so - here's what I mean:  We already had an adjustment here from your North American margins compressing from, call it, north of 30%, to in the low 20s. A lot of that came from pricing, and I'm just - you know, clearly absorption is going to get hurt with regard to an activity adjustment; some pricing as well. But I guess, you know, how severe will the rate of margin compression be in the event of a fairly meaningful pullback from this point forward? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Look, I can't say more, Bill.

Gould", "Well, I think the step down due to lack of funding is going to be balanced against the production performance of many customers in that area, which means that they really can't afford to step down a great deal.", "I think that the inflation in the area is everything. It's materials as well as - particularly - as well as wages. And that will abate. I mean, it's quite obvious it's going to abate in some of the larger items right now, particularly in materials. Wages, I'm not so sure. ", "And I don't really want to comment any further than I've done in the past on the entry of other competitors into the IPM business in Latin America.

Gould", "Yes.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "If we look at maybe technology sort of niche opportunities that are in need of capital, would they be more outside?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I would say they could be either in or out.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein.", "Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein", "", "Andrew, given the low level of visibility you seem to have on 2009 EPS and cash [inaudible] share and the fact that we obviously have down oil and gas prices and a weak credit market, do you not think it's prudent here to be cutting Capex more aggressively in the expectation that the environment could possibly worsen further?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, as I've said on several occasions this morning, we have a six to nine-month cycle, so basically that means out of the six to nine months, 80% of that has already been ordered and therefore - we're not in a phase yet where our needs are so low that we start to cancel that. But beyond that we have not finalized a plan. But yes, obviously we're taking into account what we think the activity scenario is likely to be.", "Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein", "And just on a last macro question, you talked about the 1980s. In the 80s one of the things we'd seen was that the supply really turned out when the rigs and service capacity turned up. And we've seen in the gas market recently supply growth turn out when the [inaudible] of the service capacity's turned up. Do you think there's a genuine risk here that we get to 2009, 2010 and we have significantly more supply growth than most of us have estimated because that's when the capacity for services and rigs actually hits?", "Andrew F. Gould", "In oil?", "Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein", "Yes.", "Andrew F. Gould", "You're assuming that people keep spending?", "Ben Dell - Sanford Bernstein", "Well, I'm assuming that margins drop and volume improves.", "Andrew F. Gould", "That's possible, but it's a long, long way from stabilizing. In other words, it's going to, you know, it's - the run up we've had in the last five years has been so inflationary that in fact if you relate the amount spent to the number of wells drilled, the activity increase has not been that huge. ", "Now to the extent that prices drop and that the customers spend more and activity increases, yes. But you're really talking about beyond 2010.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call.

Please go ahead sir.", "Malcolm Theobald ", "", "Thank you [Shelly]. Welcome to today\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2008 results conference call for Schlumberger Limited. Before we begin I\u2019d like to review the logistics and format of today\u2019s call.

A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. ", "And now for the call participants and format. Sitting with me for today\u2019s call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew\u2019s overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the financial results. After the opening comments, we will open the call for questions.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "", "Thank you Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Schlumberger\u2019s fourth quarter income from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.03 per share, down $0.22 sequentially and down $0.08 compared to the same quarter of last year.", "As announced, we are taking actions to reduce our global workforce as a result of the recent decline in activity in the Oilfield Services sector. We therefore recorded an exceptional charge of $0.08 per share during the quarter primarily to reflect these actions and create a solution relating to a client with liquidity issues. Depending how the market situation evolves, further actions may be necessary.", "Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue fell by 2% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue dropped 33% sequentially. Oilfield Services generated $1.6 billion in pretax operating income, down $100 million sequentially with margins slipping by 117 basis points to 25.6%. By area, Oilfield Services pretax operating margin highlights were as follows. My comments are on a sequential basis.", "North America pretax margin improved by 115 basis points to 22.3% with a strong offshore recovery in the Gulf of Mexico after the hurricane impaired third quarter and strong activity in U.S. land west and in Alaska. These increases were partially offset by the impact of pricing pressure in the U.S. land central and U.S. land north geo-markets. ", "Latin America pretax margin declined 211 basis points to 18%, with lower activity levels in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo-market, and unfavorable activity mix in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and Mexico central geo-market.", "In Europe/CIS/Africa, pretax margin reduced 295 basis points to 26.1% as Russia experienced its seasonal decline in activity offshore in Sakhalin combined with significant reductions in activity in other areas due to lower customer spendings.", "Less favorable revenue mix in the North Sea and Nigeria and Gulf of Kenya geo-markets also reduced area margin. ", "Finally, Middle East/Asia pretax margin declined 199 basis points to 33.5% on lower oil activity and less favorable technology mix in the Arabian and India fuel markets.", "WesternGeco pretax income of $88 million reflected a decline in pretax margins of 25.1 percentage points to 14.7%. Marine decreased from direct third quarter results through lower vessel utilization and a high number of transits while the low level of multi-claim sales depressed margins significantly.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate before the impact of the exceptional charges was 21.5% which was in line with last quarter. The ETR is expected to be in the low 20\u2019s for 2009.", "Net debt was $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter, presenting a sequential improvement of ", "$600 million. Further we ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $1.8 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remain unused and were available at the end of December.", "This compares to short term debt of only $1.6 billion reflecting the continued strength of our balance sheet and leaving us with more than enough liquidity to meet all corporate and operational requirements. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $154 million of the stock buyback program; $234 million of pension funding; and $1.25 billion of CapEx including $83 million multi-client surveys capitalized.", "During the quarter we bought back 2.7 million shares for $154 million at an average price of $57.05. Given the current credit and economic environment, we anticipate that the total dollar amount of stock repurchases in 2009 will be significantly less than the $1.8 billion spent during 2008. This anticipated reduction will serve to increase Schlumberger\u2019s financial flexibility during these uncertain times. Our stock buyback activity during 2009 will continue to be targeted to offset any dilution caused by our stock-based compensation programs. ", "", "Oilfield Services CapEx is expected to approach $2.2 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco CapEx is expected to reach $800 million in 2009. This includes $385 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels. And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould", "", "Thank you Simon. Good morning everybody. Oilfield Services full year 2008 revenue of", "$24.28 billion increased 20% versus 2007, driven by area growth of 28% in Latin America; 24% in Europe/CIS/Africa; 18% in Middle East/Asia; and 11% in North America. All technologies experienced double-digit growth, most notably in well services, drilling measurements and wireline.", "Sequentially, however, Oilfield Service revenue declined in the fourth quarter, largely due to the weakening of many local currencies against the U.S. dollar, as well as to lower activity in Russia and with the exception of North America generally weaker activity around the globe. This general weakness was partly due to seasonal weather affects and partly to initial client curtailment of spending. As a consequence, with the exception of North America, pretax operating margins declined.", "Looking at the areas in more detail, sequential performance in North America was led by the U.S. Gulf of Mexico geo-market, as activity recovered from the slowdown of the hurricane season in the third quarter and as higher, ultra deep water rig comp led to strong demand for wireline well testing and well services technologies.", "On land, revenue in the U.S. land west geo-market increased on demand for well services and drilling and measurement services and artificial lift products, while the Alaska geo-market saw a seasonal build-up in activity that resulted in robust demand for well services and drilling and measurement technologies.", "Also on the positive side, Schlumberger Information Solutions experienced growth from seasonally strong year-end software and hardware sales. These increases however were partially offset by the U.S. land central and northern geo-markets, where the reducing rig comp that accelerated in the [courser] end resulted in lower revenue.", "In Canada, revenue was lower primarily due to the weakening Canadian dollar. Sequential revenue in Latin America fell, with activity for wireline and well services technologies and completions products in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo-market decreased and as the Mexico/Central America geo-market suffered lower activity and integrated management operations.", "These decreases however were partially offset by strength in the Brazil geo-market from higher offshore expiration related demand for wireline, well testing and drilling and measurement services, and in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador geo-market from strong demand for artificial lift and information solutions products.", "Overall area revenue was reduced by an estimated 4% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. In Europe, CIS, and Africa, sequential revenue declined by 5% due to the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar, particularly in the North Sea, continental Europe and Russia. Russia also saw significant reductions in activity from lower customer spending, in addition to the seasonal slowdown in Sakhalin. ", "Activity however increased in the Libya geo-market with strong oil demand for artificial lift products and for drilling and measurements, well testing and wireline services. The continental Europe geo-market also grew with higher demand for wireline and drilling and measurements technologies.", "In the Middle East/Asia area, revenue decreased as a result of seasonal weather related effects in the Australia/Papua/New Guinea/New Zealand and in the China/Japan/Korea geo-markets. Lower activity in [Gata] as projects were completed and less favorable activity mix in Brunei/Malaysia/Philippines, and reduced customer spending in China, Japan, and Korea in the Arabian geo-markets all affected revenue.", "While these declines primarily affected wireline drilling and measurements and well services activity, they were partially offset by growth in the Gulf geo-market for artificial lift products, well services, and drilling and measurements technologies. ", "At WesternGeco the sequential 33% decline in quarterly revenue was largely due to decreases in marine which was affected by vessel transit, dry docks and project start ups. Multi-client revenue also decreased significantly as customers reduced discretionary spending. Margins suffered in consequence. At the end of the year, however, WesternGeco benefited from an all-time record backlog of $1.8 billion, underpinned by a number of long term contracts.", "The sharp drop in oil and gas prices due to lower demand, higher inventories and the belief that demand will erode further in 2009 as a result of reduced economic activity, is leading to rapid and substantial reductions and an expiration in production expenditure. At current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources are not economic to develop.", "It would also take time for inflation to be removed from the system and to bring refining and development costs more in lower with lower oil and gas prices. We therefore expect 2009 activity to weaken across the board, with the most significant declines occurring in North America natural gas drilling, Russian oil production enhancement, and mature offshore basins.", "Expiration of offshore will be somewhat curtailed, but commitments already planned are likely to be honored. Seismic expenditures, particularly for multi-client data, are likely to decrease from last year and pricing erosion will compound these effects on revenue. In this market we are taking the necessary action to adjust our operating cost base while preserving our long term commitment to technology to element, key skill sets, and service and product quality.", "The key indicator of future recovery in Oilfield Services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand for oil. The recent years of increased expiration and production spending have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation. The age of the production base, accelerating decline rates, the smaller size of recently developed fields will mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will sow the seeds of a strong rebound.", "We have no doubt that Schlumberger will emerge from the current downturn a stronger company, better positioned to participate in the subsequent upturn. And I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.", "Malcolm Theobald", "", "Thank you Andrew. We will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Andrew, I was wondering in your view how does this cycle compare to other cycles you\u2019ve experienced in your career? Would you put this more closely aligned with the \u201997 to \u201999 period or more like the \u201980 to \u201986 period?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Actually I think it\u2019s a bit different from both because the precipitous drop in the oil prices combined with the contraction of the general economy. So actually the biggest difference I see from both sort of the mid-80s and as well as \u201997, \u201998 is the speed with which everybody\u2019s reacting. Our customers are reacting at a much faster pace than they probably did even in \u201997, \u201998 which was a very sharp cycle. ", "I mean my general comment is these cycles as I experience them are getting much sharper in their amplitude and shorter in their duration. Now of course that depends on the general economy. But I would say the big difference that I see so far is the speed with which everyone\u2019s reacting.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Just in the prior periods it always had taken longer for the international markets to adjust to the changes relative to North America and a lot of that has to do with long term contracts, but again on what you just said about your customers acting more quickly, do these contracts still provide that chance that the international markets could bleed lower and extend out into 2010? I don\u2019t want you to get specific but just trying to get a general \u2013 I\u2019m trying to handicap it myself, so I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to bleed lower like we did the last couple cycles or if you think \u201909 is really the ultimate trough here.", "Andrew Gould", "", "I think the simple answer is I don\u2019t know. I think that our customers they are not going to break contracts but they are going to pressure us to swap price for volume or price for duration or things like that. So where they have an opportunity they\u2019re definitely going to act on price. But I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re going to break contracts.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs.", "Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs", "", "Andrew, I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about your conversations with the national oil companies. I know they all probably have different goals and breakeven points on various projects, but if you could generally just talk about what you\u2019re seeing from them. They\u2019ve obviously accumulated a lot of cash over the last few years. How are you seeing them spending through this cycle?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s very difficult to generalize on them like that. But you know the ones that are mixed, in other words they have some private ownership, I think they will react to very much as private industry does. The ones that are entirely state owned, if they have cash I think they will spread out their programs but I doubt they will cancel them, because they don\u2019t want to really compromise their long term position in this industry. So I think that there\u2019s a very mixed reaction.", "But if I had to generalize it, if they can spread their programs over a longer period of time they\u2019re likely to do so.", "Charles Minervino - Goldman Sachs", "", "And can you just give us a sense globally or internationally? You talk about a little bit at the markets that you see, and you mentioned earlier Russia slowing down. Can you touch a little bit on Latin America and the different parts of Europe where you see maybe holding up a little bit better versus slowing down a little bit more?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well I think Latin America will be a mixture. There are at least two geo-markets in Latin America that will remain very healthy and two that will probably weaken fairly dramatically. So I think overall there is a good chance that Latin America will be flat, flattish over the whole year. But it\u2019s very early for me to commit to that, but that\u2019s the way we would see it today. If you look at Europe then you know parts of central Europe will hold up, the North Sea will weaken, a lot of weakness \u2013 actually almost all of our weakness is quartered in North Sea came from the devaluation of the pound against the U.S. dollar.", "But it will weaken over the year. If you look at Africa we see some Bolivia, Nigeria, North Africa access will hold up pretty well. And offshore West Africa the big guys will hold up really well, but some of the small independents who were doing expiration will probably drop off. So you know there is a reasonable \u2013 I think overall I have to \u2013 I hate to go on being negative, but overall I suspect Europe, Africa, CIS will be down. And there will be pockets of strength with the big customers offshore, Algeria, Libya, but the rest will be fairly weak.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "Andrew if I could ask you to clarify your comment on the inflation and the unwinding of it, particularly I think when we think F&D inflation we tend to think oilfield pricing and clearly the biggest components there were rigs and steel, two businesses you\u2019re not in. So first I guess clarify that with respect to oilfield pricing. And then secondly, how you could be actually benefiting from inflation unwinding in terms of Europe.", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well, actually my remark was you don\u2019t drill without a rig and you don\u2019t build a platform without steel. So the really high inflation ticket items in projects are undoubtedly what our customers are going to want to come down. Now the traditional arm wrestling with the rig contractors and how they run one, I know what that\u2019s like, will take some time to work itself through the system. That\u2019s what I meant, Michael, okay?", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "Okay.", "Andrew Gould", "", "The steel stuff, the input to our manufacturing be it steel, [kanel], chrome, copper, the pricing effect is fairly immediate. As soon as we\u2019re through our inventory we see the pricing effect come in very quickly. In fact we have some of our IPM contracts with the tubular element price has been dropping by a very substantial amount on a monthly basis. So I think \u2013 but for it to really work its way through our system, in terms of material costs you\u2019re probably looking at a year.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "I\u2019m not putting words in your mouth then to say that this was not a statement about your own pricing structure?", "Andrew Gould", "", "No. No. Our pricing structure will be negotiated, renegotiated as I explained in answer to an earlier question. But for my customers it\u2019s getting the cost of the really big ticket items down that\u2019s going to make projects become economic again or not.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Allan Block] \u2013 Bank of America.", "Allan Block \u2013 Bank of America", "", "In a slowdown the next kind of focus usually moves to the receivables. I wanted to know if you could comment on recent pressure the Port of Vaasa owing somewhere near $8 billion and they stopped paying. Are there other areas in the world where you\u2019re seeing this type of pressure from your customers where they\u2019re running out of money and extending you on the receivable side?", "Andrew Gould", "", "No, not significantly. I think there\u2019s a bigger risk from some of the smaller independents than there is from the other international companies. Terms will undoubtedly extend, they always do in a downturn. But since I\u2019ve been in this business we\u2019ve never not been paid by anyone.", "Allan Block \u2013 Bank of America", "", "When they stretch out they do \u2013 usually they catch up on them \u2013", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well, never say never but when I first joined Schlumberger one of the NOC\u2019s didn\u2019t pay us and they paid us seven years later. But Simon we\u2019ve never not been paid, no?", "Simon Ayat", "", "No, I confirm. As a matter of fact in the Q4 we improved our receivable situation. That\u2019s part of the improvement in net debt that I spoke about.", "Allan Block \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Your expectations are then that most will stay current right now, or there like I said before are there areas in the world where you\u2019re worried about this happening as well?", "Andrew Gould", "", "We\u2019re not, no we\u2019re not. We haven\u2019t seen any \u2013 well we\u2019ve seen an improvement as Simon said. But if we look at specific companies I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any significant deterioration yet that leads us to worry. I have to say that we put our field people on credit watch back in September, so they have been doing a lot of quality operating of the customer exposure since last September.", "", "Allan Block \u2013 Bank of America", "", "Given the changes in the dynamics of demand, are you changing your marketing or pricing strategies at all in any particular markets?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t want to say that over the phone. My competitors are undoubtedly listening. But yes everybody has to adapt to the current market circumstances.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "Andrew, just going back to what you said about coming after this downturn and a stronger company, what is your reflections of how the whole cycle is playing out? And is there any specific Schlumberger there relative to competitors? And will there be consolidation or market share gains into that?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I think it\u2019s much easier for companies with very strong balance sheets to operate in this environment because we can still make investments that we think are going to pay off in the long term. As I said last October we will be more opportunistic in acquisitions than we\u2019ve been perhaps during the period when we felt that valuations were out of hand. And generally we will not \u2013 we never adjust our R&D in any significant way during these downturns which means that when you turn up again, you have been able to renew a considerable part of your product and service portfolio.", "So if that recipe still works, that\u2019s what I meant, Ole.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "What do you think of the terms that when we come out of this downturn that the competitive landscape will have meaningfully changed?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I don\u2019t know. I mean I think that \u2013 you can see already that some of the smaller companies that went with private equity are struggling, so they may get snapped up. Whether there will be a larger consolidation I don\u2019t know, Ole.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "If I can just move onto block 31, it was kind of buried in the middle of the press release. And by the way your press release seems to be particularly aggressively sprinkled with the contract awards on technology this time around, so just wondering if we should read anything into that specifically. But particularly block 31, could you talk a little bit about just you seem to have gone sort of full house there on the service side and what part of that was incumbent and what was new awards?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I actually don\u2019t know off the top of my head. I certainly know that wireline was incumbent. I\u2019m not sure about drilling and measurements, and well services we were partly incumbent. I would say we were incumbent on quite a lot of this. But don\u2019t forget, this is moving to the development stage so the scope is very different.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "And then you\u2019ve been successful in completion in deport in West Africa versus some of your previous competitors. Has completion been awarded yet on block 31?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "Has that been announced?", "Andrew Gould ", "", "I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s not in our press release so it\u2019s not us, Ole.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from J. David Anderson \u2013 UBS.", "J. David Anderson \u2013 UBS", "", "Andrew getting back to some of the past downturns, I\u2019m just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on applying some of the lessons you learned during the last downturn to now. Just curious if that was a factor in the timing of your decision to cut your workforce. I guess my question is did you move the timing up because your outlook is really becoming more negative and your looking at the past and you decided to make a decision here?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Actually when I compare the way we\u2019re managing that to \u201997, \u201998 we actually today have much, much better data. That\u2019s the first difference. The second difference \u2013 and data about our own workforce, I mean. Where it is, who it is, you know \u2013 what the loading is, all the rest of it. The other thing is that in previous cycles, including \u201997, \u201998 we used to listen to our customers about what we thought was going to happen in the market. And since then where we suffered really badly from listening, we make up our own minds.", "So I would say that the decision that we had to make a workforce cut was probably made in November. And you know the actual \u2013 we don\u2019t make press releases about these things but the cut actually concerns about 5,000 people worldwide.", "J. David Anderson \u2013 UBS", "", "So have you become incrementally more negative over the last two months?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes.", "J. David Anderson \u2013 UBS", "", "You also talked about the speed of the spending cuts being faster than in past downturns.", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes.", "J. David Anderson \u2013 UBS", "", "Do you see much of a difference between the IOC\u2019s and the NOC\u2019s reacting right now? And is this more of a credit issue? I mean I\u2019m hearing it seems like credit can be more of an issue than commodities. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any way you can comment on that.", "Andrew Gould", "", "I think credit is an issue for the sort of ecosystems that grew up, particularly in the London A market, maybe in Russia a bit and also in the U.S. where people spend. You know I don\u2019t have any cash flow like the expiration companies in London who traditionally spent 125% or 150% of their cash flow as the case in North America. So obviously the credit crunch has had an effect on the speed of the contraction, yes.", "J. David Anderson \u2013 UBS", "", "With regards to the offshore sector you talked about a lot of contracts in place, you keep that work out there. Just wondering if the customers have their rig rates locked in already and they\u2019re looking to cut costs in other ways, does that mean it comes down to you guys? Are you guys starting to get a lot of pushback on your pricing right now? And how is your pricing structure offshore? I mean, how flexible is that?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well I mean of course we\u2019re going to get pushback from the pricing. But the factor in the pricing of an offshore development is tiny compared to some of the other ones. And what they will do is some of the big, new expensive rigs that were slated for expiration will be moved to development if they can\u2019t get out of their contract. Because an expiration rig does not produce cash flow. A development rig does.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "", "Russia not getting a whole lot of attention with regard to the potential I guess production response to the implosion and drilling activity that we\u2019re seeing real time. Can you comment on that in terms of what you\u2019re seeing ground level and what your expectations are as the year unfolds with the continued collapse in rig activity?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I think from the reports the production is dropping now. I think that were drilling activity to remain as low as it\u2019s been coming for a year or so it would be a very significant decline in production. I don\u2019t want to give a number, but a very significant decline though.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "", "Could you \u2013 again, a difficult question to answer because it\u2019s about depth and duration, as you look out into 2009 what are your expectations with regard to a year-over-year decline in [inaudible] capital spending in Russia on a percentage basis, if you will.", "Andrew Gould", "", "Actually we haven\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t \u2013 so you have to divide the Russian market into three. The IOC\u2019s particularly in Sakhalin there will be no decline. The small Russian companies that depended on credit markets will probably just not drill. And what we\u2019re looking at at the moment the hypothesis we\u2019re working on is that there will \u2013 I can\u2019t give you this in money, but in the total meters drilled we\u2019re looking at a drop of somewhere between 10 and 20%. Total meters drilled.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "", "That\u2019s for the whole market.", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes. For the \u2013 essentially for the western Siberia and southern Russia market. Let me put it this way, Bill, the mature market.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "", "I would suspect that the pricing pressure that the service industry is encountering in Russia is fairly acute, no?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes it is.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "", "We have a decent slug of new build [inaudible] vessels coming into the market this year, the eastern eco-boats. What is the plan with regard to your resisting fleets, your older vessels? Do we plan on stacking those or mothballing or do you not know at this stage?", "Andrew Gould", "", "No, actually when we bought Eastern Eco we made a contingency plan. We didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have to use it but we may have to use it. And if we do have to use it the first thing is we still have some leased vessels and luckily a lot of those lease vessels we can release in \u201909. That would leave us with almost 100% owned fleet and in that case if we have to stack we will park them in a field somewhere.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "", "With regard to your receivable policy I hear you with regard to national oil companies eventually making a hole, but what is the policy with regard to the carrying value of these receivables on the balance sheet? Is there a certain threshold at which you have to start writing them down, call it six months to a year?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I\u2019ll let Simon comment but we have a policy, yes.", "Simon Ayat", "", "So basically we have a policy where we look on an item by item basis. We don\u2019t take general provisions. We do analyze our receivable divided by areas. Geo-markets have very good visibility. And we look at our receivables item by item basis. So we don\u2019t take a general provision like we announced now. We took a particular provision that related to a specific client. And this is how we look at it. So we don\u2019t have a general policy that based off on aging. It is more particular to the client and what we know from the client and the discussion with them and the timing to be paid.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company Intl.", "", "So for example if you were to have some vulnerabilities attended to NOC yet they historically have made you whole with regard to receivables, how would you \u2013 how would the carrying value of those receivables adjust if any?", "Simon Ayat", "", "We will look at our experience with the NOC, the discussion that\u2019s ongoing with them. And we\u2019ll make the decision on those basis. Now if it goes beyond a certain timeframe, yes, a prudent accounting approach we might take a provision. But this again would be dependent on the circumstances.", "Andrew Gould", "", "Bill, historically the payment patterns of our NOC customers tend to get reflected in the pricing we practice.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities.", "Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities", "", "Andrew you speak to pricing erosion and your U.S. land central and north geo-markets. I\u2019m assuming that refers primarily to well simulation or are you also concerned we could see it in some of your other product and service lines in those specific geo-markets?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well essentially those. It would be pressure pumping.", "Byron Pope - Tudor Pickering & Co. Securities", "", "With regard to your Oilfield Services CapEx being down roughly 28% year-over-year, historically your CapEx spend has been fairly consistent with kind of your revenue mix. As we think about that decline year-over-year is it fair to think about North America bearing more of the brunt of the reductions? Or is that not a fair characterization?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes, I think that\u2019s probably a fair characterization. Yes. The brunt no, but proportionately more yes.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from James Crandell - Barclays Capital.", "James Crandell - Barclays Capital", "", "Two questions. One, I understand that Pemex intends to move forward with as many as eight, 500 well packages that Chicontepec in 2009. Could you comment on that? And also talk about when your contracts expire, when you end your current stage of work at Chicontepec?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well the only [co] ones I\u2019m prepared to comment on are the 8TGE three and four, which have been announced. Beyond that I\u2019m not prepared to speculate on what Pemex might or might do. And we have \u2013 our current contacts actually we have been awarded some extensions to make up for some of the shortage of wells that Pemex feel they have, and therefore I think our Chicontepec contract with its extensions will carry us through most of this year.", "James Crandell - Barclays Capital", "", "Secondly and I was even given all your explanations I was still surprised over the magnitude of the drop in seismic profitability relative to the revenues. Could you perhaps expand on that? And given where you were in the fourth quarter, where would you see the overall direction of profit margins from the fourth quarter levels in your seismic [inaudible]?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well I think you have to remember that the third quarter is the strong quarter in the North Sea, and the North Sea has the highest seismic pricing in the world. So you\u2019ve got a compounded effect of the boats moving to lower priced contracts outside the North Sea, transit times, and you also got \u2013 we had a number of boats in dry dock during the fourth quarter. So I \u2013 the magnitude is surprising. I agree with you, but it\u2019s quite logical. There\u2019s nothing particularly startling. I mean obviously in a port where you have transits and dry docks you can\u2019t reduce your fixed costs very much in marine.", "The other portion of it was the, which we had somewhat anticipated, was the absence of multi-client both in North America and overseas during the fourth quarter.", "James Crandell - Barclays Capital", "", "So some of this at least going forward at least should lessen, so would you expect overall your relative profitability in that business in terms of margin should improve over the next couple of quarters?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 Q1\u2019s not a good proxy like Q4 but certainly in the second quarter yes.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Presumably the cuts that you put in place in terms of headcount expense and CapEx stem from your planning process. At that level of employment and spend what does that imply or what are you planning on in terms of activity levels? Just trying to get a sense for where your head\u2019s at and are you staffed for that expected level or is there just kind of a Part B if things deteriorate further?", "Andrew Gould", "", "While we obviously have an overall plan at the level of Schlumberger Limited, as a feel for people\u2019s visibility beyond Q2 it\u2019s still very poor. We\u2019ve asked them to make a plan in two parts. So first half year plan, second half year plan. And we will revisit the second half year plan in April, May. The headcount adjustment we made now which as I pointed out in an earlier question was planned in November was to adjust to what we felt activity levels were likely to be in the first quarter if not half year.", "Now in fact we\u2019re seeing \u2013 the situation is so dynamic, that I cannot rule out that we would not make another headcount adjustment in the first half year. And secondly depending on what comes in as the plan in April, May for the second half we will probably have to look at it again.", "It\u2019s so dynamic that I\u2019m not going to say that an adjustment we made is for anything beyond the visibility we have over the next three to six months.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "And shifting back to the seismic business, at least one good day to point there to backlog up again. Roughly how long does that carry you? Does that get you halfway through \u201909, through three-quarters? ", "Andrew Gould", "", "Actually what happened is Dalton and I agreed earlier last year that the time was to go long. And so roughly half that backlog will be executed in \u2013 no, slightly more than that, sorry. North of ", "$1 billion is in the next 12 months and the balance will be in the following year.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "", "Just to pick up on that last question if I could. You clearly have a great deal of confidence in WesternGeco backlog. Can you help us understand why?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well, because with the exception of one or two contracts who are with very reputable contracts, the work has already started.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "", "And you feel like once they start they\u2019re going to complete the program as originally conceived?", "Andrew Gould", "", "We\u2019re talking about very reputable companies breaking contracts. They might shorten the program but I don\u2019t see them breaking contracts, Geoff.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "", "Could I ask you to just elaborate a little bit on the comment in the press release about at current prices, most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources are not economic to develop. What are you referring to in terms of new categories of hydrocarbon resources?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Advanced EOR, Ultra Deep, Heavy Oil, [Tarsands], let alone coal to liquids or gas to liquids. There\u2019s a very good graph, Geoff, in the International Energy Agency 2008 Outlook that shows the cost as of the time they did it in November, which each of these categories can be developed.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "", "And then kind of a follow-on, the deep water market \u2013 what are you expecting? You made a couple of comments already this morning. There are a lot of new rigs coming out. Do you expect that deep water activity, defined however you want to, will in fact increase in \u201909 versus \u201908 with the [inaudible] new rigs?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes. Yes. Definitely. I think some of the rigs as I said in an earlier question will be pushed \u2013 instead of doing the expiration they were planned for will be pushed for development because development brings cash flow. But I don\u2019t see any huge reduction in the deep water commitments that people have already undertaken. I think it\u2019s far more a question for 2010, Geoff.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "", "And the combination of volume increase but a mixed shift for development translates to an impact on Schlumberger how?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well, we don\u2019t make as much money in development as we do in expiration as you know. So you know to the extent that there is a shift \u2013 the service intensity in development is much less than in expiration. So it actually reduces our scope to sell to a certain extent.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Brad Handler - Credit Suisse.", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "", "I guess first question I come back to the U.S. market, can you give us an update on kind of the contract renegotiation status? You know a year ago we heard a lot about the process of negotiating pricing particularly in pumping but I think it was broader than that for the U.S. market for the coming year and it sounds like that has been delayed to some degree. Can you update us on that?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I think that it\u2019s best to say that customers knowing they were going to lay down rigs and therefore would have more bargaining power pushed out the contact renegotiation into much later than they normally would have done. I would think that we\u2019re probably about 70% through it now for the key product lines, yes.", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "", "So just to key on that, to the point that we will start to see the impact of those discussions in Q1 or is it more of a Q2?", "Andrew Gould", "", "No, I think you\u2019ll see them in Q1. But you know sorting out the effect of the new contracts from the drop in rigs and all the rest of it is going to be quite complicated.", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "", "On a relative basis versus the prior year for a percentage of work and again your comment makes it more complicated to answer this, but to the percentage of work that you expect will prove to be under some form of contract versus the spot market?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I don\u2019t think it will change very much, no. So you know 60, 70% will be under contract. Now what the scope of those contracts is going to be, I don\u2019t know because rigs are dropping so fast it\u2019s difficult to tell.", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "", "Are they presumably of the same nature? Are they sort of covering a certain area? For what work is done, here\u2019s the price \u2013", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes.", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "", "Can you comment \u2013 would you be willing just to make a comment if the consensus EPS is sitting at $3.50 can you comment on how you all feel about that consensus number, just to try to get it out there?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Well, given the way I\u2019ve been talking this morning, I suspect that the consensus number will come down from $3.50.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "", "Simon, there was a decent sized jump in the post-retirement benefits line. I wondered \u2013 I guess I hadn\u2019t really looked at it and so maybe it\u2019s been moving up through the year, but I wondered what the explanation for that is. Is that a number that goes higher in \u201909?", "Simon Ayat", "", "So there\u2019s two explanations for that. One big part of the increase was related to a decision we made in the fourth quarter to convert a pension scheme we have for our international mobile staff from a defined contribution to a defined benefit. In other words, we given the market condition, we felt that we would take the risk and convert it to a defined benefit. It was a target benefit associated with the average carrier.", "Now the other part is no secret. It\u2019s the value of the assets due to the market condition dropped. Now overall including the international mobile pension plan, we are about 70% funded. So this is why you see this big shift between the two layers.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "", "So then obviously x stock market conditions, the number now of the $2.37 billion is representative of where you\u2019re going to be going forward?", "Simon Ayat", "", "Well, I mean, this would be dependent on the first as you said the value of the assets, the market condition. But we also plan to fund some of these shortfalls. In a few quarter we put some money, $230 million and we have spare money to fund the different plans during 2009. So it will be hopefully less.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "", "And then is the aim \u2013 you know, obviously huge uncertainty here in terms of how far down, but pretty still lower but fairly robust CapEx program. Is the aim to be cash neutral this year or is that possible I guess in the [inaudible] environment?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Let me comment on that, Kevin. We planned to be cash neutral but we have a lot of options to stay very cash positive.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "", "And would that include cuts in CapEx?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes. Did you hear him explain we did an H-1, H-2 plan? So we do the H-2 plan in May we\u2019ll look at the CapEx again.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "", "So actually post the 1Q conference call.", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "", "Just a little bit of follow up on seismic. If you could talk about sort of the difference in you commented about it, a rapid decline in library demand but yet the increase in the backlog. Is it customer mix or is it basically a data driven demand?", "Andrew Gould", "", "No, the backlog is not \u2013 there\u2019s very little multi-client in the backlog. The backlog is marine and land acquisition or third party processing. Actually there is a very interesting difference between this cycle and the last down cycle in seismic. Because the last down cycle in seismic, WesternGeco had a balance sheet library value of approximately $1.1 billion. And this time it\u2019s less then $300.", "Simon Ayat", "", "It\u2019s $282.", "Andrew Gould", "", "It\u2019s $282, and the multi-client that we are going to shoot through the first two-thirds of this year is already very adequately pre-funded. Because you know one of the dangers of the seismic business is everyone goes off and starts shooting multi-client without funding. I think this time around most of the seismic companies\u2019 balance sheets are such that they won\u2019t do that unless they have pre-funding.", "Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "", "My follow on to it relates to the margins and I imagine just from the magnitude of the revenue contribution from the marine versus the library, but the margins in the library significantly better because of the depreciate just as you point out. Was that a large contribution to the decline, the decrements, because of less library? Or really all driven mostly by they had dry docks and transit times?", "Andrew Gould", "", "I think it\u2019s far more driven by the choppy quarter in marine, you know. The fact that we had dry docks and transits and you can\u2019t cut the fixed costs when you\u2019re just moving boats around.", "Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast, Inc.", "", "As pointed out earlier that\u2019s the biggest driver, depending on \u2013", "Andrew Gould", "", "Yes. Yes.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup.", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Andrew as you plan for the North America \u2013 the continued drop in North American activity you mentioned that this downturn is different from previous ones in several respects. Do you expect a kind of a B-shaped bottom to the North American drilling decline as we\u2019ve seen in the last two downturns? Or is this something in your mind possibly very different?", "Andrew Gould", "", "The answer, Robin, is I don\u2019t know yet because so much of what happens in North America is going to depend on a recovery in industrial [inaudible] I guess. And there are some things out there that could make it very positive. For example, if the new administration decommissions some coal-fired generating plants, that could increase gas demand fairly dramatically. The other unknown is what is the true decline rate of some of these new Shell Gas horizontal wells? So the answer is I don\u2019t know at this point in time. But I would say the key factor is when demand starts to recover.", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citigroup", "", "On all the various currency impacts that you mentioned, and I assume some of the big ones are the pound, Canadian dollar, the Russian currency, do you have a aggregate impact of based on various markets of what that was in the negative sense in the most recent quarter?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "", "Basically we highlighted the impact of the currency on the top line. And the fact is, we don\u2019t have impact of those currencies on a profitability. Our as a matter of fact, the stronger dollar overall is a slightly positive for us. But definitely on the top line as you highlighted, certain countries like Canada and North Sea, we have a high portion in the local currency. And some other markets much lower. But overall we are quite balanced between the income between these currencies and our costs and on a profitability basis there is no impact.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "I appreciate the opportunity to follow up and it\u2019s related to CapEx. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the priorities of the $2.2 billion in Oilfield with respect to replacement capital, new technology deployment, project related, etc.", "Andrew Gould", "", "There\u2019s an awful lot of project related deep water CapEx. There is a lot of CapEx related to gas overseas. And after that I would say those probably if you like the new categories, Michael, then I would say its replacement and new technology.", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "", "So if I think about a Plan B on the CapEx side in the second half it would really be subject to potential deferrals on gas and deep water, probably the biggest areas?", "Andrew Gould", "", "Probably. Yes.

Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Paris where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. ", "Before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.

After the prepared statements, we will welcome your questions.  ", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Simon. ", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter income from continuing operations excluding charges was $0.68 per share, down $0.10 sequentially and $0.48 compared to the same quarter of last year. We continue to actively manage our cost base. In this regard, we have continued to reduce our headcount which resulted in charges of $0.07 in the quarter, primarily relating to severance. ", "Additionally, as a result of these workforce reductions, we were required to record a non-cash pension and other post-retirement benefit curtailment charges in the quarter of $0.10. These headcount reductions are expected to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter. ", "Turning to the business segments, oilfield services second quarter revenue fell by 9% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 1%. ", "Oilfield services generated $1 billion in pretax operating income, down $233 million sequentially with margins declining by 245 basis points to 20.6%. ", "By area, oilfield services sequential pretax operating margins highlights were as follows. ", "North America declined to 1% on the heavy pricing pressure  across most of the area and the sharp drop in activity, primarily in U.S. land and in Canada. The sequential margin decline is equally attributable to U.S. land and Canada. ", "Internationally, margins were at 25.1%, a decline of 170 basis points from Q1. ", "Latin America decreased by 206 basis points to 17.6%, primarily due to a less favorable revenue mix coupled with cost inflation in Brazil, currency revaluation losses and pricing pressure in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, and the impact of the lower activity in the Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobego. These decreases were partially offset by the increased IPM activity in Mexico Central America. ", "Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 24.2%, which was 172 basis points lower than last quarter, primarily due to the lower activity levels and less favorable revenue mix, Nigeria and [Gulf of Guinea], West and South Africa, and the North Sea. These decrease were partially offset by an increase in Russia as a result of the improved activity levels. ", "Finally, Middle East/Asia slipped 107 basis points to 32.1%, primarily as a result of the lower overall activity in the area. ", "At WesternGeco, pretax income was $97 million, reflecting an increase in pretax margins of 739 basis points to 17.3%. The increase was primarily due to higher multi-client sales and improved profitability in marine as cost reductions initiatives more than offset the impact of the lower revenue. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges was 18.2%, and including the charges it was 19.8%. The rate was lower than last quarter due to the substantially lower proportion of pretax earnings in North America. The ETR for the year is expected to be in the lower 20s. As a reminder, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings and as such, we may experience volatility on a quarterly basis. ", "Net debt was $990 million at the end of the quarter, an improvement of $537 million from Q1. This improvement was driven by strong cash flows from operations. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.3 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused and well available at the end of June. This compared to short-term debt of only $1.6 billion, which includes $321 million of our convertible debentures, which are now classified as short-term. ", "Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $503 million of CapEx, $229 million of pension funding, and $186 million of acquisitions. We did not buy back any of our stock during the quarter.", "Oilfield services CapEx is expected to approach $1.9 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco is now expected to reach $530 million, which includes approximately $225 million relating to the construction of seismic vessels. ", "In summary, our balance sheet remains very strong and provides us with a significant amount of financial flexibility. ", "And now I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Andrew. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Schlumberger's second quarter revenue fell 7.8% sequentially to $5.53 billion. Compared to the first quarter, the overall sequential rate of revenue decline slowed as a further precipitous drop in North America was offset by slowing rates of decline and some recovery in other parts of the world, including Russia, where revenue recovered noticeably due to seasonal trends and improving activity. ", "In North America, gas drilling in both the U.S. and Canada reached a five-year low as demand remained weak and storage levels remained way above the seasonal averages. While production has begun to show some decline and summer demand has been strong, it will still require a further substantial increase in demand, particularly in the industrial and power generation sectors to stimulate and sustain higher levels of drilling. ", "Looking at the areas in detail and starting with North America, the U.S. land geo-market recorded a further steep drop in revenue as the rig count declined approximately 27% and as pricing continued to erode. ", "Revenue in Canada also dropped significantly due to the impact of the seasonal spring break-up, the general reduction in land drilling activity, and the effect of significant pricing pressure. ", "In the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, however, revenue fell more modestly as lower pricing and further weakening on the shelf drilling activity were partially offset by slightly higher deepwater activity. ", "In the Latin American area, the Venezuela, Trinidad, and Tobego geo-markets were the sharpest sequential revenue decrease as a result of lower activity and a  revenue deferral pending finalization of certain contracts. This decrease, however, was somewhat offset by an increase in the Mexico and Central America geo-market as integrated project management activity and efficiency both increased. ", "With Europe/Africa/CIS, revenue in Russia grew sequentially on the seasonal rebound of offshore activity in the East among generally improved activity levels in both East and West Siberia. This growth was also supported through higher sales of artificial lift and completions products. ", "In North Africa, revenue grew from strong demand for testing services and completions products. These promising factors, however, were more than offset by reduced demand for drilling and measurements and wireline services in Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea in West and Southern Africa geomarkets, in addition to lower drilling and measurements in well services activities in the Caspian and North Sea geomarkets. ", "Lower Schlumberger information solutions software sales, as well as reduced demand for drilling and measurements, wireline and testing technologies in Continental Europe also contributed to the overall area sequential revenue decline. ", "Lastly in the Middle East and Asia area, sequential revenue fell primarily due to lower activity in the Gulf geomarket, as well as in the East Mediterranean, Arabian, Indonesia, Australia, Papua New Guinea and India geomarkets. Pricing pressure also began to impact revenue across the area. ", "These decreases, however, were partially offset by an increase in revenue in East Asia on strong exploration related demand for testing services, wireline, and well services, and a rebound in activity in the China, Japan, Korea geomarket following the winter slowdown in the first quarter. ", "At WesternGeco, there was some recovery in multi-client sales both in North America and overseas, although this together with increased activity in land, was offset by weaker Marine revenues. Marine pricing continued to decline due to excess capacity in the market. ", "Several new marine and land contracts were booked during the quarter, giving better visibility on the next few months. However, multi-client sales remain difficult to forecast until there is better visibility on year-end oil prices. ", "Against this background, we have continued to take action to right-size our operations without diminishing our capacity to react to market changes. Overall our operating cost base declined approximately $300 million compared to the first quarter as cost reduction programs continued to be implemented. ", "Careful management of both working capital and investment led to the liquidity improvement that Simon described. ", "Our outlook for the remainder of 2009 assumes some stability but no major increase in North American natural gas rig count before 2010 and as a result, service pricing will remain depressed. Overseas, further activity declines will occur but will be limited, while the pricing concessions made in the first half of the year will affect revenues in the second half. The current volatility in the oil price makes it unlikely that our customers will sanction any major increases in expenditure. ", "We are aware that a number of projects are continuing to be postponed or cancelled. We are also concerned that higher finding and development costs of new supply, coupled with lower oil and gas prices and more restricted credit markets, is stifling investment flows. This situation, if it persists, will lead to inadequate supply when demand growth returns. ", "The shape of the economic recovery beyond 2009 and the consequent recovery in oil and gas demand remain the determining factors for future activity increases.

", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I don\u2019t think my thoughts have substantially changed. If there is an element of doubt in predicting beyond the end of the year, it is the fairly rapid recovery that is taking place in the oil price. As I said in the comments this time, I think that there\u2019s too much volatility in the oil price at the moment to sanction much increase in spending but if at the end of the year it persists at the higher end of the range that we\u2019ve seen so far this year, then I do think that it might, if you like, not lead to the same reduction in activity next year that I was perhaps originally thinking of. ", "But it really, really, does depend on where the oil price is at the end of the year and not where it is now. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That\u2019s great, I appreciate that color. Now, my follow-up is you made some explicit reference here to some deferrals of revenues in Venezuela and we know obviously the mess that country has been. Can you give us your updated view on what you see as the prospects of any recovery in Venezuela? And can you update us on the receivable situation there, please?", "Andrew F. Gould", "During the quarter, we made very satisfactory progress on the receivables situation. And we also made considerable progress on the renewal of three major contracts but we were not able to book the revenue in the second quarter because the actual inking hasn\u2019t been done and therefore there was a fairly large sum of -- fairly large amount of revenue that was deferred to the third quarter. ", "As to the overall levels of activity in Venezuela over the coming months, it\u2019s a little early for me to say what I think [Pedevesa] is going to do but certainly the general situation in terms of receivables and contracts has shown a marked improvement over where we were at the end of Q1.

Morgan", "If I could ask quickly on the OGX contract, and maybe talk about the differences between this structure and a typical IPM contract and whether or not there are other offshore opportunities like this out there?", "Andrew F. Gould", "So the difference is that whereas what we are providing in the OGX contract is very similar to what we would provide in a classic IPM, obviously the size of the amount and the risk involved means that we cannot take the same risk as we do in land IPM contracts. So this is somewhere between IPM and bundled services. So there\u2019s not perhaps the same scope for incremental due to performance but the actual rate, the remuneration is a lot better than it would be in a basic IPM contract and we are providing a lot of the technical services around the development, as we would do in IPM. ", "And yes, there are other opportunities of this type. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "In terms of market size, if I think about IMP opportunities on land versus this type of thing offshore, is this an emergent market, is this a big market that is just -- you know, you get a little bit of share into? What\u2019s the penetration rate? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think there are two -- so firstly, I don\u2019t think this is a huge market. It\u2019s obviously a very profitable market because it\u2019s deep water. I think that the market falls into two types of market. The first is the OGX type where there is a definite wish to harness this Schlumberger technical expertise. The second type where this occurs is the remote market where a customer doesn\u2019t have any infrastructure whatsoever and rather building a complete infrastructure, so this would typically be more in exploration or the delineation than in development, they will ask Schlumberger to manage a lot more of the process than we would in a normal offshore operation. ", "Michael LaMotte - J.P. Morgan", "Great. Second question on Russia -- I\u2019m intrigued by your comments that the improvement was not just seasonal. Would you care to elaborate and perhaps talk about how you would characterize Russia today in the recovery?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that -- to be honest, there were two events which are not seasonal. The first is the fact that the Ruble exchange rate improved considerably against the dollar. And the second is that the Russian oil companies who count in Rubles, obviously their first quarter results were huge. Therefore, there is more cash to invest and perhaps a greater willingness to invest than there was in the fourth quarter of last year. ", "So I think that it\u2019s probably very definitely sustainable through the rest of this year; in addition, I understand there\u2019s a probably change in the tax law, so I think that while it\u2019s not going to be gangbusters, there is the scope of considerably more investment in Russia than we originally thought.

Andrew, you mentioned that it sounds like you are quite concerned about the 2010 cost outlook for oil supply, given the current delays in investment trends that you are seeing out there. Would you care to elaborate a little bit more because we just had the IA come out and increase their estimates on an OPEC production and could you just sort of talk a little bit about how you might differ or agree or what you see?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well actually the thing that worries me more than anything else, and that\u2019s why when I answered Kurt\u2019s question, I stressed the level of the oil price so much, is our customers\u2019 cash flows because even our very largest customers are having to borrow or dip into their war chests to sustain their spending and they will only go on doing that for a certain period of time. And therefore if we don\u2019t have a fairly substantial improvement in the oil price, or by the end of this year then the risk is that the cash flows will be such that they will not actually increase at all in 2010. So that\u2019s why I am so insistent that it hinges on the level of the oil price at the end of this year. ", "Now, in terms of supply, you have seen the easy stuff go away, the heavy oil and the tar sands and all the rest of it, which is a fairly substantial chunk of production that was originally included in the 2012 estimate, and I think what we  are seeing now is a very definite caution on the part of our customers which leads them to postpone fairly substantial projects and if they don\u2019t see an increase in their cash flow, they are going to go on doing that and my point is that if that happens, it\u2019s just going to accelerate the supply decline and if that occurs at the moment when demand starts to grow, the crossover could be quite valid. ", "I don\u2019t comment on the IEA\u2019s forecast. ", "Ole\u00a0Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, so if the oil price continues to drift higher with an economic recovery gaining traction, under that scenario how do you see the outlook?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Then I think there will be some time in 2010, and please don\u2019t try to tie me down to the exact day, Ole -- some time in 2010 our customers will gain sufficient confidence to start to rebuild activity. But please don\u2019t -- I do not think that\u2019s in 2009 and I do think that\u2019s in function of the oil price and their cash flows as they see them going into 2010.

Gould", "I think that the capacity to do the integration is going to lead to a higher value, multi-client product and therefore a better priced multi-client product.

", "Andrew, getting back to the roadmap, if you will, for non-North American margins, recognizing that 2010 is certainly opaque and there\u2019s enough uncertainty with regard to the remainder of 2009 but quarter on quarter, you are down about 170 basis points internationally. By year-end, what do you expect within a range, the margin contraction to be into non-NAM realm? And to sort of frame it for you, Andrew, just very quickly, one of your peers suggested that international margins would be down 300 to 500 basis points within the next two to four quarters and I\u2019m just curious as to whether you ascribe to that view. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unreasonable position to take. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Okay. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don\u2019t know whether they will go that far but that really is going to depend a great deal on what -- if you say two to four quarters, it\u2019s really going to depend a great deal on what activity looks like in the back-end of that. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Right. Because if I recall correctly here, the first quarter, your prophecy for non-North American margins was a typical eastern hemisphere correction, if you will, 18 months taking to unfold, margins down basically 50% from the recent peak, which would imply margins somewhere in frankly the high-teens and margins to bottom either first quarter or second quarter of next year. And if you are suggesting 300 to 500 basis points from here and you are thinking that that could be on the high-end with regard to the rate of margin contraction, it sounds like you are a little bit less -- what\u2019s the right word -- I guess pessimistic with regard to where margins are going to bottom. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think in what I know today, that\u2019s -- for the rest of 2009, it is probably reasonable to assume I am a little less pessimistic. However, I would put this big, big rider on whether or not that we have another leg down in 2010 because activity -- because our customers\u2019 cash flow or our customers\u2019 consolidating, or whatever else they do, means that there is another leg down in activity in which case, I would become much more pessimistic. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Co. ", "Understood. Second question relates to North American margins -- I mean, clearly everybody is sort of enduring a lot of duress for reasons that we all know. You are taking a lot of costs out of the system. The North American, at least the U.S. recount is groping for a bottom; Canada, seasonal recovery. It looks like most of the pricing woes are behind us, although you are going to get some quarter on quarter flow through. Should we expect margins, assuming that activity basically is not going to take another significant leg down, that margins have essentially bottomed for you in North America?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I am going to be very bold and say that Canada will improve on the basis of some modest seasonal rebound and North America I don\u2019t think will go any lower.

I just want to clarify a comment that you made, Andrew, in your remarks where you talked about -- or I think Simon maybe said  that Canada and the U.S. contributed equally to the correction in margins from Q1 to Q2. Is that -- does that mean they were both down the same amount in dollars or percent or I just -- it would make a very big decline in Canada if it was the same dollar amount. ", "Simon Ayat", "No, it\u2019s in the percentage term, Dan. If you take the drop that we experienced from Q1 to Q2, the major part of it is split equally between Canada and U.S. land, yes.

And then Andrew, last quarter I asked you about whether or not we could make more money in 2010, Schlumberger corporate entity than we did in 2009 and you said it didn\u2019t seem logical that you would. As I look at the world today, oil prices are better, as you mentioned. North America is maybe a little bit worse. Pricing issues, there\u2019s a lot of mix issues going on for Schlumberger. I mean, has your view changed? Is it not logical to make more money next year or is it now possible?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, an awful lot will depend what happens in North America, because we could hardly make less. And then again, it comes back to all the -- everything I said to everybody else about what is the oil price going to do towards the end of this year. I mean, there is one element of this cycle that we don\u2019t understand yet and it\u2019s a logical element in every cycle and that is what do our customers do when their cash flows really start getting crimped? So the hedge has run out, they need to go to the bank or cut their dividends or whatever else they need to do to fund their projects. Do they do that or do they cut their projects?

Can you comment on what you are seeing here and how that might impact geo markets?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think actually you need to segregate it more by customer than by type of project because the IOCs have been very quick to react and quick to implement price negotiations, whether it be off-shore activity or land activity. So it\u2019s more, if you like, where you have strong concentrations of IOC activity that we -- that the price concessions have been greatest than by any particular type of activity. That\u2019s why, for example, you take somewhere like the U.K. sector of the North Sea or West and Southern Africa, which is largely dominated by large companies, that the pricing pressure is a lot greater.

So generally, we will favor a managed services approach. ", "In terms of [Chinkotep], we have an exposure which I would not want to increase. I feel quite comfortable where we are for a  number of reasons and therefore I\u2019m not surprised -- and I\u2019m not at all surprised to see more and more contractors trying to break into that market. ", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated ", "", "Thank you, Andrew. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wagar\u00a0Syed with Tristone.", "Wagar\u00a0Syed - Tristone Capital", "Andrew, could you comment on the timing of Saudi gas initiatives, when do you think they could pick up rigs as they have laid off some oil rigs but on the gas side, they\u2019ve been talking about it. When do you think that actually could materialize?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think there already has been a considerable shift of rigs, land rigs to gas exploration. That\u2019s taken place. It took place in the first quarter on the end of last year and offshore, there is no doubt that the bulk of the rigs and any increase they do in offshore rigs is going to be focused on gas development, as they have a number of reasonably successful discoveries. So I don\u2019t think -- I think it\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t think ", "it\u2019s about to come. ", "", "Wagar\u00a0Syed - Tristone Capital", "And in terms of revenue per rig, how does that compare in Saudi Arabia between oil well and on a gas well, how does the revenue and margins kind of change between the two?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, like anywhere else, if the gas wells tend to have more revenue per rig, not necessarily the same percent, level of profitability or return on sales, and in terms of Saudi, in terms of oil wells, it depends very much what type of oil well you are talking about. If you are talking about a 6,000 foot development well on [Gola], the revenue is not very high. If you are talking about a very complex horizontal well on [Manufir], it\u2019s  a very different point of view. So you can\u2019t draw a general rule. ", "But as a general rule, the same ratio of better revenue on a gas well applies in Saudi Arabia as it does anywhere else. ", "Wagar\u00a0Syed - Tristone Capital", "Okay, and then on [unconventional] gas outside of North America, what are you seeing in terms of activity and how do you -- when do you think it\u2019s going to become a material business? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that there\u2019s no one answer. For example, you can see already that a lot of the coal bed methane work in Australia is already being tendered. If you are talking about shale gas, North America type, the cost of development overseas is going to be very different from what it is in North America. And the chief reason is because North America already has the most developed oil field service infrastructure in the world and therefore rigs, frac fleets, water carriers, all the rest -- and the availability of water for this  business is something that\u2019s very well understood, whereas that is -- with perhaps the possible exception of Germany and Austria, that is not at all the case overseas and therefore we think it will happen but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to spread everywhere very fast. If it does start reasonably quickly, we think it\u2019s probably going to be in Eastern Europe. ", "Wagar\u00a0Syed - Tristone Capital", "And how about the [tight] gas initiative in Saudi? Is that -- how advanced is that? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Sorry, what do you mean?", "Wagar\u00a0Syed - Tristone Capital", "Saudi Arabia was looking at drilling the [tight] gas reservoirs and has the process started -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, we have had a tight gas center of excellent in our research center in [Dahran] for over a year now, staffed largely by specialists from North America, so -- I mean, we consider that something that is thoroughly underway. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "Could you please speak to the CapEx, modestly lowering of CapEx guidance for \u201909 relative to last quarter? Are we looking at cost savings or have you made some adjustments to the CapEx program?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think we are largely looking at back-filling with transfers from idle CapEx in other markets. And I don\u2019t think you can talk about cost-savings yet. I do think actually that it is possible that that continues and it drifts a bit lower over the balance of the year. ", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s helpful. That seems to make sense on the oilfield side. On the seismic side, the WesternGeco, are you deferring some of the CapEx on the new vessels?", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, we\u2019re not hurrying but we are not deferring them -- we are completing them as and when it\u2019s reasonable to do so without incurring additional cost. So we haven\u2019t -- with the exception of certain vessels that we did not take delivery of on the leases, we are not deferring any of the CapEx on the owned vessel. ", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "And for the follow-up, or unrelated follow-up, on the M&A side, $186 million in the quarter, I think we saw a press release on [Texia] -- can you give us some information about -- I\u2019m going to guess that that wasn\u2019t all for [Texia]. Can you give us some information on what else you bought?", "Andrew F. Gould", "The rest was a couple of small technology related companies in Russia. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup.", "Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup", "Thank you. Andrew, I wanted to ask if in your comment about the postponement of projects, or delay or cancellation, do deep water drilling and development projects, are they also in that category?", "Andrew F. Gould", "They actually have been surprisingly resilient, so yes, we\u2019ve seen some postponement but not cancellation. So for example, we do see a lot of contracts that will actually come into operation in deep water in the second half of 2010 and in 2011. There\u2019s been very little actual cancellation. ", "Where there has been -- another movement which I think I talked about last quarter, Robin, is a shift from exploration to development on the basis that development produces cash flow. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup", "Okay, and just staying on that theme then, in your position, market share in deep water prospectively with the rigs that will be entering service over the next couple of years, how do you feel about your market share in various product lines with regard to the installed equipment and awards that may not have already been made?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I don\u2019t know about awards that have not already been made. What I can tell you is that on awards that have been made for known, for projects that are known and have been tendered, I am very, very satisfied with the market share that we have. ", "Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup", "Okay. All right, that\u2019s good for me. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pierre\u00a0Conner with Capital One.", "Pierre\u00a0Conner - Capital One", "Andrew, on the premise that your answer to Dan\u2019s earlier question about capacity in North America was excluding pressure pumping, I wanted to get your take on that, on North America pressure pumping capacity. Other players in this market have discussed retirements and would you care to talk about your plans?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I mean, we do some retirement and we are doing some mothballing, so -- and as I think my competitor described, that has a lot to do with the condition of the equipment and the cost of refurbishing it or not refurbishing it, and the fact that some of these massive frac jobs chew up equipment, as I think they put it, much faster than traditional fracs. ", "But today we have a mix of retirement and mothballing. ", "Pierre\u00a0Conner - Capital One", "And my assumption is that that retirement and mothballing then has increased with the current market and a shift towards higher intensity fracking?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yeah, and it\u2019s still going on. ", "Pierre\u00a0Conner - Capital One", "Okay, and then my unrelated follow-up actually is to do with the pricing in marine. I wanted to understand -- you know, you have a backlog and I am assuming you are executing against that backlog. Is there active renegotiation on contracts underway or -- help me understand the mechanics of that. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Actually, there has been very, very little attempt on the part of our customers to renegotiate seismic contracts that are being executed. They have of course pushed them out or trying to shorten -- where they can do it, shorten the duration but actually renegotiating price, they have not really been trying to do that, probably because they have a fairly clear optic of how far they are committed. But obviously when they re-tender or when they do tender, and in fact there is quite a surprisingly high level of marine tendering going on, then they expect much lower prices. ", "Pierre\u00a0Conner - Capital One", "Okay. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "So the backlog is being renewed but at a much lower price, Pierre. ", "Pierre\u00a0Conner - Capital One", "I understand. Thank you, gentlemen. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of  Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Thanks. So Andrew, I am going to ask you a very macro question, an opinion which maybe you\u2019ll want to duck -- is that price that you are speaking of in and around $60 for West Texas or whatever light sweet crude which would give them a $10 cushion, or can it be somewhat lower?", "Andrew F. Gould", "In my opinion, it\u2019s higher, Kevin. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Higher than 60?", "Andrew F. Gould", "In my opinion, it\u2019s more like 70. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "So if we -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Because their costs have gone up, because they -- you know, borrowing costs have gone up, government tax take has gone up, 60 is okay but it\u2019s not going to lead to a rash of new activity whereas I think 70 might be a lot more encouraging. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Okay, and then an unrelated follow-up as well -- the uptake of your value-added technologies relative to prior down cycles, it seems like you are holding up better, maybe with the Petrel platform a little more integrated into the decision-making process. And then the same with a differential edge and data acquisition. I mean, would you -- what\u2019s your take on -- ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think so probably a bit better but not much, Kevin because our customers have become extremely cost-sensitive and therefore the first thing they do is tell their engineers they are not allowed to buy the bells and whistles. ", "But certainly in the domain of software, Petrel, the penetration of Petrel in the market continues to be extraordinary because it brings our customers immediate efficiency. It\u2019s not price sensitive because it brings them immediate efficiency. ", "But under more traditional services, I would say this is pretty much like any other cycle. ", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak & Co.", "Okay, so a little better on some of the incremental software. But okay, thank you very much. That\u2019s it for me. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [Guilome Delabe] with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.", "Guilome Delabe - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale", "I think my questions have already been answered, so no need to ask it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert\u00a0MacKenzie with FBR Capital Markets. ", "Robert\u00a0MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Thank you. Andrew, I have a question you may not want to answer, given the sensitivities but I\u2019ll ask it anyways -- there\u2019s been a lot of talk in Washington, the D.C. area here around potentially increasing regulation on hydraulic fracturing, still very unknown what the outcome is but can you give us a handicap as to where you see that issue going and the potential effects, i.e. potentially even positive or negative, positive potentially for wireline and other analysis tools and negative obviously on pressure pumping. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "I think that obviously the situation with natural gas in the United States is such that having discovered or unlocked this enormous, huge resource, there\u2019s going to have to be a solution to be found. Now, whether the solution will be positive or negative I don\u2019t know because the one thing you can be sure of is it\u2019s going to increase the cost. ", "To the extent that the solution goes through some form of reporting and monitoring and all the rest of it, I am pretty sure that it will get pushed off onto the service industry. But whether or not we will be able to charge for it I think is going to depend on market fundamentals. ", "But common sense normally prevails and unlocking this resource is a huge positive for the United States\u2019 domestic energy balance and therefore I am sure that some form of solution will be reached. ", "Robert\u00a0MacKenzie - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey", "Okay, thanks. That\u2019s all I had left. ", "Operator", "Thank you very much and that does conclude our question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call. I would like to turn the call back over to Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Kent. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2009 results conference call. ", "Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the third quarter and his comments on the outlook Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your questions. ", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. ", "Third quarter income was $0.65 per share, excluding the $0.17 of charges we recorded last quarter. This is down $0.03 sequentially and down $0.60 compared to the same quarter of last year.", "We continued to place a heavy focus on managing our cost base and have largely completed the headcount reductions that we announced last quarter. ", "Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services third quarter revenue was flat sequentially while WesternGeco revenue decreased 17%. Oilfield Services pre-tax operating income of $1\u00a0billion was the same as the prior quarter. Oilfield Services margins improved slightly by 41\u00a0basis points sequentially to 21%, as improvements in North America and Latin America were partially offset by slight declines in Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East/Asia. Overall, international margins in OFS were 24.7%. ", "By area, Oilfield Services sequential pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows:", "North America improved by 240 basis points to 3.4% on the increased activity in Canada following the seasonal spring breakup. This was partially offset by the impact of the decline in activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to operator caution during the hurricane season.", "Latin America increased by 70 basis points to 18.3%, primarily as a result of efforts to restructure the cost base in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo market and increased IPM activity in Mexico/Central America. These improvements were slightly offset by a decrease in Brazil due to start up costs for new contracts.", "Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 23.7%, 53 basis points lower than last quarter primarily due to lower activity levels and a less favorable revenue mix in the North Sea and West and South Africa geo markets. These decreases were partially offset by the impact of higher revenues in the North Africa geo market and the more favorable revenue mix in Russia.", "Finally, Middle East/Asia fell by just 32 basis points to 31.7% as the impact of stronger activity in the Arabian geo market and the favorable revenue mix in Indonesia were offset by effects of lower revenue in the East Asia, Qatar, and Gulf geo markets. In addition, we have begun to see the effect of price concessions across the area. ", "At WesternGeco, pre-tax income of $61 million reflected a decrease in pre-tax margins of 421\u00a0basis points to 13.1%. This decrease was primarily due to lower multi-client client sales. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 19.5%. This was higher than last quarter excluding charges due to less favorable geographic mix of earnings. As a reminder, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic of earnings, and as such we may experience volatility on a quarterly basis.", "Net debt was $660 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $990 million at the end of Q2. This improvement was driven by strong cash flow from operations. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition, $2.8 billion of committed debt facilities and commercial banks remained unused and were available at the end of September. This compares to short-term debt of only $1.2 billion, which, as a remainder, includes $320\u00a0million of our convertible debentures which will likely be converted to equity by the end of the second quarter next year.", "Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $467 million of CapEx, $363\u00a0million of pension funding, and $276 million for acquisitions and minority interest investments. Additionally, during the quarter we were able to issue $450 million of notes due in 2013 at an interest rate of 3%. The proceeds from this issuance will be used to refinance existing debt obligations. ", "Oilfield Services CapEx is still expected to approach $1.9 billion in 2009, while WesternGeco is now expected to reach $490 million. ", "Our balance sheet remains very strong and continues to provide us with a tremendous amount of financial flexibility.", "And now I'll turn the conference over to Andrew. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Good morning, everybody. ", "Oilfield Services revenue was flat with the second quarter as increases in both North and South America offset a further decline in the Middle East and Asia. As a result of this, coupled with the implementation of cost-cutting programs early in the year, overall margins increased slightly.", "In terms of technologies, revenue increases in IPM, testing services and well services were primarily offset by revenue declines and completions, drilling and measurements and wireline. ", "Looking at the areas in detail, activity in North America was unchanged sequentially as increased revenue in Canada from the muted post-spring breakup recovery was offset by decreased revenue in the United States. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenue was impacted by a slowdown in activity due to operator caution during the hurricane season and by a further decrease in shelf drilling activity as a result of the continued uneconomic natural gas equation.", "On land, revenue decreased as an improvement in oil-related activity was more than offset by pricing erosion in gas-related activity in the early part of the quarter. Alaska also recorded lower revenue due to a slowdown in activity for seasonal rig maintenance and operator budget constraints.", "Sequential growth in Latin America came from the finalization of certain contracts in the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago geo market that led to recognition of deferred revenue in addition to revenue from current quarter activities related to those contracts. Revenue also grew in the Mexico/Central America geo market from the start up of the AGG3 contract and from increased activity on other IPM projects.", "Europe/CIS/Africa was flat with the second quarter, where a combination of positive currency movements across the area, higher testing services product sales in North Africa, and stronger IPM activity in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea was offset by a number of factors. These included lower revenue in West and Southern Africa from reduced activity that primarily affected well services, a decrease in the North Sea from lower rig count and pricing that mostly impacted drilling and measurement services, and a fall in revenue in Libya on a reduced amount for testing services and well services technology as well as for completion products. ", "The North Sea revenue also decreased as a result of an incident in the Norwegian sector that resulted in a stimulation vessel being out of action for most of the quarter. The vessel re-started operations in mid-September.", "As I mentioned earlier, revenue fell sequentially in the Middle East/Asia. In East Asia, completion of several exploration-related campaigns led to lower demand for wireline testing services and well services. In Qatar, revenue decreased primarily due to the completion of several large offshore development projects that resulted in reduced demand for all technologies. In the Gulf geo market revenue fell on lower income that led to a decrease in drilling and measurements and wireline services. ", "East Mediterranean revenue dropped as a result of lower land activity that reduced demand for well services technology; however, these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the Arabian geo market revenue on strong gas-related activity that resulted in higher demand for well services and testing services. Weaker pricing also contributed to lower revenue. ", "At WesternGeco, sequential revenue declines were due to lower multi-client revenues in the quarter and the rollover of marine contracts from high-priced legacy backlog into newer lower- priced activity. The combination resulted in lower revenue and margins. ", "Recent contract awards demonstrate the value of Schlumberger's technology leadership and operational differentiation. These included an award in Denmark from Maersk Oil and Gas for open hole wireline under high pressure/high temperature conditions, in Russia for Artic Gas for a series of services north of the Artic Circle, in West Africa for subsea completion installations, particularly in Equatorial Guinea, and in the North Sea for Apache for electrical submersible pump systems based on previous excellent service delivery. ", "Two events during the quarter also demonstrated our continuing investment to support operations in growing regions. ", "First, in Saudi Arabia we announced the opening of a new reservoir completions manufacturing center in the Dammam Industrial City. Representing an investment of $25\u00a0million, the center houses a team of design and manufacturing engineers specialized in the production of down hole reservoir completions equipment. The center also provides a collaborative environment in which joint oil company and Schlumberger teams can develop and manufacture completion solutions for application across Saudi Arabia and the greater Middle East. The new center represents a further step in our infrastructure in the area, which includes the Dhahran Research Center opened in 2006 and the new Oilfield Services base in Dhahran commission in November, 2008. ", "Second, we also announced the signing of a joint cooperation agreement with Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro to build a key international research center on the university's campus. The center will focus on research and development activities in deepwater pre-salt environments, with emphasis on the development of geoscience software for the exploration of production center, new technologies to meet reservoir challenges in pre-salt environments, and the creation of a geophysical processing and interpretation center of excellence covering time lapse seismic and compliant electromagnetic and seismic measurements. ", "Our outlook for the reminder of 2009 assumes a continued modest recovery in North American gas drilling but no other significant improvement in service pricing. Overseas, while rig activity is stabilizing, seasonal factors, together with pricing concessions made in the first half of the year that are still being implemented, leave some risk of further small revenue declines. WesternGeco's improvement will depend on the level of fourth quarter multi-client sales.", "Looking further, we said in our second quarter outlook the shape of the economic recovery beyond 2009 and the subsequent recovery in oil and gas demand remain the determining factors for future activity increases. Since then, indications of inventory rebuilding across many industries, together with help from government stimuli, have helped to strengthen demand for both oil and gas. While uncertainties remain, notably the transition from current stimuli to industrial and consumer demand and the extent to which the recovery will be limited by high unemployment, the demand for oil and gas will increase somewhat over the coming months. ", "As a result, we see continuing stabilization of activity around the world; however, this will not be uniform across either geographies or for services by commodity type. We consider that world gas markets are oversupplied and will remain so for some time absent a strong recovery in industrial demand. Both new LNG capacity coming onstream, as well as ample storage and pent-up supply in North America, will serve to keep prices and activity low. In North America we feel the current slight recovery in drilling to be fragile and not likely to significantly improve service activity and pricing until late 2010. ", "For oil, the current robust price will lead operators to maintain their spending levels and this, coupled with the lowering of their cost structures, may produce some modest increases in activity. We see continued strength in deepwater areas and some increases in selected land markets. We also feel that a more robust commodity price will lead to some increase in seismic activity, although new marine capacity will continue to depress pricing. The worst, provided the economy continues to show signs of recovery, is behind us.", "And I'll now hand the call over to Malcolm.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Andrew. We will now open the call for questions. Kent?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Great. Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Andrew, if you could provide us with some perspective, if you will, on two markets, one, Mexico. Clearly a lot being discussed in the press and [inaudible] in a period of, let's say, contemplation with regard to Chicontepec. What do you think the likely path Pemex takes with regard to Chicontepec and overall activity in 2010? ", "And then secondly with regard to Russia, what are your expectations there going forward?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Let me answer Russia first because that's easier. We think that there will be a fairly substantial increase in feet drilled, which is the measure we use to judge activity in Russia. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "And fairly substantial means what?", "Andrew F. Gould", "High double digit, from 10% onwards, but pricing will mean that the actual revenue transferization of that will probably be about half.", "Now in terms of Mexico, everyone has read as much as I've read about the questions that have been asked by the new national hydrocarbons authority and by the congress, so I think there is absolutely no doubt that Pemex will come with a revised strategy for Chicontepec. I do not know what that strategy will be, and if I did I don't think I would be at liberty to say so on this call. ", "But I think that one should assume that when there's that amount of noise - and as you probably know, Bill, there are articles every day in the Mexican press about this - Pemex will have to look at their strategy.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "And then secondly with regard to seismic, you're waxing a bit more optimistic with regard to activity and sensibly so given what's happening with oil prices. Can you elaborate a little bit in terms of what you're hearing from your customers, tenders that you're seeing, and does your modestly improved outlook for seismic encompass both contract and multi-client? ", "Andrew F. Gould", "The answer to the last part is yes, contract and multi-client.", "What we're seeing in contract is the fact that, as you know, operators compiled large portfolios of new licenses during the last four or five years, and there are people who are wanting to do contract seismic because they have commitments and people who want to do contract seismic because they think they can take opportunity at much lower pricing to obtain seismic vessels or crews.", "And in terms of multi-client, it's always a poker game until the end of the year, but I agree with you that higher prices should give a fairly satisfactory level of spend on multi-client.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Equity income was up pretty sharply quarter-on-quarter. Do we know what drove that?", "Simon Ayat", "The equity income, we have two things on that line. We have the net interest expense and then equity from the minority shareholder, and this is just the usual thing. ", "No, I don't have the detail for the quarter-on-quarter. I'll look through it and probably by the end of the call we can give you color on it. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs", "Andrew, can you talk about the mix this quarter, especially in the Middle East/Asia, where the mix seemed to have gone against you with less exploration as well as the completion of a few offshore contracts, yet margins actually held up pretty well. What does this say about margins going forward as the mix potentially improves?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, if I can deal with the mix question first, Dan, our position in Middle East/Asia in exploration and development means that when rigs go down we suffer disproportionately perhaps compared to a lot of our competitors because of our presence in exploration and offshore development.", "And in terms of pricing, the Middle East has done a fantastic job of pulling in their costs. So despite the fairly substantial drop in offshore rig count, particularly for offshore development in Qatar, they've done a really good job of managing their cost base.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, but I would assume that the outlook for margins here is more positive than it was last quarter?", "Andrew F. Gould", "It will depend to some extent on how the rig mix evolves, but generally it should going forward start to be a bit better, the rig mix. ", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs", "On the last call you said $70 oil at the end of the year was the threshold that ENPs were looking for to take their budgets higher. We're now at $80, so could you give us some guess at what you would expect international spending to be up next year and what markets you might expect to be the strongest?", "Andrew F. Gould", "That's a long question, but let me deal with the first part.", "The first part, don't forget it's not the spot price of oil that encourages my customers to change their spending; it's the notion that an increase in the price has reached some level of stability.", "So last quarter I talked about $70 to $75, and I think today that most of my customers are still budgeting slightly below that. And I think that, if they gain confidence probably in the first half of next year that this price is sustainable, then they will increase spending. But today I think the increases we're seeing are inactivity based on their capacity to obtain more activity at lower prices within their existing budgets.", "So, yes, obviously $80 oil would eventually, if it stays at $80, lead them to increase their budgets. I don't think they're ready to make that call yet.

I also kind of wanted to get your thoughts on the recent reactivation of seven of the 35 halted OPEC projects and how this might impact the sector if suddenly all of them, plus the other NOC projects around the world, were greenlighted in 2010?", "Andrew F.

Gould", "The sustained or, if you like, moving forward of projects in Middle East OPEC for gas we're seeing very clearly. And for oil, no, I haven't seen any reactivation of a major project so far.", "But obviously if prices get sustained at these levels, some members of OPEC - and I think it's very important to say some - will increase their activity, but not the people who have large surface capacity.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "My follow up question to that would be how comfortable do you think the world should be with OPEC's 6 million barrels [inaudible] capacity?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Comfortable in what sense, Alan? Sorry.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "Being comfortable in it actually existing or it being under a level of decline while sitting there. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Oh, I think that the capacity in the countries where it exists is not going to be subject to an extremely fast decline, so the decline is more in other places than in the places where they have the surface capacity. ", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "That's kind of what I meant in the sense of it being the cushion.", "Andrew F. Gould", "Yes. No, I think the cushion is fairly intact. But that doesn't mean that reduced investment in other places will not eat into the overall production capacity of OPEC.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "And the other follow up I had was on the seismic side. Most people think of seismic as kind of rising in lead cycle and, given the state of oil and gas resources and demand - we ended sort of on a demand side, not on a supply side end of the cycle - I was wondering if you could provide some thoughts on the timing and magnitude of a seismic recovery if we kind of grind higher from here?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think that the seismic activity is even more sensitive to the absolute level of the oil price than the rest of oilfield services because seismic, particularly exploration seismic, is a cash expense; it doesn't bring any income.", "So I would say that the strength of the recover in seismic is really going to depend very much on the absolute level of the oil price going forward. But, as I said earlier, the capacity of the seismic industry to capitalize on that is going to be somewhat limited for a period of time by the new marine capacity that's coming into the market.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "Andrew, obviously a lot of moving pieces. If we just would assume that as we step forward into Q4 and Q1 and that revenues were flat, I'm trying to understand the cost-cutting impact. I know we're not doing more, but is there still some follow on impact to be felt from the cost cuts that you've done already and could you help us quantify that?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I actually think that the impact of cost cutting in the next six months could be outweighed by the concessions we've made in price. Actually, the balance is so fine, Dan, I don't know which way it's going to go.", "Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.", "So it sounds like basically from here margins would be pretty flatish if activity was flatish?", "Andrew F. Gould", "That's what we're hoping for. But, as I say, it's very difficult across the spread of Schlumberger, particularly in the Eastern Hemisphere, to judge whether or not the pricing concessions we've made are going to outweigh the cost cutting that we're doing, and today I would be a little bit pessimistic on that.

Are there any other big lumps of money we need to spend next year?", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, I think that you will see CapEx increase fairly substantially next year, if only because the number of deepwater rigs coming on is higher next year than it is this year. Actually, we have made pension contributions this year of around about $1 billion; I don't think we'll be doing that again next year.", "Simon Ayat", "No, it's [inaudible].

Gould", "I think so, yes.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Andrew, I'll give you kind of an open-ended question and let you kind of run with it. Over the past year I think a lot of us were trying to benchmark the downturn relative to prior cycle periods, and here we are in the early stages of stabilization. I wonder if you can give us your perspective on how you would benchmark recovery, maybe in the context of coming off the lows of '99 or 2001, and if you can kind of give us some breakdown between how you think it might play out internationally in that context as well as in North America?", "Andrew F. Gould", "So first I think that everyone needs to understand that the state of the general economy in this downturn is much worse even than it was in '86 and bears no comparison to '99 or 2001. And therefore there is this underlying question that everybody needs to ask themselves about demand. And if you remember, if you look back, the collapse in 1986 was due to a huge collapse in the demand for oil in the years before 1986. ", "So there is this underlying question which is still fundamental to the oil and gas business - what is happening to demand? And, you know, we have seen some encouraging signs, but we're not back into high demand growth and, in fact, if you looked at presentations I've made recently or people are making recently, the assumption on world GDP is absolutely fundamental to where demand is going to go. And if it's 3% or 4% or 5%, the amount of demand for oil, particularly, is going to be substantially different. So that's interesting.", "The second thing is that, unlike 1986, for oil there is an overhang of 6 or 7 million barrels or whatever it is, but it is nothing like the overhang that existed in 1986 and, as you know, the ability of the industry to renew the production base is a lot less flexible than it was in 1986. So in terms of the need to sustain activity, any growth in demand coupled with a relative modest overhang of production will mean that demand will act as an accelerator on investment. So that's why I made all these remarks in my comments about the level of general investment.", "So for oil, there's a fundamental difference in the economy and there's a fundamental difference in the supply situation. ", "Now for gas, I think we're in a new world. I do not know how this world is going to work out. Why are we in a new world? We're in a new world firstly because there's a huge amount of LNG that's coming onstream, and secondly because we have unlocked a new source of domestic gas production in the United States which means that we can turn the taps on gas very fast. ", "And I think that it is significant and it's really interesting to watch how this is going to play out, but the ratio of gas to oil prices has not been so wide for the last 10 years. And this can have all sorts of implications on demand, but it can also have all sorts of implications on investment because don't forget in Europe gas prices are indexed to oil.", "Sorry, that's a very rambling answer, but you asked for it.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "So in the overall context of some of the things you put here, though, it seems like there's been - I don't want to put words in your mouth - but it seems like there's been a pretty significant shift in tone because, thinking of our call in the second quarter, there were some concerns about rig activity actually in the international market declining through parts of 2010. Now, if I understand or interpret your comments correctly, it looks like the international rig count is going to stabilize here some in the fourth quarter, with a potential improvement going out into next year. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Let me repeat what I said to the previous question. ", "I don't think our customers have seen this high an oil price stable for long enough for them to change their investment plans yet.

Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "On the cycle question, again, maybe I misremember here, but I recall you some time ago speculating about the cycles in the industry maybe changing and becoming shorter and sharper. Did I misremember?", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, you're absolutely correct, and I think that's exactly what we may well experience provided demand holds up for oil.", "I think the equation has changed for gas partly because of LNG and partly because of the capacity of the industry to unlock unconventional sources of gas. ", "Geoff B. Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "On the cycle question, should we be prepared for this kind of violent cycles to repeat themselves in your mind?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, it's going to depend on the economy, Geoff. ", "I mean, really, really, the sensitivity of oil demand to 1% of world GDP is huge, so it really depends at what point economic growth accelerates and to what extent it accelerates. ", "And one of the factors that has changed in the last quarter which is, you know, giving us all a bit more confidence is that GDP revisions for 2010 and even 2009 have been consistently upwards since July.

Gould", "I think North American gas activity will recover to a certain extent at some stage, but the sanctioning of large new LNG developments overseas is likely to go a bit slower than maybe we thought a year ago. A lot of them will get done anyway because we're talking 25-year projects, but there may be some hesitation to sanction some of them until there's a clearer view on gas.", "Now if demand for gas evolves as all the forecasting agencies say it will, this surplus gets reabsorbed by about 2013 or 2014.

Number one, are you happy where you are today in terms of your on the ground presence and infrastructure given how you see the business unfolding?

Compared with other international markets, how do you see the sort of erosion in pricing on tenders in Brazil and how do you see it going from here?", "Andrew F. Gould", "I don't think we've noticed any significant difference in the level of competition in Brazil compared to anywhere else. I think the Brazilians are extremely good at procurement, so I'm sure the pressure will continue. But I don't think it's any competitive than any other major offshore market, Jim.

I think they were talking in general that they thought that tenders had become more competitive out there, and I was just wondering what you had observed relative to that.", "Andrew F. Gould", "No, I don't think we've seen any dramatic increase in the level of competitiveness. Brazil's always been extremely competitive and obviously, with the current interest there is in the country, it is. But I don't think it's something exceptional.", "Jim Crandell - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And, Andrew, now that the IntelliServ deal has been completed with National Oilwell, could you give your views on what you think the commercial potential is of that technology and how quickly it will unfold?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think the first commercial potential of it is for it to arrive at the same level of reliability as mud pulse telemetry, which it's almost there but not quite. And the second is going to be much longer term - it's the capacity to develop new measurements in string, particularly for drilling optimization. That will profit from the fact that you have not simply an uplink that's very fast but perhaps even more important a downlink that's very fast. Because when we transmit commands today by mud pulse telemetry it takes a long time for them to get to the tool because they have to go all the way down the mud column.

In terms of the prospects for recovery in pricing, we all know if the rig count increases there's really no magic level of the rig count at which you start to having pricing power, but if you're sized today for the market in North America and the rig count begins to increase, activity picks up, and you have to go and hire and begin to incur some expenses in meeting that higher level of demand, is there a potential to get pricing improvement at that point or in your view is it further out until we get to a substantially higher level of activity in North America?", "Andrew F. Gould", "Well, I think it depends very much what type of activity it is. If it's a continuation of what we've seen in the Haynesville, for example, where actually the types of service and the complexity and the intensity is quite high, then I think pricing will react quite fast because there'll be a limited field of players that customers will want to use.

If I can give you one example of a place where there's no infrastructure, Pakistan has a huge amount of shale gas, but there is not the infrastructure in Pakistan to exploit it today. ", "So my view is it will happen, it will be more expensive, and it'll probably take a little bit longer than a lot of people seem to be prognosticating at this point in time.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. ", "Andrew F. Gould", "Can you hold on one second, please? Simon can clarify the equity position in the quarter. Simon?", "Simon Ayat", "This is a question from Bill Herbert earlier on. The net equity did improve quarter to quarter. It is really across the board from the different affiliated company investments that we have, but notably the Arabian Drilling Company, which is a drilling joint venture we have in Saudi Arabia. I just wanted to clarify it.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Okay, Kent.", "Operator", "", "Thank you very much.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald; please go ahead, sir.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2010 results conference call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. ", "Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your questions. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures.", "A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat ", "Thank you Malcolm, ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Excluding charges first quarter income was $0.62 per share. This is down $0.05 sequentially and down $0.16 compared to the same quarter of last year. ", "During the quarter we recorded $75 million or $0.06 of charges, $40 million related to the reduction of future tax deductions relating to our retiree medical plan as a result of the passage during the quarter of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the US.", "We also recorded $35 million of merger related transaction costs pertaining to the Smith and Geoservices transactions. We anticipate that we will continue to incur merger and integration related costs. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter when the Smith transaction closes, and the quarters immediately following the merger.", "We will continue to separately identify these charges for you. Turning to the business segments, oilfield services first quarter revenue decreased 1% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue decreased 14%. The sequential decline in both revenue and earnings per share can be primarily attributed to severe winter weather that hampered activity particularly in Russia, combined with the absence of the surge in multi client SIS software and other product sales that we experienced in Q4. ", "These declines were partially offset by an improved performance in North America. Oilfield services pre-tax operating income of $969 million decreased 4% compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield services margins slipped by 46 basis points sequentially to 19% as improvement in North America were offset by a decline in Europe/CIS/Africa. Although all international margins in OFS were 22.3%.", "By area oilfield services sequential pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows. North America improved by 594 basis points to 8% primarily due to an increase in activity across the area supplemented by some pricing improvements for well stimulation services. Latin America increased by 174 basis points to 17.5% mostly as a result of the more favorable revenue mix in Mexico/Central America and the effect of the currency devaluation in Venezuela.", "Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 18.1%, 353 basis points lower principally due to lower activity in Russia and the North Sea and lower testing services, equipment and SIS software sales. Finally, Middle East/Asia margin declined slightly by 156 basis points to 31% primarily due to less favorable revenue mix in the Arabian, Gulf, Qatar and Indonesia GeoMarkets and the absence of the year end artificial lift product and SIS software sales in Q4.", "At WesternGeco pre-tax was $67 million reflected the decrease in pre-tax margin of 659 basis points to 14.3%. This decrease was largely attributable to the absence of the strong year-end multi client sales that we experienced last quarter. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole the effective tax rate excluding charges was 18.9%.", "This was higher than last quarter primarily due to less favorable geographic earning mix in oilfield services. As you are aware the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earnings mix and as such we do experience some volatility on a quarterly basis. ", "Net debt was $75 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $126 million at the end of Q4. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investment on hand and short-term debt of only $934 million. ", "Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $337 million of stock repurchases and $444 million of CapEx. During the quarter we repurchased 5.3 million shares at an average price of $63.72. Subsequent to the announcement of the merger with Smith in February we repurchased the maximum number of shares we could under the SEC\u2019s Safe Harbor provisions. During the second quarter we are projecting a significant increase in our net debt as a result of the closing of the Geoservices transaction combined with the ramp up in CapEx.", "These increases would be offset in part by the expected conversion to equity of our $299 million of convertible debentures during Q2. Oilfield services CapEx is now expected to reach approximately $2.8 billion in 2010 while WesternGeco CapEx is still expected to approach $300 million. ", "And now I\u2019ll turn the conference over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould ", "Thank you Simon and good morning everybody. Schlumberger first quarter revenues of $5.1 billion registered a marginal sequential decline with a strong performance in North America and continued strength in the Middle East/Asia offset an overall decline in product and software sales in the high levels of the fourth quarter and a sharp drop in the North Sea and Russia resulting from lower drilling efficiency and adverse weather conditions. ", "WesternGeco registered an expected sequential decline in multi client revenue while marine activity improved slightly with higher vessel utilization. Looking at the areas in more detail, in North America all GeoMarkets saw revenue growth sequentially. US land grew on increased drilling activity coupled with some pricing improvements that benefited well services technology. ", "Canada experienced significant growth as a result of the strong winter drilling season particularly for the oil basins in the West. This led to higher demand for well services, wireline and drilling and measurement services. The US Gulf of Mexico revenue was higher sequentially on increased shelf and deepwater activity that resulted in strong demand for drilling and measurements, testing services and wireline technologies. ", "Alaska revenue grew from seasonally high exploration activity. In Latin America/Mexico/Central America GeoMarket revenue decreased sequentially primarily due to weather related slowdowns that effected offshore activity and to delays in the finalization of contracts for SIS and data consulting services activities. ", "In Venezuela/Trinidad/Tobago revenue fell from the impact of the devaluation of the Venezuela currency and from the absence of deferred revenue recognized in the prior quarter. But these effects were partially offset by increased demand for SIS software. Revenue in the Brazil and the Peru/Columbia/Ecuador GeoMarkets decreased sequentially mostly due to lower completions and SIS sales partially offset by an increase in IPM activity. ", "Argentina/Bolivia/Chili GeoMarket revenue decreased primarily due to lower SIS software sales. Revenue in the Europe/CIS/Africa area fell sequentially as a result of a combination of lower sales of testing services, equipment, and SIS software with the effect of lower pricing and the weakening of local currencies against the US dollar. ", "Among the GeoMarkets revenue in the North Sea decreased resulting from a combination of lower drilling activity that impacted drilling and measurements, delays in project start-ups that effected testing services, and lower well services stimulation activities. ", "Russia revenue was lower mainly due to the severe winter weather while revenue in the Libya GeoMarket fell on early completion of offshore exploration campaigns. In the Middle East/Asia revenue was essentially flat with the previous quarter as growth in the Australia/Papua New Guinea and East Mediterranean GeoMarkets was offset by lower sales of artificial lift products and SIS software following the surge in the fourth quarter and by lower activity in the Arabian, Gulf, Qatar, and Indonesia GeoMarkets. ", "We gained a number of significant contract wins during the quarter, in Iraq BP awarded us together with our joint venture drilling partner the Iraq Drilling Company, a number of wells on an integrated services basis. In Angola we were awarded a series of six-year contracts for wireline logging, tubing-conveyed perforating, well testing, well completions, coiled-tubing services, and well stimulation vessels. ", "And in marine seismic, WesternGeco was awarded a number of acquisition service on the Norwegian Continental shelf as well as a contract in Brazil for the region\u2019s first multi azimuth survey. We also announced two significant events during the quarter, the proposed merger with Smith International, and the planned acquisition of Geoservices which closed in about an hour after the time our press release went over the wire this morning. ", "In the proposed merger with Smith our complimentary products and services will lead to the development of an engineered drilling system that optimizes all the components of the drill string to allow customers to drill more economically in demanding conditions. What we consider to be a step change in drilling performance and well productivity will come from combining measurement and steering capabilities with the engineering and design of complete bottom-hole assemblies and their various components, including the drilling fluid and the drill bits.", "The addition of Geoservices mud-logging technology to the Schlumberger portfolio will also be an important step in the development of higher-performance drilling systems. The combination of Schlumberger\u2019s real time downhole measurements with Geoservices\u2019 drilling mud analysis will help customers better identify and react to drilling hazards while the combination of mud-logging with Schlumberger formation evaluation measurement will bring a more complete understanding of rock lithology and fluid content. ", "In addition to Geoservices mud-logging technology and expertise, Geoservices\u2019 footprint, expertise and technology in slickline well intervention and field production surveillance will complement existing Schlumberger activities. I look forward to welcoming both the employees of Smith and Geoservices to Schlumberger.", "Our outlook for the remainder of 2010 confirms the optimism we expressed at the beginning of the year. At WesternGeco while the second quarter will see increased vessel transits, strong tendering activity in marine is leading to much improved visibility on the remainder of 2010 and utilization will be higher than originally planned. ", "However new capacity entering the market is likely to limit pricing gains until later in the year. In North America commitment drilling to hold leases as well interest in domestic oil plays should sustain current activity levels in the United States through the second quarter while Canada will experience the normal spring break-up. Beyond that, the picture is less clear as natural gas prices and the fundamentals of the natural gas remain uncertain.", "Higher oil prices are leading to tangible evidence that operators are contemplating higher levels of activity than originally planned in international markets. We reiterate our comment from the last quarter that we see improvements in some offshore markets notably the UK sector of the North Sea, Latin America, and West Africa as well as on land in Russia. ", "In order to prepare for this increase in the latter half of 2010 and in 2011 we have increased our CapEx guidance by $400 million, the bulk of which will be aimed at drilling and measurements and high-end wireline technologies. ", "Finally, I am on record as saying that I felt international margins would bottom at the end of the Q2 2010. I am pleased to report I was mistaken. International margins appear to have bottomed and are now likely to resume a positive trend from now on, absent any exceptional circumstances.", "Thank you very much and I will now hand the call back over for your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt ", "Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt ", "You earlier in the year you did express optimism but then you sort of dialed the numbers back a little bit for 2010 indicating that maybe the street had got a little bit too optimistic, do we interpret sort of your uptick in outlook to mean that 2010 numbers may now have some upside room and can you talk a little bit about exactly what you\u2019re seeing that gives you the increased confidence over the past month or two.", "Andrew Gould ", "Well firstly I feel pretty comfortable with the sort of overall consensus where it is now. And secondly we are seeing clear signs of increases in activity in the North Sea. You can count them. And similarly we\u2019re seeing the results of some of the exploration campaigns in Latin America which are leading to very high quality revenue for us, particularly in wireline and testing. ", "And similarly I\u2019ve always thought that some of the title rigs lots in West Africa would get picked up if the oil price was higher than people were planning and that\u2019s exactly what seems to be happening. So its just, its confirmation that\u2019s come through in the last three months at what I was alluding to in January. ", "Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt ", "So you\u2019re seeing some concrete examples it sounds like. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Yes.", "Dan Pickering - Tudor, Pickering, Holt ", "I know that you\u2019re transitioning your role a little bit at Schlumberger and the company has done I guess about $10 [billion] in acquisitions here in the first quarter, one closed one yet to close, do you think the acquisition side slows down a little bit or does the focus change in terms of the things you look at, can you maybe walk us through what you\u2019re going to be working on in the next year or two.", "Andrew Gould ", "So firstly apart from niche technologies or opportunities we can\u2019t say no to, yes we have shut down or if you like severely restrained the acquisition pipeline and Paal Kibsgaard will be running the day to day operations as COO and I will be taking care of the integration of Geoservices and Smith as well as obviously helping Paal when he needs help. ", "So that\u2019s basically how we\u2019re splitting the roles for the next couple of years. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank ", "", "Mike Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank ", "Wanted to talk about Russia a little bit obviously some weather issues there, but it seems to me there\u2019s been a bit of a disconnect in the market, a lot of the stuff especially in the mature basins spending down a lot there hasn\u2019t recovered much but yet we\u2019re still seeing a lot of the forecasts out there for production growth, I was wondering if you could reconcile those two things and what you see in terms of activity levels and is there a need to ramp up there significantly going forward. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Well I think that last year they were able to sustain and increase their production largely because they got a lot of help from [Vancor] and one other field I can\u2019t remember the name of, but this year if they want to maintain their production at current levels they\u2019re going to have to go back to work in Western Siberia and tendering activity would indicate to us that they do have the intention to do that. ", "And as well for us we will have an even stronger year in Sacalin then we did last year but the big shift from last year is that we think that there\u2019ll be a lot more drilling in Western Siberia in order to sustain their production.", "Mike Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank ", "And then shifting to Iraq, as you noted some nice contract awards there and there\u2019s again some conflicting trends there, there\u2019s a need to ramp up quickly in a number of cases but also still some uncertainty there surrounding the status of the government and so just wanted your thoughts on what the trajectory looks like there, do you expect additional awards or are we just going to be executing on what\u2019s already out there. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Do you mean for the oil companies.", "Mike Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank ", "For the oil companies and then what that means from a service standpoint.", "Andrew Gould ", "I think that its highly unlikely that there is any more licensing rounds or contract rounds for the oil companies. I think that the future is more likely now to be with the Iraqi national oil companies. I don\u2019t think that the oil companies will hesitate to spend on the first phase of the activity in Iraq just because at this point in time there is no stable government. ", "I do think that two or three years down the road if they don\u2019t have a satisfactory judicial physical and political atmosphere, they will hesitate before they go into the very large spending that will be required for the new development. But actually they\u2019re spending for the rehabilitation of the existing fields in terms of a budgets of the size of companies we\u2019re looking at is not huge.", "So I think that activity will as sort of, as has been advertised will go ahead. ", "Mike Urban \u2013 Deutsche Bank ", "So any delta from here would be from the NOC there.", "Andrew Gould ", "Yes.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Wanted to just come back to the macro team again here and maybe flesh it out maybe a little bit more and obviously your reference in Dan\u2019s question some tangible evidence that you\u2019re now seeing that gives you the confidence now, you increased your CapEx which I think pretty much underscores your conviction that the market cycle is starting to turn, and probably turn in Schlumberger\u2019s favor, I was wondering if you might give us some insights as to how you see the cycle evolving and how it will in your view accelerate in the international markets and if you can give us some benchmarks and comparisons to prior cycle periods. Is it going to be a faster acceleration in line maybe a little bit slower, if you could give us any color that would be great.", "Andrew Gould ", "", "I think there is a bit of a difference between this cycle and the 2004 and 2008 cycle, in 2004 2008 we had a huge amount of natural gas projects going on overseas that were not going to be going on this time around. So we had the whole Qatar LNG ramp up, we had Yemen, we had other stuff in Africa and while there will be some of that this time around, I don\u2019t think its going to be anything like the volume of what we had between 2004 and 2008.", "So this cycle is going to be far more in my opinion related to oil outside the United States, even inside the United States. And there I think that if you look at the latest demand figures for the non-OECD world, you look at the flattening of the demand drop in the OECD world and you look at the potential call on OPEC I don\u2019t see any reason for the price of oil to decline very far from where it is today in which case gradually confidence is going to grow to bring in a lot more of these particularly offshore projects that we all know that our customers have lined up.", "And on land its going to increase all the activity and production enhancements so I think absent a double-dip in the developing world or a huge double-dip in the OECD that the oil cycle is probably going to, I hate to say this again, but its going to be stronger for longer. But the gas cycle is going to be very much effected by the amount of LNG that\u2019s just been put on stream and of course by the advent of shale gas, so unconventional gas in the United States.", "Now in terms of our CapEx what is very satisfactory is these deepwater rigs are starting up on time. We had more, the start ups we anticipated in Q1 have gone on time and pretty flawlessly which means that we\u2019re getting more deepwater activity earlier than we thought and if that carries through that means we had to accelerate the CapEx. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Now in connection with that and how the cycle may be evolving and Schlumberger\u2019s position there seems to a line of thought in the marketplace that Schlumberger is losing share in certain geographic markets and some product lines and I understand this Angola project that you referenced in your press release today I think there\u2019s some element of significance that may be worth mentioning, so I was wondering if you could just talk about your view of Schlumberger\u2019s market share position both from a geographic market and from the technology standpoint and would you generally agree with the view out there that Schlumberger is at risk from the competition. ", "Andrew Gould ", "So let me deal with Angola first, the whole Angola thing that\u2019s been announced by us and others is a renewal. It is not new work. It is a major, major renewal. And in that renewal we have renewed segments we already had working there and we have added segments that were not working there before.", "In terms, I don\u2019t, its very difficult to believe your own people and market share data, but we constantly look for where we\u2019ve lost market share and we constantly fail to find it. I can only think of one major piece of market share we\u2019ve lost in the last two years. And then I go to the [Spears] data and the Spears data if you look at if Q409 over Q408 says we\u2019ve increased our market share more than our principal competitors so I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t see it. ", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "And just basic question now, one area that you think you lost share where would that be. ", "Andrew Gould ", "It was one big contract and I\u2019m not going to rub my poor people\u2019s nose in it. It was one big contract we lost. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Welcome back into the camp of more bullish people again, its good to have you back. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Well its nice to be back, but prudent has always been my watch word in these things. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Absolutely and I hope you of course stick with that, on the jack up side we\u2019re seeing big tender activity in the North Sea and West Africa Middle East of the broad base, of course that the [inaudible] you\u2019re talking to, but we\u2019re not really seeing much in the deepwater market in terms of a kick off of increased tender and contract, so can you give us a little bit of a view on how you see the exploration side turn more into a development drilling kind of kick off both in West Africa and then selected deepwater markets in Asia. Can you give us a little color on what you\u2019re seeing now compared to\u2014", "Andrew Gould ", "Well I think, so firstly the deepwater programs that have been announced and rigs have been contracted for happening as I mentioned earlier they seem to be happening on time which is unusual. Secondly I think that the operators generally will make sure that deepwater rig rates come down a bit and once they\u2019ve done that they will do some exploration. ", "They hate paying top dollar for exploration rigs so in fact I think an adjustment down similar to what we\u2019ve seen recently in the big deepwater rigs or even the sort of the second or third generation rigs that can do an exploration well in deepwater is very positive for us. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Are you saying that this is not coming over the past couple of, has there been any kind of rate or change in your customer inquiry levels as of late.", "Andrew Gould ", "Only really in West Africa whereas I said earlier there were some semis that had idle slots and those idle slots are getting filled with an exploration well here or there. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "On exploration again on the seismic market you mentioned that you saw firmer [inaudible] into the back end of the year, could you elaborate a little bit, is this you realizing higher prices, is it leading edge, are you expecting to bid a higher, firmer prices.", "Andrew Gould ", "I think the answer is that we, our utilization for 2010 is pretty much wrapped up and therefore we\u2019re expecting to bid higher. Whether we\u2019ll be successful or not is another question. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "On the pricing on renewals if you could repice your international work, let\u2019s say for example you highlighted this Angola contract, this rolling over and renewing, could you give us a little bit of a feel for how a rollover pricing has changed compared to let\u2019s say three months ago, are we back into positive territory again or \u2013", "Andrew Gould ", "No I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any change in large tenders, in large tenders in international pricing in the last three months. I\u2019m not exactly sure when this is bid but with the evaluation process and the award process, it was probably bid early last year. ", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Would you expect at this point to be bidding higher prices and prices rolling off or are you still in negative territory if you\u2019re looking forward from here. ", "Andrew Gould ", "If we look forward from here I think for specific high end technology we will be looking to push price. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company ", "Along those lines here I was curious as to whether you could provide us with a road map if you will for international margins, do you, you said that they\u2019ve troughed in Q1 but really what I\u2019m looking for is how you see them evolving second half of 2010 and next year and really talking about the interplay between volume, mix and price, and what I\u2019m trying to reference here is back in 2006 and 2007 we were generating 40% incremental margins and how long do you think before we get back to that and what will it take to get back to that. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Well firstly I think that for the balance of this year there are two elements of price that will dominate and they are firstly volume and mix. Volume is better utilization of equipment and mix is the big shift towards deepwater and offshore that\u2019s taking place at the moment. I think that the other thing that will happen in this year, but this depends very much on us, is the $80.00 oil.", "Our customers will loosen their purse strings on using the high end technology that in the downturn the engineers were told they were not allowed to buy or they should go easy on because it was expensive in the worst of it. So we, if you like, it\u2019s the difference between a cheap bottle of wine and feeling you can afford a good bottle of wine. ", "So we think we\u2019ll see a little bit of that, not a lot. I don\u2019t think we will get real pricing traction until we start to have volume issues, in other words that people start to move into equipment shortages and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that that could happen this year. I think next year in certain segments particularly drilling and measurements, if the level of drilling stays where it is you will start to see operators wanting to tie up equipment and therefore that gives you some demand pull pricing power. ", "But I don\u2019t think its this year, I think its next year. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company ", "Do you think its unreasonable to expect us getting back to those really flush incremental margins sometime next year. ", "Andrew Gould ", "There has to be demand there, so it really, really does depend on the level of activity and I can\u2019t see that yet. Because we really, really get pricing power when our customers are desperate to have the equipment. So in fact in the 2005 cycle one of the things that provoked that was the huge sucking of equipment into Saudi Arabia, that frightened operators elsewhere so if Iraq went very, very fast, which personally I don\u2019t believe, that also could suck in fairly large amounts of equipment. ", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company ", "So you don\u2019t see it yet for 2010 yet you\u2019re not necessarily ruling it out for next year. ", "Andrew Gould ", "I\u2019m not ruling it out but I\u2019m not going to call it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan ", "David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Question on WesternGeco I don\u2019t think a choppy recovery will surprise anyone and taking into account your remarks on pricing, I was wondering if you could compare for me how this business is positioned now to where it was in 2002, 2003. It seems to me that with multi client de-emphasized it should be a much quicker uptick in margins, and with your limited capital requirements going forward that maybe you should be hitting mid cycle returns at a much earlier stage then the past cycle. Am I right on that. ", "Andrew Gould ", "The only reason I\u2019m, so firstly I think on multi client you\u2019re right, in other words that the, our library is extremely healthy and that to the extent that activity remains robust particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa then library sales will probably go faster then they did in the last cycle and a lot of that will be to do with technology. ", "Because we have made major strides, the industry and us, have made major strides in the quality of multi client over the last four or five years. But in marine there is going to be, there is something like 14 or 15 treaty boats that are either new or can come back into the market fairly shortly so that\u2019s what\u2019s going to, if you like, slow pricing uptick in marine seismic, whereas last time around the boats were not in a build cycle and therefore the excess capacity got sucked up faster. ", "You\u2019re quite right to point out that the Eastern [Ecco] deal means that we will not be in the market for building or huge CapEx commitments for our marine fleet in the next few years. ", "David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan ", "On just a different subject, on your last call it sounded like you were focusing a little bit more on the emerging shales in North America but more recently EMP has been taking up a lot of headlines a lot of talk about a shift into unconventional oil, just wondering if this changes your thinking at all in this market, should we be looking for Schlumberger to perhaps be more aggressive going after this business and kind of what\u2019s your sense of service intensity of the oil versus the gas plays. ", "Andrew Gould ", "I think my competitors have commented that they\u2019re very similar and I think they\u2019re right. I do think and I\u2019m not, please don\u2019t ask me why because I\u2019m not going to say, we do have certain technologies that in these unconsolidated oil plays are quite advantageous. And obviously we will be introducing those probably later this year. ", "Its adaptation of other technology that we have but its, and its not hydraulic fracturing. But we think that we probably have some tools that can make a difference. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS ", "Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS ", "To dig another cut at the international margins you pieced in 2007, 2008 about 28 to 30% margins, today at 22%, you think that we will return to those peak margins, or potentially go beyond and is that a 2013 event or could it actually be earlier and finally do you think that  the increase in IPM risk, there\u2019s margins and returning to those levels. ", "Andrew Gould ", "So firstly I think that the comment I would make which is if you like an indication of the relative mildness of the cycle overseas is that for our margins to only go from 28 to 22 instead of in the teens, probably in the mid teens, is a pretty remarkable situation. But how fast it can go back really, really does depend on how fast activity accelerates and that\u2019s still a judgment I\u2019m afraid on the general economy. ", "There is no doubt that oil drilling is going to be very solid but how fast its going to go is going to depend very much on the general economy. So can we get back there one day, yes I\u2019m actually convinced we can, but please don\u2019t ask me to say its 2013 or 2014, I don\u2019t know. ", "Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS ", "I guess to follow along that as far as talking specifically about Iraq do you think that, how much time do you think it will pass before you get to margins that you\u2019re happy with there and do you need a scale as far as the number of rigs operating in the region to reach those margins and do you have any concerns so far on how your competition is bidding in the region. ", "", "Andrew Gould ", "I don\u2019t think the first phase in Iraq, in other words the rehabilitation of the existing fields and the just the drilling of wells in non locations is necessarily going to produce for anybody the sort of margins that they like. And also we\u2019re all going to have set up costs, we\u2019re all going to have, it will be pass through but it nonetheless will effect the margins you see, security costs for example. ", "And have I seen any irrational bidding behavior, so far no I haven\u2019t actually. Not of the, we don\u2019t really obviously know what other people bid but given the pricing we\u2019ve been using, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen totally irrational behavior so far. ", "Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS ", "Do you think its scale or time that pushes you\u2014", "Andrew Gould ", "Scale in Iraq is a difficult thing, I think its going to go project by project. For example you do not want to build out infrastructure in advance of work because every time you build a new piece of infrastructure it adds to your security risk and your security costs. Every time you have a new base, you have to have more security and it costs you more. So I think people will build out, certainly we will build out project by project. ", "Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS ", "And then finally going along with the scale side, do you want to give us your thoughts on Mexico, the labs, the incentive contracts and do you think that over time we could go back to the recent highs as far as activity levels that we saw in 2009 or will that take some time or just lack of clarity so far. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Everyone, our lab is started like everybody else\u2019s, we in fact have had a group in Mexico City studying this problem for the last two years so we\u2019re not, we have some ideas and actually I think that it will be quite a long time, at least a couple of years, before Pamex is in a position to judge whether or not the production potential justifies the scale of drilling program that they previously had. ", "So I think it will be a couple of years before we know that and in the meantime yes they will drill but I don\u2019t think they will drill on anything like the scale they were drilling before. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "First question is we haven\u2019t really talked too much about North America, you\u2019re more bullish on international and that seems very logical, less visibility in North America because of the gas situation but could you talk maybe to the profitability levels in this market, the rig count say flattens, can North America reach a reasonable profitability level for Schlumberger. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Well yes, I think at this level of rigs, when we\u2019ve completed the various initiatives we have on the way to improve our utilization and improve our decision making, I think that we can reach a level of profitability that will satisfy us, yes. But we\u2019re already a little way into that process so far therefore the improvement we got in Q1 was a good job on the part of the people who were involved. ", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "Is part of the GeoMarket reassessment in cost initiative that you\u2019ve talked about last time that is getting you there.", "Andrew Gould ", "Its not really a cost initiative its more a question of management control over the levers which we had to decentralize and which we\u2019re busy centralizing in different basins. ", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets", "On international you noted Saudi as a sort of driver or catalyst in the last cycle, two parts here, is Saudi market going to be less important in this coming cycle and maybe is there another market like Saudi that\u2019s going to be that kind of I guess driver of profitability or the one that really makes everything move this cycle. ", "Andrew Gould ", "I don\u2019t think that anyone else in the world is going to build on a scale, build out on a scale that Saudi builds out between 2005 and 2009. Saudi will remain a very, very important market not just for oil but also because they have very ambitious plans in gas and very ambitious plans in exploration. ", "I don\u2019t see another market that is capable of ramping up as fast as Saudi did. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "Just a couple of clean up questions, on the international margins you said that the first quarter is the bottom would that statement apply individually to the three regions. ", "Andrew Gould ", "No I think I\u2019m going to say it applies globally, because you can always have a mix effect that will uptick or down tick a particular region in a particular quarter. ", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "With that in mind, do you think that those down ticks could drive the margins in any one of the regions below what they were in the first quarter. ", "", "Andrew Gould ", "It doesn\u2019t look that way. We\u2019re not talking about North America right. ", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "No international. And on North America in regards to these management initiatives where would you say you are in the implementation, it sounds like your review is finished and you\u2019re in the implementation stage, is that correct. ", "Andrew Gould ", "I would say that we\u2019re more than a third but less than half way into the implementation. ", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "And I don\u2019t know if you can answer this but in a steady state activity environment what kind of margin improvement are you targeting with these initiatives. ", "Andrew Gould ", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to discuss that. ", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co.", "And in regards to your earlier comments about Mexico not getting back to the level of drilling activity, that was specific to Chicontepec. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Yes. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi", "Just to finish that question we can look back and see that over the last years that Schlumberger\u2019s margins in North America have been almost exactly comparable to its peers, and for the fourth quarter and the first quarter clearly was below so it sounds like you believe that with the initiatives you\u2019re taking you will be back very much in line with the other multi service companies in North America. ", "Andrew Gould ", "So I would be very disappointed if our people in North America didn\u2019t have at least that ambition. The only thing I would say is that with one of our competitors we have a comparable mix, with the other one we don\u2019t yet but they will shortly. So the mix effect can effect what the overall margin is for each company. And when we finished, closed the Smith transaction and when Baker closed the BJ transaction we have to relook at the whole margin landscape. ", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi", "Then just on the deepwater market where you had I guess a favorable comment about the timing of the deepwater rig start ups, so if we think about all of the rigs that are under construction today and the timing that we can see that they\u2019re scheduled for delivery certainly looks like 2012 would be the first really full year and what is the order of magnitude of that increase in deepwater drilling 2010 versus 2011, the bulk of the rigs really seem to be mostly coming in 2011. ", "Andrew Gould ", "It means that, I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me but certainly 2010 is much bigger than 2009 and then again 2011 is much bigger than 2010. And actually 2012 I haven\u2019t even looked at. Because you know when a rig comes into the market if you take the number of rigs that people announce are coming into the market in any one year you basically have to divide it in two because the average would arrive half way through the year.", "So this year we get the full effect of the rigs that came into the market in 2009 and half the effect of 2010 and next year we get the cumulative 2009 and 2010 and half of 2011. So you\u2019re probably quite right that 2012 will be the high point of deepwater activity. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of William Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil ", "William Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil ", "I was curious as it relates again to Latin America and the margin performance being surprisingly good, unlike your peers you didn\u2019t identify specifically the Venezuela devaluation as a non-recurring item, just curious as to what kind of impact that had negatively to the quarter and what kind of add back could we have expected there and the results in Latin America.", "Andrew Gould ", "I\u2019m going to let Simon discuss the Venezuela valuation and if you want more granularity on the rest of it I\u2019ll talk about it afterwards. ", "Simon Ayat ", "Let me take this in two parts, first why we didn\u2019t see any impact on the devaluation, we obviously have an impact on the devaluation, the reason it was not apparent because in Venezuela we do take a very prudent approach within the rules of accounting, we anticipated this kind of devaluation and we have deferred certain gains from exchange that we experienced during 2009 to be ready for this eventuality.", "And it did take place and we covered it from within the balance sheet. Now as far as the impact on the business obviously the revenue drops because we have a Bol\u00edvar portion of our revenue but on the cost side it has a positive impact because the cost reduced given the new rates and as a result was slightly positive impact on the margin overall in Venezuela.", "So this is basically the story. ", "Andrew Gould ", "And I would say the other element that helped us is that a lot of the adjustment of our cost based in Mexico took place in 2009 as well. ", "William Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil ", "And that\u2019s been a big difference for you, you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re carrying additional cost that some may be doing as they await what happens in Mexico in terms of spending. ", "Andrew Gould ", "We don\u2019t own rigs very many of them anyway. ", "William Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil ", "My follow-up would be you mentioned limits on the first quarter share repurchases here or Safe Harbor I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any limits that we should think about share repurchases either in the second quarter or until the Smith acquisition is closed. ", "Simon Ayat ", "There are certain rules that we have to follow, we continue to buy now under the Safe Harbor rule and as soon as the proxies are mailed to the shareholders of Smith there is a blackout period that we have to respect until the shareholders vote on the transaction, then we\u2019ll be free to buy without limits except the normal limit for buybacks. ", "So there is a period of time, we hope it will not be too long between the mailing of the proxy to the shareholders and the voting on the transaction. ", "William Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil ", "And we should probably still expect that you\u2019re buying back enough stock to offset any dilution as a whole for the company is that fair.", "Andrew Gould ", "Dilution from the employee programs, yes. The Smith transaction it won\u2019t really be, we can\u2019t really look at that until as Simon says, the Smith shareholders have voted. ", "Simon Ayat ", "But the rate we are buying at its bigger than the dilution from the stock based compensation program. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast", "Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast", "I note as Bill did the performance in Latin America is very good on the margin side in particular and so with that my question is actually around Europe/Africa margins which might have been a little bit lower although we were, you alerted us to the weather impacts, what\u2019s the progression from here with the recovery of some of those transitory issues on weather in the North Sea, weather in Russia, and you\u2019ve mentioned some specific contract awards in Russia but when do we get back to sort of 2Q, 3Q 2009 margins in that region. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Q3 2009, how much as that Simon, do you have that in front of you Pierre.", "", "Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast", "In the low to mid 20\u2019s.", "Andrew Gould ", "I think we\u2019ll get back to the low 20\u2019s fairly quickly because the trouble with Russian weather is that not only do you have your equipment doing nothing but you also have to pay to heat it. So the cost effect of minus 35 temperature days is huge. So aside the activity just the equipment working normally makes a huge difference to the margin. ", "Pierre Conner - Capital One Southcoast", "So there\u2019s a big piece and then the North Sea as well some recovery there\u2014", "Andrew Gould ", "The North Sea efficiency will improve in the second quarter and in fact our stimulation boat was dry docked for 18 days as well in Q1. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs", "I wanted to follow-up on North America and sort of the reshuffling process that you have going on there, you\u2019ve actually grown in line with peers sequentially but your incremental margins are in line with peers as well but I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re carrying some extra costs associated with this and I know you don\u2019t like to break that out, but are we talking about incremental or additional costs in the $20 to $30 million range that at some point through the year will fade.", "Andrew Gould ", "No I don\u2019t think you should think of it as incremental cost, I think there is still cost we have in North America that we need to eliminate. So its idle facilities, things like that and you know that all takes place over the balance of the year so there is incremental costs associated with the reorganization or the restructuring or whatever you want to call it, but it really is fairly marginal. It\u2019s a group of people. ", "So I wouldn\u2019t take it as something that\u2019s just going to disappear but that group of people is working at getting the whole cost base down. ", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs", "So we should measure the success of this risk shuffling as higher incremental margins to allow you to catch up to peers over the course of the next four quarters. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Yes. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "A couple of unrelated questions, just a follow-up on the North American market in the assessment you\u2019ve made to date are there changes to your capital commitment that you expect in North America. ", "Andrew Gould ", "One of the effects of what we\u2019re doing should be much higher equipment utilization. And therefore the revenue dollar per hydraulic horsepower or whatever you want to use as a measure should increase and therefore ultimately the amount of CapEx that we\u2019ll need to cover what we do compared to Schlumberger did in the past will probably go down. ", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "So the additional $400 million it does not sound like is being directed\u2014", "Andrew Gould ", "No I was very clear, the additional $400 million is drilling and measurement and high end wireline, its not pressure pumping. ", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "And then can you tell us how much of your percentage of revenues is coming from deepwater today and maybe how you expect that to evolve over the next couple of years then given all we\u2019ve talked about with deepwater.", "Andrew Gould ", "", "We haven\u2019t disclosed that. I don\u2019t think we want to at this point in time but it\u2019s a substantial portion and it obviously has a very high growth factor. ", "Brad Handler - Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s why I figured I\u2019d probe, how about if I ask it a little more generally just in terms of offshore, as a percentage, offshore revenues as a percentage of total. ", "Andrew Gould ", "Its not 50% but it\u2019s a, I would say its somewhere between 30 and 40. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Wagar Syed \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "Wagar Syed \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "", "I just wanted to get a sense from you about the outlook for Venezuela and what does the payment schedule look like now. ", "Andrew Gould ", "I would describe the payment schedule as thoroughly under control and a very good understanding between ourselves and [inaudible] service for what is necessary. And the activity actually I think will pick up slightly this year particularly for us given the amount of success they\u2019ve had with gas. So I think Venezuela will finally have a slightly better year this year then they did last year. ", "Wagar Syed \u2013 Macquarie Capital ", "Do you see any recurring expenses from this healthcare bill. ", "Simon Ayat ", "No this is, basically there was a write off of some deferred tax assets so we\u2019re not going to see this as ongoing no, it was one-time.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak ", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak ", "I just wanted to get a clarification on those deepwater comments you made earlier I guess in response to Robin\u2019s question, you said peek in 2012 but I\u2019m assuming you meant based off of the equipment we know is already been ordered and is being built now rather than an actual peek in the market. ", "Andrew Gould ", "A peek on what we know is going to come to the market, yes. Not anything that gets launched now. And it assumes that, there\u2019s a very high utilization rate for deepwater rigs as well. ", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak ", "And one other unrelated, in Russia you\u2019re talking about a little bit more of a swing to Western from Eastern Siberia, would that imply that margins will while they recover nicely will, may not be as high on the individual work since its less, more fields and so a little more competitive and higher\u2014", "Andrew Gould ", "No I think that the, while you\u2019re quite correct to point out that Western Siberia margins are not as high as Eastern Siberia or Sacalin, the sheer volume will compensate for that. ", "Kevin Simpson \u2013 Miller Tabak ", "And you don\u2019t think there\u2019s, some of these expansions of your competitors trying to be like you will limit upside pricing power or limit pricing power.

Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.  Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results.

A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. And now I will turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter income was $0.68 per share. Excluding the charges in prior periods, this is an increase of $0.06 sequentially and flat as compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we began to see the early effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The impact of the moratorium on Oilfield Services resulted in a reduction of Schlumberger's Q2 earnings of approximately $0.02 per share. We anticipate the moratorium earnings impact for the second half of 2010 to be approximately $0.08 to $0.12 per share. ", "Turning to the business segments. Oilfield Services second quarter revenue increased 7% sequentially, while WesternGeco revenue increased 1%. The growth in Oilfield Services revenue was largely attributable to a surge in activity and increased pricing in U.S. Land, the post-winter seasonal rebound in Russia and increased activity in Mexico/Central America and the North Sea. The acquisition of Geoservices during the quarter also added to revenue. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the spring breakup in Canada, the previously mentioned early effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and reduced activity in the North Africa GeoMarket. ", "Oilfield Services pretax operating income of $1.07 billion increased 11% compared to the prior quarter, while pretax operating margin increased 75 basis points to 19.8%. The increase in margin was primarily driven by a strong performance in North America. International margins increased slightly to 22.4%. ", "By area, Oilfield Services sequential pretax operating margin highlights were as follows: In North America, pretax operating margin improved 237 basis points to 10.4%. Within North America, U.S. Land margin improved significantly by 15 percentage points as a result of higher activity and pricing for Well Services technologies. However, this increase was tempered by lower margin in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from the early effects of the deepwater drilling moratorium and reduced margins in the Canada due to spring breakup. ", "Latin America margin increased 35 basis points to 17.9%, primarily due to the increased activity in the Mexico/Central America and Argentina/Bolivia/Chile GeoMarkets. However, as noted in the press release, we anticipate a slowdown of activity in Mexico, and we will subsequently have an associated charge in Q3. Europe/CIS/Africa margin increased 29 basis points to 18.4%, as the positive impact of the seasonal rebound in activity in Russia and a more favorable revenue mix in the North Sea offset the impact of reduced revenue in the Western South Africa and North Africa GeoMarkets. Middle East/Asia margin remains strong at 31.1%. ", "Sequentially, WesternGeco pretax operating income decreased 31% to $47 million, and pretax operating margins slipped 447 basis points to 9.8%, primarily due to a decrease in monthly client sales and lower revenue combined with the startup costs for Land. These decreases were partially offset by improved productivity in Marine.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 17.8%. This was lower than last quarter, primarily due to a more favorable geographic earnings mix in WesternGeco. As you are aware, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earnings mix and as such, we do experience some volatility on a quarterly basis. ", "Net debt was $766 million at the end of the quarter as compared to $75 million at the end of the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of only $719 million. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1 billion relating to the acquisition of Geoservices, $634 million of CapEx, $535 million of stock repurchases and the conversion of $297 million of outstanding debentures into 7.4 million shares of common stock. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.4 million shares at an average price of $63.33. We repurchased the maximum number of shares we could under the SEC Safe Harbor provisions in light of the pending merger with Smith. Oilfield Services CapEx is still expected to reach approximately $2.8 billion for 2010, while WesternGeco CapEx is expected to be approximately $335 million. ", "And now, I turn the conference over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould", "Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody. Schlumberger's second quarter revenue of $5.94 billion or 6% higher sequentially and 7% higher year-on-year. The sequential revenue increases recorded in all Oilfield Service areas, led by strong performances in both North and Latin America. Among the technologies, sequential revenue growth was strongest in Well Services, primarily due to stronger U.S. Land activity in pricing, increased product sales in the Middle East and a seasonal rebound in Russia. ", "In North America, surging activity and improved pricing in the U.S. Land GeoMarket more than offset the combined effects of the Canadian spring breakup and the start of the drilling moratorium in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that began late in the quarter. In Latin America, Mexico grew on higher activity and stronger Integrated Project Management activity, while Brazil continued to see a buildup in offshore exploration activity. ", "In Europe/CIS/Africa, the effects of a strong post-winter rebound in Russia and improve activity in the North Sea drove revenue growth, although these effects were partially offset by lower activity in North Africa and lower exploration services in West Africa. In Middle East/Asia, most GeoMarkets saw higher activity with strong demand for Wireline Services boosted by higher sales of Well Services product and Artificial Lift equipment. ", "In the Middle East, Integrated Project Management services diversified further, as our presence increased in Iraq and preparations began to pud the first well in the Rumaila field with the first of the three rigs planned. The second and third rigs will follow, we see continuing increases in Iraq activity throughout the rest of the year. ", "The WesternGeco revenue is sequentially flat with strong increases in Marine and data processing were insufficient to overcome the effect of reduced multi-client activity mainly in North America, following the traditionally strong first quarter sales and in Land, following the completion of a contract in the Middle East. New technologies continue to contribute to the overall performance particularly in Well Services, while a number of new contract awards underpinned future progress.", "In particular, I would mention the award by Petrobras of two new stimulation vessels, would represent the return of Schlumberger to the Brazilian vessel stimulation marketplace after a long absence. In a similar move in Mexico, an award of a vessel from PEMEX will give us a strong presence in the country's offshore stimulation market. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we see a continued slow build of activity in the second half in most parts of the world. ", "U.S. Land, Brazil, the North Sea, Russia and the Middle East and Asia will be areas of continued strength. This will be partially offset by reductions in IPM [Integrated Project Management] activity in Mexico, in both Chicontepec and Burgos. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we are not planning for any resumption of drilling activity this year. In deepwater activity elsewhere, we have not seen nor do we expect to see any significant delays or program reductions as a result of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico drilling moratorium. Internationally, operators, contractors and regulatory bodies have stepped up maintenance and verification of key well control equipment and procedures, but have not restricted actual drilling activity. The outlook for WesternGeco will be governed by the evolution of the multi-client market in the Gulf of Mexico, which remains uncertain at this time.", "At Schlumberger, we began a program three years ago called Excellence in Execution. This program was designed to create a step change in the service quality and efficiency we provide. And in deepwater, we aim at enabling our customers to reduce the risk and cost of their deepwater operations. The program, in addition to equipment and procedure improvements, provides the competency certification of all our personnel involved in deepwater operations. We are encouraged by the results, as well as our customers' acceptance of this multiyear initiative.", "We believe that the contribution of deepwater discoveries has been and will remain very significant to future hydrocarbon production. We therefore welcome the current efforts to better understand and control the risks associated with these types of operations. While additional control and oversight will undoubtedly add costs, we expect this will be offset in the long run by improvements in operating procedures and technology.", "The recovery in world demand for oil had been reasonably robust, and current forecast for the coming year remain consistent with slowly increasing levels of exploration and production activity. Natural gas economics remain more challenging, the supply of both LNG and unconventional gas in the U.S. would appear to continue to outstrip the demand recovery. Overall, therefore, we see the current trend of a slow but sure recovery in activity, as likely to continue without a change until we have a clearer view of the sustainability of the recovery in the world economy.", "Finally, as an update on our proposed merger with Smith International, our view has not changed that the merger will close in the third quarter of this year. The closing remains subject to clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice, clearance by the European Commission, approval by Smith International stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other closing conditions. I would only add that the annual meeting of the Smith International stockholders has been announced for August 24. ", "And I will now turn the call back to Julie.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] With that, we'll go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "My initial question here is given the recent changes and the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico and a lot of the regulation and other types of concerns, does this at all alter your -- it doesn't sound like it, but I'd like to hear it again, does this alter your viewpoint of the deepwater growth prospects? Does it alter your strategy on how you're going to try and attack that market?", "Andrew Gould", "So I think the first thing to say is, in the last three years, somewhere between 40% and 50% of the new field discoveries have been in deepwater. Deepwater production has been scheduled to become 10 million barrels a day by 2015, so that's approaching 10% of world supply. And it's a bigger supply than almost any country apart from three. So I think it's highly unlikely that apart from some delays caused by proper caution and control, that there is any significant reduction in deepwater activity anywhere. And I find it extremely interesting that both Norway and the U.K. have permitted some of the deepest water wells they've ever drilled since the Gulf of Mexico moratorium was put on. So I don't think this is going to significantly slow deepwater in the medium to long term. I do think that the issue of spill response is something the industry has to address, I was pleased to see what the majors put out yesterday. And in terms of ourselves, I feel extremely comfortable because as I pointed out in the press release, we've made a huge effort to understand the risks of what we do in deepwater and to specifically train our people to be aware of those risks and to react to them. So after a brief pause in the Gulf of Mexico, I don't see any reason to change our strategy in deepwater, Kurt.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Along the lines of the Smith, it sounds like things there are clearly progressing very well, maybe even ahead of your initial expectations, so I don't want to put words in your mouth. It doesn't appear to me like the Street is really giving you any credit or paying much attention to what Smith may bring to the overall organization. I was wondering if you share that view and if so, what do you think we're all missing?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I don't know whether the Street understand or appreciate what it will bring to Schlumberger or not. But, I mean, I like to do things sometimes by anecdotal example. So we presented the Smith strategy to our Board of Directors on Tuesday, and they all came out very excited. And on Wednesday morning, I got an e-mail from the manager of one of the countries in the Middle East, where under the current new rig assignments, six rigs have been taken away from our competitors and given to us on the basis that we drill faster, and that was without Smith. So I'm extremely bullish on what Smith is going to do for us, once we start to integrate the different drilling services they have with the drilling services that we have.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets Corporation", "Would you like to offer up what country that was?", "Andrew Gould", "No. I'm afraid I wouldn't, Kurt.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Andrew, you highlight strong performance in North America, and then we look at your margins and compare them with other companies that have reported so far and there's clearly a big gap. And I mean, that's just, of course, due a bit some way on mix. But you seem to put in place in the organization, can you just outline the road map to getting your North American business to kind of close the gap at some way over at your peers?", "Andrew Gould", "I think that perhaps the thing to say is that the improvement in our U.S. Land margins in Q2 was purely through activity and pricing and without any effects of the reorganization, though a lot of the reorganization work was taking place. And therefore, I would remind everybody that we said we would take a restructuring charge associated with North America in Q3, and that is still the intention, but it won't be very large. But the effects of the restructuring will only start to flow through to the margins in the third and fourth quarters. And therefore, we continue to expect to see outside the constraints of activity and pricing improvements in our cost structure and efficiency in North America through the balance of the year.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Historically, or not historically, but you've previously alluded to the fact that there must be smarter way of doing shale and unconventional than brute horsepower. Could you update us to your latest thoughts there, and whether any new technology has any way of playing into your strategy in North America?", "Andrew Gould", "So I think we are much closer, I'm not going to announce what we'll be doing over the sound waves, Ole. But I think we're much closer to understanding the technology set that we think is appropriate to improving our capacity to predict the productivity of shale from measurements. And if we do that, this is not going to happen this year, it's going to take a little time. If we can do that, then eventually, it will start to change the technology set that is used to produce shale. But it's not this year, Ole. But I think, we are much closer to defining what we think that technology set will be.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "So we shouldn't expect you to put as reason, go and massively increase your capacity or horsepower for example?", "Andrew Gould", "No.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Second question would be on Middle East, impressive margins. You're building up in Iraq. Could you -- as Iraq gets going and you get beyond the startup costs, will Iraq be accretive or dilutive or neutral to your Middle East margins?", "Andrew Gould", "It's going to be negative to our Middle East margins overall in 2010, and I think it will balance out in 2011.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Are you already taking substantial startup costs there?", "Andrew Gould", "We're taking startup costs, I wouldn't call them huge. We haven't identified them but they are in the margin in Q2.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell with Barclays Capital.", "James Crandell - Barclays Capital", "Andrew, my first question is about your Seismic business. Can you talk about, first, the outlook for the Multi-Client business over the rest of the year?", "Andrew Gould", "I can only give you the known, unknown, Jim. So the first question is, is the moratorium extended beyond six months? I don't think so, but we don't know yet. We haven't been granted a seismic permit since the moratorium came on to keep the boat working. The big question is going to be whether the March 2011 Eastern Gulf or Central Gulf lease sale takes place or gets postponed, and I could see a very good case for the new BOE [Bureau of Ocean Energy] actually postponing it. There are two next year. The other one being in August. If it's just a postponement, then it will be a postponement of revenue rather than a cancellation. We honestly don't know whether or not the moratorium in the traditional ramp up of Multi-Client sales at the end of the year is going to have a positive or negative effect. If the future of exploration drilling in the Gulf is still very uncertain in November, it's going to have a negative effect. If the rules will become clearer, then maybe some of our customers will be tempted to buy some data with some of the budget they haven't used for other things. But today, it's almost impossible to say, which way that will go. We have not seen any signs or we don't have any indication that third-party Marine inactivity in the Gulf is going to be any different. But on Multi-Client, until the situation on the future exploration drilling becomes clearer, it's extremely difficult to predict what's going to happen, Jim.", "James Crandell - Barclays Capital", "And if we saw the negative outcome in the Gulf of Mexico persistent to 2011, would you be markedly more cautious on your outlook for better pricing in the Vessel business for 2011 that I think you articulated last quarter?", "Andrew Gould", "So the good news in the Vessel business is despite the Gulf of Mexico, the capacity is still being absorbed. And you're quite right to point out that the question will be, once the capacity is absorbed, if there's no big shooting market, acquisition market in the Gulf of Mexico, will pricing move ahead in 2011? And I have to say, if that is the case, I doubt there would be much pricing leverage.", "James Crandell - Barclays Capital", "Andrew, has your view on whether divestitures will be required as a result of the Smith acquisition change since you announced the acquisition?", "Andrew Gould", "I can't comment on that, Jim.", "James Crandell - Barclays Capital", "And lastly, do you see yourself having a presence in the Gulf of Mexico Stimulation business in the intermediate to longer term?", "Andrew Gould", "It's not high on our priorities.", "Operator", "Next question is from Daniel Boyd with Goldman Sachs & Co. (sic) [Goldman Sachs].", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just a question on the margins in Europe/CIS/Africa. It sounds like from your comments that mix played a part in pretty, almost flattish margins sequentially. How should we think about margins over the next couple of quarters? Always tough to predict mix, but should we see a nice step up there, as sort of mix normalizes, so to speak?", "Andrew Gould", "There are some issues in the mix that we can predict and some that we can't. So the one we can predict, for example, is that in Q2 a lot of the rigs, the offshore rigs were on completion and not drilling. And when this happens, the revenue swings in favor of our competitors rather than us and when they're on drilling, it swings in our favor. So logically, they should swing back to drilling in Q3, which will help. And the exploration success, a lot of the prospects that were being drilled in the second quarter were fairly marginal, quite deliberately fairly marginal on the part of our customers. And the question is, if they swing back to more really perspective exploration in Q3, will that improve the mix or not? But that one is extremely difficult to predict. And North Africa, I think we will probably not see much improvement.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just one follow-up on North America and U.S. Land, it's come up quite a bit in terms of long-term contracts, I guess, especially for stimulation equipment. Are you seeing those? And what are you thoughts on Schlumberger participating in signing long-term contracts?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, yes, we're seeing customers making inquiries. But as my peers pointed out, long-term contracts don't really mean very much in North America, so we're not in a hurry to sign over at this point.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And similar to that, are you also of the thought process that you don't want those margins or returns to get too attractive in North America to prevent potential overcapacity building again?", "Andrew Gould", "I think that the argument that we all have to be conscious of is the argument that what is the correct return on the capital for pressure pumping, and not to let pricing go to the point where the return on capital is so high that it's going to attract a lot of competition, yes, I agree.", "Operator", "The next questions from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Andrew, with regards your international growth prospects or international prospects in general, you mentioned sort of a steady improvement from this point forward with most regions partially offset by what's going on in Mexico. Relative to your perspective of the Q1 or on the Q1 call, which regions internationally are likely to show a more restrained rate of growth relative to what you thought was a case a quarter ago other than Mexico?", "Andrew Gould", "I think that we would say that Latin America, and the rest of Latin America is fine, sorry. So ECA, [Europe/CIS/Africa] I would say that we think the offshore market has slipped by one quarter. So the improvement that we thought we would have in Q2 will come in Q3, et cetera, et cetera, which means that overall, my view of ECA for the year probably hasn't changed very much. If it has, it's a slight negative bias, basically because of North Africa not West Africa. On the other hand, if I had to change my bias for MEA, for Middle East/Asia, it would be slightly more positive than it was at the end of Q1, but skewed towards the end of the year.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "So really net-net, other than Mexico on balance, no real change from what you thought was the case in Q1?", "Andrew Gould", "Not really, no. A little bit of a shift away from Africa towards Asia but apart from that, not really. And of course, Mexico is worse than we thought at the end of Q1 but apart from that, no.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "You mentioned economic uncertainty with regard to perhaps tempering customer appetites a bit. We know it's early, but as you look into 2011, do you hazard a guess with providing us with a framework for international growth?", "Andrew Gould", "I still think that the international growth for oil stems very much off GDP. So if you look at the latest forecast, they're talking about a 4.3% instead of 4.7% in 2011. If that turns out to be the case, I think the oil price will be very healthy and international oil will be good in 2011. If the GDP growth rate slips back then it will affect it consequentially.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Next subject here is Gulf of Mexico and I know that this is a tough question to ask, but just a conceptual one. We had a 30-rig floater market before the spill, likely growing to 40 to 45 rigs. Now we had the spill, and the likely results are going to be increased costs, increased regulation and generally speaking at a given commodity price, probably lower rates of return for the industry in general E&P industry in deepwater Gulf of Mexico midsize and large independents getting marginalized, and really probably becoming the exclusive province of the super major. You went from a 30-rig market, which was the second largest market in the world likely going to, I don't know, something smaller going forward based upon the return profile getting impaired. I don't know what that number is, 15, 20", "rigs, but looking more like Norway as opposed to the Gulf of Mexico. You've conveyed a sense of no real change in strategy, but I'm just curious as to your Gulf of Mexico footprint and cost structure. As you look out over the next couple of years, what should we expect to see?", "Andrew Gould", "Actually, I think that the issue you're raising is not the issue of the additional cost. I think the issue that you're raising, which is the very real issue that our customers will have a great deal of difficulty coming to terms with is what is the ultimate viability going to be; people who own leases in the Gulf of Mexico because that's the thing that will limit the number of operators, not the cost. And so we actually have transferred out something like 200 people to U.S. Land and to other places, and we have loaned 250-odd very skilled engineers, operators, maintenance technicians to other deepwater theaters around the world. So we have actually retained the potential to come back as and when we are asked to come back. And some of this has been in close cooperation with our customers who don't want that potential destroyed. I agree with you that the market is not going to be the 45 rigs that people were talking about as little as four or five months ago. I don't know that it's going to be 15 to 20 because I don't think you're going to be able to define that until you actually know how the liability is going to be defined. There is a risk that you quite rightly point out that this becomes limited to the super majors and perhaps people with national government backing, but I think it's a little too early to assume that. So for the moment, we're doing our best to get the Gulf of Mexico to break even by lending out people and equipment. That's going to be very tough in Q3, and then after that, we'll look and see how it looks afterwards. Now in the longer term, I think that people will adapt their deepwater programs to other theaters where, perhaps, they feel they have a more clement regulatory climate in which to drill. And I don't know whether you looked at the Financial Times yesterday, but there was a very good summary of all the reactions so far around the world in different regulatory bodies to this. And there isn't one yet that has taken and, obviously, they don't have the emotional problem that the U.S. does, has taken such a firm stand against deepwater, and I very much doubt they will.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Simon, could you share with us what the margin improvement was in U.S. Land quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter?", "Simon Ayat", "From the first quarter to the second quarter was 15 percentage points.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "U.S. Land?", "Simon Ayat", "U.S. Land improved by 15 percentage points.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Pickering with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.", "Daniel Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "Andrew, with a lot of moving parts in North America, I heard you talk about taking charge of reorganization, et cetera. I guess I'm just curious, Gulf of Mexico is going to have a full quarter of impact. I assume that means third quarter margins will be down as well as the second. And I'm thinking about how we bounce back from that given cost cuts, et cetera, earned, do you think you'll exit the year -- in other words, Q4 margins are kind of in line with this Q2 level or even better? Or is it going to be tough to get back to these levels by the year end?", "Andrew Gould", "So I mean, the moving parts that we have, Dan, I mean, I have very little -- I have no doubt that U.S. Land margins will continue to improve provided the rig count holds up. Canada will undoubtedly improve from now on because Canada Q2 is there is spring breakup. So the unknown is at what stage can we get the Gulf of Mexico to the point where it's not diluted to the overall U.S. margin. And in Q3, it will be diluted, there's no doubt about it. We haven't had enough time to do all the transfers, the loans, moving of equipment that is necessary to get the Gulf of Mexico to close to break even. So I think you can assume that in Q3, there is a possibility that the effect of the Gulf of Mexico on the other moving parts is to slightly dilute the margin compared to Q2, slightly. But in Q4, I've no doubt that it will rebound, and I think that it will be -- unless something dramatic happens in the Gulf, and that it will be above the levels -- we'll exit the year above the levels we've shown so far this year.", "Daniel Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "And then as we think about the Seismic business, can you remind us again of how much the Gulf of Mexico represents of Multiclient sales and if we think about Q3 and given what's going on in the Gulf of Mexico, is that going to be a break-even business overall Seismic in the third quarter or should it be better than that?", "Andrew Gould", "I think it'll be slightly better than breakeven, Dan, but below Q2 partly because of transits and partly because, as you point out, of lower Multiclient.", "Daniel Pickering - Pickering Energy Partners", "And overall margins for Schlumberger, your thought has been in the Q1 call that Schlumberger margins were going to make a fairly steady upward progression through the year. I mean, given all the moving parts again, Andrew, you see them better than we do obviously, do we manage to continue that? Do you reiterate that [indiscernible] (54:17) level of margins in the second half?", "Andrew Gould", "Can we leave Seismic out of that as we just discussed that? So x seismic, the two things that have changed since I made the statement in Q1 is number one, Gulf of Mexico and number two, the fairly dramatic reduction that's being announced in activity in Mexico. If you extract those two things, I don't change my statements in Q1.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Anderson with JPMorgan.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "Just want to ask you a question about Russia. Russian activities ticked up pretty good this year, even beyond the seasonal recovery. In light of your very good position over there, I just want to get your sense of the sustainability of this market in the next 12 months? And how concerned are you about the new taxes that are being put in place there? Q3 focused entirely on natural gas, so I guess a sense of your oil gas mix over there will be very helpful.", "Andrew Gould", "Well, we don't have a big gas presence in Russia, except in the very high end. So I don't think that, that'll have a dramatic effect. You're quite right that the seasonal rebound in Russia was very strong, and we think that, that will continue through the balance of the summer, and the question always becomes what is the seasonal effect of the winter going to be like next year. And as to the situation for oil with tax, I think you would just need to watch what happens to the overall level of Russian production, and that will very much govern what happens next year.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "On a different subject, going on to Brazil. Last quarter's call, you had talked about that giant sucking sound [ph] (56:07) came out of the Middle East last cycle that drove earnings growth and you were sure that's going to come from this time. In your release today, you highlighted a couple of new stimulation vessels you're putting in there and it just would seem to me that over the next five years, with the deepwater activity down in Brazil that, that could very well be where that sucking sound [ph] comes from this cycle. Do you view it that way? How long do you think that takes to play out or kind of the competitive dynamics different here that makes this a different market for the Middle East in terms of Schlumberger...", "Andrew Gould", "No, I don't think the competitive dynamics is different. What is different is the speed with the ramp up. In other words, in Middle East, the Saudi ramp up took place over an incredibly short period of time. I mean, they basically ramped up three huge projects in the space of three years. There's no way that in an offshore development like Brazil that they can possibly ramp up at the same speed. And therefore, while you're quite right that the markets are going to go on increasing and growing very fast, it will never create, I don't need to create the sucking effect that Saudi Arabia created when they went into their big development projects.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "On WesternGeco, I think you guys were projecting somewhere around 50 3D vessels to be in the global market by the end of the year and maybe a dozen or so on the sidelines. How any of those were you projecting to be in the Gulf of Mexico? And how should we be thinking about if we don't get another lease sale in the next 12 months, which who knows, but if you get three or four or five vessels leaving the market, won't that throw the whole global seismic market into disarray?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't know the answer to your question. As to the precise number of the new vessels we projected going to the Gulf -- talked to [ph] (57:54) WesternGeco this morning, certainly on the basis of the vessel count, they know between now and the end of the year, they are not concerned about utilization.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "But 2011, wild card?", "Andrew Gould", "2011, it's just impossible to know until we have clarity on future exploration activity in the Gulf of Mexico.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Alan Laws of BMO Capital Markets.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I'm going to ask you about the North American market here. Maybe I'm reading into this, but your tone on the U.S. Land seems less pessimistic than it has maybe in the past. Is that a function of your restructuring or changes in your view of the fundamentals and/or maybe demand dynamics? And are you seeing any evidence of investment being swung onshore from the Gulf at this point?", "Andrew Gould", "I mean, the answer to that is no. I haven't seen any major move in investment onshore though they well may be some, particularly with the independents. My view of the fundamentals of gas, I'm sorry, is I'm still puzzled because gas supply is still outstripping the recovery in demand. And the question is I hear all these reasons why people are drilling, but the question is how long is that going to last? And the only assumption I've made, Alan, is it's going to last for the rest of this year. Beyond that, I'm not making any predictions.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So essentially, you're going to take the high-level activity and pocket that and then see what happens?", "Andrew Gould", "Exactly. We're not going to just leave it.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The other thing, last quarter, you'd mentioned decline in deepwater rig rates as a potential catalyst for exploration spending. With kind of recent events, it seems that this may accelerate. Is it too early to expect to see any signs of increased demand for Seismic beyond 2010? And comment maybe, I guess, on how do you think the cycle for Seismic might unfold over the next 18 months?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think that lower rig rates will affect Seismic because most of our customers, particularly the big ones overseas, have portfolios that will allow them to generate exploration drilling prospects without shooting additional seismic. I think the question is at what stage will they be tempted by lower rig rates to increase exploration programs, and I don't think you'll see much of that in 2010. But if the oil price is decent and the rig rates are low, you may well see something of that in 2011.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "What's the level of oil price to incite the incremental Seismic? Does that need to be 80 or 70 and up?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I think it's bouncing towards 80 instead of bouncing all the time toward 70, Alan.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Quick question on the Middle East. It's been interesting to watch the rig count come down and counting [ph] (1:01:36) come back as you pointed out they were a big driver for growth in that region in the previous cycle.

It's not particularly toxic.

It's just the country has not been talked about much in the last couple of quarters. I'm just wondering if you could speak to what's going on in that market.", "Andrew Gould", "I think there's a fairly steady long exploration process that's taking place offshore, and actually there is some interesting work going on on onshore, in gas, particularly even some work in shale gas. So yes, the interest of India in gas is rising, Michael. But apart from the offshore development, I don't think there's anything major yet that they're putting into development.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Is it something that maybe we could see a step up in the next 12 months or is it further out, do you think?", "Andrew Gould", "I think it's probably -- I think there's a lot of work to be done before they know exactly what they want to do.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Switching to U.S. Land, you've mentioned I think on the Smith conference call that we would be moving towards drilling geologically as opposed to geometrically. I heard anecdotes...", "Andrew Gould", "Drilling and completing.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Drilling and completing. I've heard anecdotes that some of these bigger fracs and close proximity wells is that you're getting fluid invasion from one or the other and sort of problems with just sort of getting bigger and louder, so to speak, with the frac.

I don't know. I'll find out, but I don't know. What I can speak to is in these large fracs, the percentage of perforation that actually produce is quite low, and obviously, the more percs [ph] (1:05:01) you frac, the more water you use. And therefore, if you can devise a method on it which you only complete with perforations, we're pretty sure we're going to produce, you're going to use less water, and hopefully, you'll have a more productive well. But I think I would re-emphasize that this is a goal. I don't think we're there yet.", "Operator", "Next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Andrew, given your comments that certainly this recovery is driven by oil activity versus oil and gas, do you believe it's going to be more difficult or take longer before we can push for pricing as it simply will become longer before capacity becomes tight?", "Andrew Gould", "You're talking of CIS [ph] (1:05:55)?", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "International, right.", "Andrew Gould", "Yes, it's obviously the slower the rig count climbs, the longer it's going to take. But it's going to be, I think, more selective by service rather than the general sort of shortage that occurred in 2005, 2006. So it's going to depend very much on the nature of activity. Is it exploration, is development, et cetera?", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "And thus, when you think to the product lines or specific regions, where do you believe we could potentially see pricing gains first?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I still think that the first signs of shortage, or not shortage, but the first signs of our ability to look at pricing because tighter capacity is going to be in drilling tools, probably. But I mean, it's still early days. It's too early to start really knowing. That's more my feeling than any tangible evidence.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "In certain regions over others?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I think it will occur offshore before it occurs on land, put it that way.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "And then when you think about international margins, 2008 you were 29%. Today, we're at 22%. If you think about 2011, is it fair to assume a slow and steady recovery that we would be in the mid-20s or is higher or lower possible?", "Andrew Gould", "Like I said in answer to an earlier question, there's an $80 oil price that would stimulate considerable activity for oil in 2011. And if that's the case, then I don't think, and I said this before, I don't think we'll get back to the 2008 margins if only because of the mix and the speed with which activity is climbing. But certainly, we will have another margin improvement.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Then finally, when you think about international growth in 2011, as far as year-over-year growth, what are your thoughts there as far as percentage or range?", "Andrew Gould", "I'm not going to start giving numbers on 2011, international growth in July 2010. Way too early.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "First of all, it's not that good.", "Andrew Gould", "No.", "Operator", "Next question is from Geoff Kieburtz with Weeden & Co.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "Andrew, in responding to earlier question, you seem sort of -- I think I took the message that your view about the kind of multi-period outlook has not really changed since the first quarter with the exception of Gulf of Mexico and Mexico. On the CapEx side, it seems like you're, through the first half, spending considerably below the run rate that your full year outlook would suggest. What's going on there? Why is that?", "Andrew Gould", "We always do, Geoff. [indiscernible] (1:09:16) stronger. It's nothing new. It's pretty much par for what happens every year because the field wants their CapEx earlier and manufacturing does their best, but they can't necessarily deliver it. So CapEx is always higher in the second half than the first half.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "Is there any sense that supply chain is starting to become constrained?", "Andrew Gould", "Generally, no. There are one or two specific bottlenecks that occur because they're very specialized, but they're not really very [indiscernible] (1:09:52). They're not something that stops its progressing.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "And you've bumped up your WesternGeco CapEx a little bit. It seems a little bit inconsistent with the tone that you've been talking about in the business.", "Andrew Gould", "It's marginal, I think. I don't know where...", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "The equity earnings dropped sequentially in the quarter. Why shouldn't we think that's an indication of what's happening at M-I?", "Simon Ayat", "Well, Geoff, you know the equity line in Schlumberger, it's a mix of several items. There is a bit of impact coming from the deepwater moratorium, I think, on some of our investments, not necessarily on the M-I, but it's a mix. You will always see a bit of a fluctuation.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "And, Simon, could you give us any guidance? You mentioned in the release that Geoservice did impact revenues somewhat in the quarter? Can you give us any idea of magnitude and/or regions that were impacted?", "Simon Ayat", "So, Geoff, it's one month as a matter fact. In the month of June, we account for Geoservices on a one-month lag, so it's a one month only that was reported in the second quarter. It's very marginal, and it is spread over most of the areas outside North America, more outside North America than inside North America. And it's a very marginal, really. It's one month only.", "Operator", "Next question's from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Andrew, you talked a lot about your expectations in the deepwater as it relates to the Gulf of Mexico incident and the impact on activity internationally. I'm just curious if you could talk a little bit about with people and equipment now making those moves internationally, in some cases, if they're not going to U.S. Land. Can you just talk about the pricing environment whether or not that's got more competitive even if activity stays similar, in your mind, but activity or pricing gets more competitive?", "Andrew Gould", "So in deepwater, we have not seen, and I do not expect to see on existing contracts any request to revive that pricing because more service capacities become available. I think that people are going to stick with their contracts and worry more about service quality and risk than they do about pricing. As to new bids, we haven't actually submitted very many since this happened, Bill, so I can't give you an intelligent answer. Yes, obviously, pricing will, on new bids, probably suffer a bit. I would reiterate that I think anyone drilling in deepwater these days is not going to want to take risks.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Do you expect the length of the contracts, the service contracts, you'll bid in deepwater offshore markets to be similar, Andrew, as a result of this? Or do you think guys will look for shorter as they want to see what the impacts of maybe additional capacity could mean longer term to the market?", "Andrew Gould", "I think that, in this year, if there is any rebidding or programs that are bid, they're likely to be short term. And we'll only see return to the longer-term commitments next year.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil", "As far as the name [ph] (1:13:41) restructuring is concerned, do you think we're done by the end of the third quarter on that? And I guess it was a comment made earlier, but you didn't see any benefit in your 2Q margins from the restructuring. I'm just curious if you can give us an idea, structurally going forward, what kind of basis point margin improvement do you think you can get in your U.S. onshore or your North American as a whole as a result of this restructuring? Is that something you could quantify for us?", "Andrew Gould", "We think that will be highly competitive with our competitors by the time that we finish as equal mix.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Is third quarter pretty much a conclusion of this? Do you think you're done by that point, Andrew?", "Andrew Gould", "I think a lot will have been achieved by the end of the third quarter, but I think as I originally said, it's 2011.", "Operator", "We have time for another question and that comes from the line of Robin Shoemaker with Citigroup.", "Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc", "Andrew, I wanted to just get your thoughts about the IPM business. Presumably, when Mexico rebounds, that market, as it definitely will, that will play an important role. But is there any change to your thinking about the IPM business model internationally? In terms of the very strong outlook you had and today?", "Andrew Gould", "No, I think that the only change in the outlook we have for IPM is that it's twofold, actually. First is that the portfolio is becoming much more balanced between Latin America and the rest of the world because it was originally fairly highly concentrated in Latin America; and secondly, there are two types of well construction contracts evolving partly because of Iraq, one of which is the Mexico one, which is, as you know, is very much lump-sum performance-based, not necessarily the most attractive; and the ones in Iraq, which I think will be much more disciplined and more the execution contracts rather than risk contracts.", "Robin Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc", "Are there any -- as some national oil companies become increasingly more technologically capable and sophisticated, do you see IPM becoming less important in those countries or more?", "Andrew Gould", "The long-term objective of IPM from the very beginning was not to drill wells. It was to assist in the management of mature production and the business case for assisting the management in mature production for an oil company, national or otherwise, is that they don't have enough internal capacity to do everything they want to do. And we are seeing encouraging signs that, that shift is beginning to take place. So over the long term, while well construction, I think, will always remain a part of it, packaged well construction, we think that the long-term future is in the management or assisting in the management in mature production.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Julie will now closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 a.m. today through midnight, August 23, 2010.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr.  Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2010 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statement. And now I will turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.85 per share. This is an increase of $0.15 sequentially and $0.18 compared to the same quarter of last year. ", "During the quarter, we recorded $0.09 of charges relating to the repurchase of certain bonds and other merger-related items. We anticipate we would continue to incur merger-related charges throughout 2011, as we continue the integration of Smith. ", "The Q4 results include a full quarter of activity from the acquired Smith companies as compared to only one month in the Q3. We have continued to make significant progress on our integration during the quarter, and while the transaction was dilutive to the quarter's result by approximately $0.05, we continue to believe it will be breakeven by the end of the fourth quarter of this year. ", "Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue increased 9% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue increased 17%. The legacy Smith businesses contributed $2.5 billion in revenue for the quarter. Approximately 25% of the growth in Oilfield Services was attributable to the traditional year end surge in product and software sales. The remaining increase was largely due to the continued strong Well Services performance in U.S. Land, as well as the revenue generated from the early payout of an IPM [Integratd Project Management] gain share project in North America. ", "Oilfield Services pretax operating income of $1.3 billion increased 21% compared to the prior quarter. While pretax operating margin increased 224 basis points to 22.1%. This increase was largely driven by the strong performance in North America where margin improved by 6.6 percentage points. ", "Now margins grew 658 basis points to 24% led by U.S. Land. The early payout of the IPM gain share project, which contributed approximately $0.02 to the fourth quarter earnings per share accounted for just over 2 percentage points of the North America margin improvement. International margins improved sequentially by 49 basis points to 21.9%. This improvement was primarily driven by a more favorable revenue mix in the Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and North Sea GeoMarkets. In the Middle East, pretax operating margin decreased as effects of year-end product and software sales were not sufficient to offset the impact of the weather-related delays in Australia, start-up costs in Iraq and an overall less favorable revenue mix. ", "Sequentially, WesternGeco pretax operating income increased by $73 million to $113 million and pretax operating margin increased by almost 12 percentage points to 20.2% on account of robust monthly client sales. The legacy Smith segment, particularly Smith Oilfield Services performed very well, contributing $275 million of pretax operating income to the quarter's results. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 23.1%, representing an increase of just over 2 percentage points compared to last quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the fact that we generated a significantly larger portion of our earnings in North America in the Q4, as well as the continued impact of the Smith merger. We expect the ETR for the full year of 2011 to be in the mid-20s. This reflects the planned mix of activity between North America and the rest of the world, as well as the full-year impact of the Smith merger. However, I continue to remind you that we can experience volatility on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business.", "We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of $1.7 billion. Net debt was $2.6 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $3.5 billion at the end of Q3. This improvement reflects very strong cash collections in the fourth quarter. ", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter, included $1 billion of CapEx, $449 million of stock repurchases and $200 million contribution to our retiree medical plan. ", "During the quarter, we issued $1.3 billion of 2.75% notes due in 2015. And subsequent to the quarter end, we issued $1.1 billion of 4.2% notes due in 2021 and $500 million of 2.65% notes due in 2016. ", "Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 19% increase in our dividend, which brings our annual dividend to $1 per share. This increase reflects the fact that we have not increased our dividend over the past two years and is consistent with our intention to return excess cash to our shareholders. Along the same lines, we will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive, when appropriate with our stock buyback activity. ", "Throughout all of 2010, we spent $1.7 billion repurchasing 26.6 million shares at an average price of $64.48. Despite the fact that we were blacked out for a significant period as a result of the Smith transaction. CapEx for all of Schlumberger is expected to approach $4 billion in 2011 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2010. ", "Lastly, I just want to remind everyone that starting next quarter, our primary segment reporting will be based on our group structure. In this regard, shortly after this call, we will be publishing an update to the pro forma financial information that were released in early December to reflect the Q4 and full year 2010 result in this new format. This information can be found on our website. And now, I will turn the conference over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould", "Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Schlumberger fourth quarter revenue was at $9.07 billion versus $6.85 billion in the third quarter of 2010 and $5.74 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. These figures reflect the full quarter of activity from the acquired Smith businesses. ", "In Oilfield Services, North America activity remained strong through growing demand for services in liquid-rich plays and from seasonal improvements in Canada. Improved pricing and the restructuring efforts that we began in April continued to contribute to margin expansion, particularly for Well Services activities. Results also benefited from the accelerated IPM gain share on the sale by the customer for projects on land in the U.S., which clearly demonstrates how this business model can create value. ", "Outside North America, activity improvements in the North Sea, West Africa and Middle East & Asia  GeoMarkets, coupled with strong year and product sales, particularly for software, more than offset the combination of continued weakness in Mexico and the seasonal activity decline in Russia. While this was balanced to some degree by the rapid ramp up of activity in Iraq, which did not yield equivalent profitability as it was impacted by heavy start-up costs. ", "Our WesternGeco, excellent fourth quarter multiclient sales were mostly due to the enhanced quality of subsalt imaging products in the Gulf of Mexico, while the acquired Smith businesses continue to outperform our original expectations with revenue synergies, through the acquisition, increasing in each successive month of the quarter. ", "This quarterly report is particularly rich in technical success, whether through the continuing market penetration of leading services such as the Scope advanced logging-while-drilling measurements, scanner Wireline technologies or ACTive coiled tubing services, the integrated nature of the portfolio underscored considerable success. ", "Scanner services, for example, are being boosted by the commercial introduction of the latest family member, the Dielectric Scanner, the unique industry service capable of measuring saturation and a variety of reservoir applications, the service completed a two-year pilot project in Saudi Arabia, targeted at reservoir monitoring where 35 logs have been recorded in various fields, both on land and offshore to assess water flooding sweep efficiency as an aid to field development planning. The result showed the technology is capable of determining oil saturation, independent of water salinity while achieving efficiency gains over previous monitoring methods, and have now led to the service being considered for use in heavy oil and [indiscernible] sand environments. ", "In Reservoir production, ACTive realtime coiled tubing services saw growth particularly with the ACTive conveyance of wireline close scanner production logging technology and with fiber optics' continuous measurements of temperature and pressure along the wellbore. Expanding the primary integrated technologies such as these, confirmed conveyance enabled wireline services to have exciting growth opportunities, particularly in horizontal and extended reach wells. ", "It is however, in the drilling portfolio that displayed some of the most exciting successes. These included the completion of the remote three-well exploration project offshore Greenland that use Schlumberger technologies combined with Smith and M-I SWACO services, as well as Geoservices mud logging. In Brazil, a similar combination of services helped one well record substantial increases in rates of penetration while meeting all the directional drilling goals. In this case, the integrated nature of the bottomhole assembly demonstrated how technology optimization can impact performance in the high cost deepwater drilling environment. A third such operation offshore Indonesia, further confirm the value of integrated bottomhole assemblies. ", "Finally, I would like to mention the inauguration of two new Schlumberger facilities in Brazil to support one of becoming the fastest-growing regions in the world. On November 16, we opened the Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center in Rio de Janeiro. And the following day, our latest new generation operations based in Maca\u00e9.  The new research center is designed to promote the integration of geosciences and engineering to improve hydrocarbon production and recovery from the complex deep water reservoirs and pre-salt carbonates offshore Brazil. The center also has as a new WesternGeco geo-solutions center dedicated to processing of the revolutionary single-vessel full azimuth Q-Marine services that have now penetrated all the major offshore areas around the world. ", "As we look forward to 2011, it is important to remember that the primary driver of our business has always been and will remain the demand for oil and gas. For oil, 2010 turned out to be the year of the second largest demand increase in the last 30 years. The consensus forecast of demand in 2011 shows a further healthy increase. Oil prices are moving to a range that would encourage increased investment particularly in exploration, which remains the swing factor in operators' budgets. While we do not anticipate any substantial recovery in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we do expect a marked increase in deep water activity in the rest of the world. These factors, coupled with increases in development activity and production enhancement in many other areas promise stronger growth rate as the year unfolds. ", "For natural gas, demand recovery has been less marked. The increases in supply of both unconventional gas in the United States and liquified natural gas around the world will limit the progress of prices. Nonetheless, activity in the United States is likely to remain strong, at least through the first half of the year, due to commitments necessary to retain leases, the backlog of wells to be completed and the contribution of natural gas liquids to overall project economics. Increased service capacity, however, will negatively affect pricing at some stage during the year. ", "Overseas, the governing factor on gas activity, particularly in the Middle East will be the ability of many nations to use gas as a substitute for oil to meet increased local energy demand, thus freeing up more liquids for export. Elsewhere, the long lead time necessary to execute large gas projects for LNG exports will ensure that a certain level of activity is maintained. ", "Unconventional gas resources will continue to attract considerable interest outside North America. The leading activity will continue to be in conventional gas, in tight or low permeability reservoirs and in coal-bed methane development. There will be exploration activity around the potential that shale gas offers in many other parts of the world. ", "Increased activity, coupled with greater technology needs of higher exploration, deepwater spend and tight gas, particularly outside North America, will make 2011 a stronger year for Schlumberger. The importance of risk reduction and the minimization of drilling cost make the acquisitions of Geoservices and Smith, major contributors to our future growth in this scenario. Thank you. And Julie, I think we're ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "I guess, and then the first question, I would just love to hear a little bit more on what was a very impressive revenue growth number in the U.S. land market? For just a little bit more color, if you would, sort of utilization of assets, if you could comment on capacity increase and then on pricing, that would be helpful?", "Andrew Gould", "The biggest contributors in Q4 as opposed to Q3 were still efficiency gains in activity, with some contribution though not huge from increased capacity. So it really was more the results of the restructuring efforts. In terms of price, the Q4 effect was less than the Q3 effect. So it really was the results of the restructuring efforts, much better efficiency and much better utilization that led the improvement.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Perhaps as a follow-up, let's stick with the same part of the world, could you offer some thoughts on the Gulf of Mexico and your outlook? I know you spoke to it a little bit in your comments, but your outlook for the next couple of quarters specifically, and then, also as we move into the end of this year?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think we anticipate any major return to work in the first half of the year. I think we may see a few rigs come back, but we still think that there are a number of issues that the operators really need clear resolution on, before they are in a position to apply for new permits. And we anticipate that in the second half of the year, the rate of increase will accelerate, but we don't think we're going back to anything like the 33 rigs that we're drilling when the moratorium started in 2011.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "But you're assuming that your...", "Andrew Gould", "In 2012, if you're asking do I doubt the future of deepwater Gulf of Mexico? Absolutely not. And I think that our multi-client sales we are very good proxy for the fact that there is still a huge interest in deepwater Gulf of Mexico. But until some of the questions around the regulation and the definition of liability and the definition to what constitutes well containment is settled, it's difficult to know exactly who the client base is going to be.", "Operator", "The next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Andrew, you referenced, obviously, on your commentary the IPM project in North America. And you put that to impact in the commentary as well. So I'm just curious here. Can you elaborate a little bit more on this IPM gain sharing project and can you elaborate more on how this business model has evolved for Schlumberger and how can we think about that impacting Schlumberger differentially compared to its peers as we move forward?", "Andrew Gould", "So the project in question was in the Bakken. The owner of the project was a private equity, so therefore we did absolutely everything. We invested service as our share of the investment. Normally, we would have been paid out on the ratio of our services over the balance of the whole project life. But the agreement contained a resolution in case if the owners selling the property, which gave us the same multiple on our invested services cost as the seller obtained on his sale. So what I'm saying is that it is unlikely that these projects get sold very often because it's far more likely that a continue for a long period of time, particularly outside the United States where they tend to be with national oil companies rather than with private investors. But it does demonstrate how well our technology allows the customer to create considerable value in a short period of time, how we can share in it.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "So in the context of that, as we think about this from a financial community standpoint, it's something that could recur, but it's something...", "Andrew Gould", "No. It's something which is providing a new income agreement in Schlumberger, which is not particularly visible yet, it is not big enough. But very satisfactory returns. The only reason you saw this in one quarter was because the operator sold it. And overseas particularly, it's unlikely that operators, particularly as the national oil companies will sell them, so the gain will be spread over the contract life as opposed to come in one quarter.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "In U.S., you referenced, again, some concern about potential pricing pressure in the market. How would you characterize your conviction in that perspective? And is it something that we could be looking to update and change maybe on a quarter-on-quarter basis?", "Andrew Gould", "I mean, I don't -- I've been wrong on North America so often Kurt, that I'm reluctant to say too much. I don't think there's a huge risk to activity in the first half of the year. I do think that pricing momentum is going to slow progressively. But at the point where it tips over, I suspect it's going to depend on when the capacity out there is sufficient to address the current activity. And it looks, it's in fact, in the second half of the year, not the first.", "Operator", "The next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Andrew, when do you think that, most probably, is the first exploration well and deep well in Gulf of Mexico?", "Andrew Gould", "I'm going to go out on a limb here, and say the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2012. Are you're saying rank exploration or delineation?", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Rank exploration.", "Andrew Gould", "2012. I'm going out on a limb, I'm guessing.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "So could talk a little bit about what could -- your thought process around why 2012 and the...", "Andrew Gould", "Well, but for all the reasons I gave to Brad earlier. Firstly, while there's some of the regulations have been defined, some of them haven't, the need for environmental assessments and spill containment capability is on the way but is not yet there and it's not yet, I think, necessarily clearly understood how the operators are going to share that. I think that the operators are not going to commit until they're pretty sure of the framework within which they're going to operate. And I just doubt that for ranked exploration, we're going to get that clarity in 2011.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "And if we look elsewhere in the world, what you'll see is the most prospective exploration basis at the moment, and whether it'd be seismic activity or well testing or any other of your exploration-oriented services, are there any new basins that could, in 2011, pick up the slack from Gulf of Mexico?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I mean, when we look at -- let me answer you that another way. When we a look at deepwater in 2011, the number of effective rig years added, so this is not the number of rigs added, it's the number of rig years, which is the number of months they're actually drilling, right? It is much is substantially greater than in 2010. And if I leave aside Brazil, where everybody knows the story and you can, to some extent, make your own estimate of how may rigs will actually get added, then I think the most prospective area we're going to see in terms of deepwater exploration in 2011 is West and East Africa. And to some extent, remote Indonesia.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "What are your thoughts on WesternGeco in this context? Is the fact that the Gulf of Mexico is a bit of a vacuum, maybe this year a problem or is the international momentum strong enough?", "Andrew Gould", "We think that the momentum in proprietary seismic outside of the United States is sufficient to absorb capacity, but the lack of the Gulf of Mexico is going to slow pricing. We thought we would get pricing momentum back early this year. We are now thinking that if we do get it back, it's going to be late this year. The big question I think on seismic for 2011 is if there is prospectively a large lease sale at the beginning 2012, then multiclient could be very strong in the second half of this year.", "Operator", "The next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Partners.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "If I could ask a question on fracing, as it relates to a comment you made earlier. Last year, about drilling geometrically versus drilling geologically. The frac market has been essentially geometric as well, but there's evidence that, that market is perhaps migrating more towards an intelligent model faster than the shale drilling market in North America. Could you talk about that?", "Andrew Gould", "What are you comparing to the shale market? The liquid market or what? The drilling...", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I'm sorry, I'm referring to drilling versus completions, and the trend of geometric to geologic activity.", "Andrew Gould", "I think you have to assume that over time, that you call it geologically. But geologically, what we're trying to do is to drill in such a way that we can identify the place where we want to have completions instead of geometrically completing it because we don't really know where the sweet spots are. We can't classify them well enough to do in other ways. I think that progress is being made. I think that this is going to go faster outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. for the reason that a lot of the environmental concerns and the infrastructure concerns that can be addressed in the North American market cannot be addressed overseas, and therefore, people are going to be a lot more careful. And we, definitely, are seeing that. So over time, yes, I still believe that completions will be designed geologically as opposed to geometrically. And that drilling & measurements will become a tool to reduce the intensity of fracs, but we're not there yet.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "But those markets are essentially trending in tandem as opposed to -- it strikes me that perhaps the completions market with microseismic and variable staging is perhaps moving more towards an intelligent model faster than...", "Andrew Gould", "Yes, I don't think we would include microseismic in that because microseismic is a saltwater service. In other words, it's done after the frac. What we're talking about is services that are rendered before the fact in such a way that you design the completion to minimize the footprint and eliminate the fracs, but inevitably the preparations for the frac can never produce anything.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "For a follow-on, can you talk quickly about the reservoir surveillance collaborations with Shell and what that the broader opportunity might look like?", "Andrew Gould", "We are seeing a very considerable increase in business associated around the design of EOR programs, particularly in the Middle East. Shell is very active, particularly in Oman in EOR. And the programs that we have with Shell are around services where our capacity to do characterization with downhole tools can be matched with Shell's knowledge of how the reservoir behaves. And I would say that the collaboration at the moment is linked to two very specific services and going forward, we'll see how it goes.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Is it a scalable model though?", "Andrew Gould", "I'm sorry in terms of collaboration?", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "In terms of participating and the size of programs with other operators?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, to be honest Michael, we have programs and this is what we liked about Brazil, really, as I talked about Petrobras, right? And I mean, in the same we have it with the many others around the world. In this particular case, Shell wanted to make press release.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "So it falls within the classification of generally technical collaboration?", "Andrew Gould", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Urban with Deutsche Bank.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG", "Andrew, you talked about exploration as a swing factor in operator budgets. Is that something that you're already seeing and is reflected in your current outlook? Or would you view it as upside as you see, I guess oil demand continue to improve in confidence, improving as the commodity price hold up?", "Andrew Gould", "I think it's a little bit of both. I mean, I think everybody noticed that Total made a public statement about the amount of exploration that we're going to do. And when we visit potentially strong exploration GeoMarkets at this point in time, we find customers making a lot of inquiries that they weren't making 3 months ago. So a lot of it will be second-half year. And why is it the swing factor? It's the swing factor because it's the only thing they can ramp up quickly. They can't ramp up big new development projects quickly because the amount of engineering that's necessary. And therefore, the swing factor is exploration, and to some extent, trying to enhance production from existing fields.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG", "And unrelated follow-up, on the CapEx side, a decent increase but less than might have thought, given that you have a full year of the Smith. Is that function of better asset utilization and synergies between the two or is that something that we could see under upward pressure because opportunities materialize or cost inflation or...", "Andrew Gould", "So firstly, we will review CapEx particularly in the CapEx-intensive segments every quarter. And any CapEx that we authorize in the end of March, for example, will hit the end of the year. If it's beyond that, it's 2012. You have to remember that Smith is not a CapEx intensive business. It was not a CapEx intensive business nearly to the extent that Schlumberger is, so you can assume that the bulk of the increase is Schlumberger not Smith.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Andrew, similar to the exercise that you took us through on deepwater, in terms of markets that are expected to witness the most pronounced positive rate of change year-over-year. Can you walk us through that exercise for international onshore markets? 2011 versus 2010, what looks to witness the biggest positive deltas ex-Iraq?", "Andrew Gould", "Sort of the one huge unknown, which is Mexico, right? And if you exclude that, then you have to assume that Russia will be very positive, could be. I don't think that the recent change in the export duty law that was announced a couple of days ago will have a great deal effect in 2011 because most of the guys have fixed their budgets already. Then I think you have to assume that places like Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Land Brazil, where you have a lot of new independent operators. That we will see a recovery in what was a very weak North Africa in 2010. Weak, as you know, for a number of reasons, but we should see some recovery this year until the extent that the oil price is higher, then it will be that much better.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Are there markets which are building over and mobilizing over the course of this year, which set up for a very strong or much stronger 2012? Two markets, for example, which come to mind, which have announced significant multiyear spending programs.  KPC, a $90 billion program over 5 to 7, 8 years, something like that. ADNOC putting $60 billion dollars to work in Zakum, places like that. I mean, are there markets that are really mobilizing hard in '11 that's set up for a much bigger 2012?", "Andrew Gould", "Yes.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Which are?", "Andrew Gould", "I will mention 2 obvious ones. Yes. If you look back into the 2004, 2007 cycle, the only country in the Middle East that substantially increased its oil production was Saudi Arabia. And I think the Saudis feel that it's time the neighbors do their bit.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "And then the second lined of inquiry, if you will, is North America, and not going to pin you down here with regard to when exactly margins roll, but I guess in terms of your expectation here, using '06 to 2008 before the world came going to an end as an analog, when we had the capacity growth and then the market became more balanced and the margins over kind of '06 to '08 normalize, if you will, and if I look at Schlumberger, specifically, your margins peaked out at 30%, 31% in North America. And then, over two years, basically you regressed to kind of a low 20s range. So it wasn't a collapse, but it was a normalization.", "Andrew Gould", "Can I just say, it was a lot better than previous cycle though.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Indeed. And those are good margins even in sort of a normalized state. And so I'm wondering, is the expectation this time around for a similar evolution or are you looking for something more dramatic with regard to a margin response based upon all the capacity that's coming?", "Andrew Gould", "You mean capacity...", "William Herbert - Simmons", "No, the impact on capacity. You mentioned that sensibly, that you think that the pricing momentum is going to slow and the implicit statement there is that margin is obviously, but that momentum is going to slow as well, and at some point, they're going to roll. And I guess what I'm interested in is your perspective with regard to the evolution of that margin roll, is it a normalization or is it a more dramatic reduction in margins over time? What's your expectation at this stage?", "Andrew Gould", "I think that the service intensity is such that absent the collapse in the oil price, because the collapse in the gas price we basically have already. Absence the collapse in the price that there will be a normalization but not a total collapse. In North America I'm talking about.", "Operator", "It comes from the line of Daniel Boyd with Goldman Sachs.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Andrew, I'd like to just to get your thoughts on the progression of margins internationally? Just when you think about there are three drivers, right? There's pricing, volumes but then there's also mix that can be impacted as you upsell technology. Can you just give us your thoughts on where you are on the pricing front, but also, where you're on the product and exploration cycle? Seismic isn't picking up, but you did mention in the commentary that you had a poor mix in the Middle East?", "Andrew Gould", "The fourth quarter is traditionally not a great mix in the Middle East because of the Artificial Lift in completion sales, which obviously have lower margins than our measurement technology. I think that international margins, bidding international markets on large developments will remain for comparable technology extremely competitive because everyone wants to grow overseas. But the higher the oil the price is, the more people are in a hurry, the more exploration they do, the more that we are going to be able to upgrade our technology sales. And if you remember, I think, I said publicly on several occasions that we actually did slow technology introduction a little bit in 2009, 2010 because we felt that the pricing environment was not such that we could realize the full value. I think you will see in 2011 and 2012 the rate at which we introduced new technology, particularly towards the end of this year and even most importantly in 2012, it's going to increase considerably.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then a follow-up on a comment you made earlier, on one hand you have exploration, which oil companies can pick up quickly, but then you also have work on mature field, which I know it goes back to the root of IPM. Can you comment on whether you're -- are you seeing IPM bidding activity on mature fields picking up? And what type of growth rate could we expect as we look out over the year?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think, well -- IPM tends to be a huge project or nothing. So is the dollar volume of projects on which we're bidding are much higher? It's much, much higher. But actually how many deals we will land, and what effect it will have an 2011 is very difficult to put a number on. So I've absolutely learned, no doubt we will land a couple of big deals, but I suspect they're more likely to be significant in 2012 rather than 2011.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Andrew, do you just come out which regions are you're seeing that activities increasing the most?", "Andrew Gould", "I would much rather not. I'm not going to give a roadmap to some of my friends.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Andrew, I was hoping perhaps you could talk a little bit about, just in the short-term how we should think about the progression in Eastern hemispheres as we look at fourth quarter to first quarter with product and software sales not recurring in 1Q, and more intense whether Russian say the North Sea causing them seasonal disruptions there. How do we think about the progression for the first quarter either top line, in margin in Eastern hemispheres as a whole or maybe some sort of cents per share that you could patch that for us, perhaps that's a bit of question for Simon.", "Andrew Gould", "Well, we don't give guidance, Bill, as you know. But we won't be as totally surprised if the earnings, EPS in Q1 is lower than in Q4, because of the seasonality of both the Russian market, which you know is very large for us. The weather effects of the North Sea and the absence of the sales, the product and software sales that we have been known for. And the big number there, of course, is that Q4 is always the highest quarter for multiclient seismic, and which did extremely well, and Q1 will be much lower in, of course, Mexico.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "I know we've especially reiterated outlook as it relates to an expected kind of breakeven expectation on Smith by fourth quarter '11. In the past, you've quantified the cost savings related to this deal. I think we've heard more positive commentary about the revenue synergies here. Anything, Andrew in terms of mix that's changing your outlook and how you get to breakeven, at some point, do we start getting a little bit more quantification on the revenue pull-through or revenue synergies you see from the Smith deal?", "Andrew Gould", "Bill, we will give you a full update on revenue and cost synergies at Investor Day in Boston in February, Bill.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of David Anderson of JPMorgan.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "Just a quick question for Simon, or it's about -- in your release, you've mentioned a $0.05 gain of inventory adjustments. I assume that is mostly North America. If so, did that contribute to the sequential market margin gain this quarter, North America? Just trying to get ahead on how sustainable these margins are?", "Simon Ayat", "No, this is actually related to the Smith integration. That's not only North America. It's total and it is a step up in inventory that you know it gets amortized over the period of the consumption of the inventory. No, it has no impact on the sequential gain in North America.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "And Andrew, just want to move on to the Middle East. In your comment and your statements, you were talking about gas in the Middle East. And it's pretty obvious, we all know the region is short of gas, but it doesn't seem to really be sense of urgency over there on the part of the NOCs. How do you see that playing out in the next couple of years? And how much of the catalyst can this be for your business do you think?", "Andrew Gould", "You cannot be talking to the same NOCs as I am, David, because without mentioning names, we see considerable urgency and worry, which is reflected in, for example, in a lot of exploration work that we're doing in one country. And the fact that we are heavily participating in the gas development in another country, so I don't know where you got your information though. I don't see it at all, that way.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "Just in terms of market dynamics in the Middle East. If you go back and we compare it now to late \u201805. How do you see the kind of the overall competition kind of playing out. It seems like some of your competitors have used that downturn to buildout capacity. Are you concerned about, at all, about share losses or do you think that the gas side can more than make up for any kind of capacities that's been built up out there?", "Andrew Gould", "First, you going to have to identify the share losses for me because we don't see them. We don't make press releases every time we win a contract. And it's not -- the spectacular announcement that we made had been in markets where we didn't participate very much anyway. So we don't see any significant share loss across the Middle East and in fact, in one or two of the new programs we see significant share gains.", "Operator", "We'll move on to the line of Alan Laws with BMO Capital Markets.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I guess, my first question will be on the international shale here. A commentary on this, or on the opportunities around this sort of dominated your press release and spoken commentary here this morning. Can you talk about the expectations here, maybe in the areas of the regional growth and maybe how this may affect your expectations or relative growth in mix, a D&E versus completion services?", "Andrew Gould", "I was very careful to say in the commentary that the principal activity in unconventional gas, not shale. Unconventional gas in the international market for the next year or so is going to be in tight gas that is low permeability formation. That is pretty general across the Eastern hemisphere, particularly in North Africa and Middle East, to some extent in Russia. And coal-bed methane, which is essentially Australia. The international shale gas activity, which is going on at the moment can be classified very much as exploration activity as opposed to development because, as for the reasons I mentioned before, there is no way that the overseas people can mobilized the land or the infrastructure or the environmental constraints the same way as in the United States. And therefore, they're going to be much more careful before they go into full scale development. And in terms of unconventional gas develop -- or shale gas exploration overseas, we have a very high participation. The essential places where this is taking place at the moment are Poland, Argentina, India, Algeria and China. And tight gas would be the Middle East, and Russia, and to a certain extent, North Africa.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So it's big D&E late in activity still?", "Andrew Gould", "Look, you're not going to get me to say the international market is going to go to the same fracing solutions as the U.S. because they won't. Yes, it's drilling and evaluations at the moment. Fracing will always be a part of it and therefore, fracing is important once they've done their D&E to see how these wells are actually going to flow, but it is not going to be on the scale of the U.S.", "Alan Laws - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "My follow-up is international pricing question. When you look at your current spare capacity and notionally, that of your peers, how long do you think it will take to absorb this capacity to a point where pricing becomes a material contributor?", "Andrew Gould", "I've always said that it doesn't depend on the capacity. It depends on the rate of acceleration in activity. Therefore, the significant pricing traction in services that all the principal oilfield service companies can provide to take place would require a much greater activity increase that we see at this point in time. And I suspect that if it does happen, it's going to be because oil prices are sustained roundabout $90 to $100 into 2012.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Doug Becker with Bank of America.", "Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Andrew, you've highlighted a number of times that new technology introductions will accelerate in late 2011 and 2012. I generally think of new technology, just introduced over the last 5 years, accounting for about 30% of revenue in any given year. Is just in the ballpark for Schlumberger? Is that revenue mix of new technology for Schlumberger, whatever that is, meaningfully below normal right now given the downturn in 2009 and in 2010?", "Andrew Gould", "Yes, it's been meaningfully below the normal. And therefore, the acceleration in the rate of which we introduced will be a meaningful increment.", "Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Andrew, is that 30% figure in the ballpark?", "Andrew Gould", "No, it's a little high. For the oilfield services industry. But, in fact, if this is a very -- has been difficult area because everyone puts their own metric on what they call new technology.", "Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Switching to Mexico. Still seeing weakness in that market. Are there any signs of a meaningful recovery in 2011 and what do you see the implications of the performance-based contracts in Mexico being for Schlumberger?", "Andrew Gould", "I think the there is -- in my mind, there is considerable uncertainty around how the PEMEX budget gets spent in 2011. I don't think it's necessarily going to be exactly what was laid out. And therefore, we remain very cautious on the overall level of activity in Mexico. We think it will be good in the South. We think there'll be some improvement offshore. But as far as the North is concerned, we were quite reluctant to be anything, other than very conservative. In terms of the performance contracts, the only ones that have been let out so far is so small, that I don't think they are great interest to us and possibly not the other service companies. I think the first wave will probably go to local Mexican companies. And obviously, we will be bidding with local Mexican companies to provide the services necessary to execute the contracts. I think that the first wave is to test the system and the really interesting ones will come later.", "Douglas Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch", "And later being potentially 2012?", "Andrew Gould", "Yes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Andrew, could you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing specifically in Iraq and Russia? On Iraq, obviously, you had high start up of cost in Q4. Do you expect that to continue into Q1, as well as Q2, and thus, the margins as for the rest of the year generally? And then on Russia, activity growth outlook for 2011 and color on the Asia the duration asset swap as and when you're getting traction in the region?", "Andrew Gould", "So on Iraq, our revenue in the fourth quarter was closer to $50 million than $10 million. We have three rigs drilling for BP. We are currently mobilizing three rigs for Exxon Mobil. We are providing services to a number of other customers on a callout basis and on a discrete basis. We have inherited some business from Smith in Kurdistan. So we will have further start up cost in Q1, but we are optimistic that we will break even in Q1, be profitable in Q2, and we will, with careful contract management, have an ambition to be in double-digit margins by the end of the year.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "And on Russia?", "Andrew Gould", "Russia? Western Siberia will have a better year. Sakhalin will have some slowdown because basically one of our customers is doing a six-month rig move. And the rest of it, Eastern Siberia I think we'll continue to see some good exploration and development in some of the new fields. So overall Russia will have a better year than it did in 2010. But not a gangbusters year because of the slowing in Sakhalin.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "And then as unrelated follow-up, you mentioned in the press release, you're seeing revenue synergies from Smith and specifically, you mentioned drill bits in Brazil. Where else are you seeing revenue synergies, as far by product line or region? And are you seeing traction with PathFinder internationally?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, the answer is all over. And actually, again, I would much rather that we gave you a comprehensive update at the Investor Day in February, and then, piecemeal stuff now. But synergies are all over.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Geoff Kieburtz with Weeden.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "In the press release, you talked about stronger growth rates as the year unfolds. How should we think about the trajectory? I think that comment refers to international growth and related to your comment earlier about pricing being tied to the pace of growth?", "Andrew Gould", "I think that the best proxy for the growth rate going through the year is going to be the rates which you see offshore rigs either coming in the service as new builds or being contracted after the existing fleet. Because as I said in answer to an earlier question, we could see a lot of inquiries but the rigs don't yet have contracts, so it's likely to be second-half.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "You've also mentioned several times the expectation of increased exploration activity. You've made these comments, forecast before. It doesn't seem like they've necessarily come to fruition in the past. What's your confidence level on this increase in exploration activity?", "Andrew Gould", "I was extremely confident last year until Macondo. Macondo, as I said before, put significant delays all over the world, not because people abandoned programs, but because everybody wanted to check their rigs before they proceeded. We think most of the Macondo delay is behind us, outside the United States. And that the number of rig years from new builds in 2011 is significantly higher than in 2010. So my confidence level is the fact that I hope to God we don't have another Macondo, and the fact that -- so that the inefficiencies that came overseas because of Macondo has been absorbed. And because the number of new deepwater rigs as being added is higher this year than it was in 2010.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "And if I could add just one more question directed to Simon. You gave us a 2011 tax rate guidance. I wondered if you could give us a sense, and just kind of rough estimate of what the pro forma tax rate for Schlumberger would've been if you would own Smith for the entirety of 2010? The question is really, mid 20s, it seems like you're kind of expecting North America contribution to be at or maybe even slightly above what it was in 2010, which doesn't seem to be consistent with the other commentary. But I don't have a pro forma for the combination with Smith.", "Simon Ayat", "Geoff, I don't think you can conclude on our growth rates from a tax rate. But to answer your question obviously, if we had Smith for the whole year, it will be higher because the Smith is a US-based source income. We do see the mix, I mean, as you know, the U.S. source income during 2010 increased gradually. So in 2011, we'll continue at the same pace, and obviously, that's the result of the increased effective tax rate. It's both the mix of revenues, not only from North America but other places as well and the Smith. I said it's hard to reconcile where the growth rate is coming compared to the tax rate, that is the element of Smith, yes.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co. Research", "What I was saying is we shouldn't assume that higher tax rate necessarily means higher North American contributions.", "Andrew Gould", "No, because of the heritage Smith. The other thing, Geoff is that Simon will of course be gradually restructuring throughout the year in such a way that we tried to minimize the effect of the fact that Smith is a U.S. It is very difficult for him to predict exactly what the tax rate's going to be this year.", "Operator", "And our final question for today comes from Kevin Simpson with Miller Tabak.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "I guess, Andrew, I guess close with North America margins, the nice improvement in the quarter and even excluding that one-time win. But you're still below your largest competitor. Is there still more upside, do you think? And then secondarily, where do you need, because your guys are so strong in the deep gulf, need, really some normalization before you can get margins back to the mid 20s or maybe even better?", "Andrew Gould", "We still have upsides certainly through the first quarter. You are probably correct in that for us. Our margins to be considerably better than our principal competitors, we need the [indiscernible] back.", "Kevin Simpson - Miller Tabak", "And there's a little bit of your normal, whatever skepticism about sustainability in North America in the comments, as you're allocating CapEx, there's some of these bigger plays with a fairly pretty robust budget for '11. Is there a kind of a contingency for the second half that you're going to wait and see in certain areas before putting additional frac crews or directional crews into specific markets that might even cause you a little bit of share? I'm just wondering how you're handling?", "Andrew Gould", "We got caught out on the way up by our organization. And we have reorganized in such a way that we understood. We now fairly understand what we're managing and how we're managing it. And you can assume that the true test of the systems that we put in place will actually be on the downside rather than the upside. So without wanting to tell you exactly what we plan, I can tell you that we have a very robust planning system to deal with any rollover in activity in North America.", "John Olaisen - Carnegie Investment Bank AB", "So you think you have more flexibility, in terms of managing your rollover?", "Andrew Gould", "Much more. All right, on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Julie will now provide some closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Operating Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Today's call is being hosted from Rio de Janeiro where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting is being held in our Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center. Prior to Andrew's comments, Simon will first review the quarter\u2019s financial results and then Paul will provide an overview of the operational results and technical highlights. Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter EPS, excluding charges, was $0.71 per share. This is a decrease of $0.14 sequentially and an increase of $0.09 compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $0.02 of charges relating to the continuing integration of Smith and Geoservices. As we previously announced, the quarter's results when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 were adversely impacted by a number of events.", "The events included severe weather in North America  and Australia, political disturbances in the Middle East and North Africa, and the absence of the Q4 early payout of the IPM gain share project in North America, as well as the traditional surge in year-end multi-client software and other product sales. These items more than accounted for the sequential decreases in the EPS.", "This is the first quarter that we are reporting under our new group structure. As a reminder, our primary reporting was based on our 3 groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Reservoir Production. These 3 groups comprise what we will now refer to as Oilfield Services. In addition, we will report our Distribution business as a separate and distinct segment. From now on, when we refer to the results of our geographic areas, it reflects the results of all 3 of the groups, including the legacy Smith oilfield and M-I SWACO businesses. Furthermore, the results of WesternGeco are also now included in both the group and geographic results and are no longer reported separately. This is a significant change from our prior quarters that I wanted to highlight. It is also worth pointing out that the Distribution business, which predominantly North-American  centric, is not included in the geographic results. All prior period amounts that I will mention have been restated to conform to our new structure.", "Pretax operating income for Oilfield Services were $1.5 billion. This represents $240 million decrease compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield Services pretax operating margin fell 206 basis points to 17.9%. International pretax operating margins were 16.5% for the quarter. Again, the previously mentioned events were the primary drivers underlying this performance. ", "From a group perspective, Reservoir Characterization margin fell 606 basis points to 21%. As the severe weather and political disturbances significantly hampered Wireline activity, while the absence of the year-end WesternGeco market line and the SIS software sales negatively impacted margins on a sequential basis. Margins for the Drilling group improved slightly to 14.6% on strong performances from IPM Well Construction activity and the number of the acquired Smith businesses in spite of the weather and geopolitical issues. Reservoir Production margin decreased 145 basis points to 19.4% due to the absence of the year-end product sales in Artificial Lift and Completion and the Q4 early payout of the IPM gain share project, as well as the impact of the weather in North America land. Distribution contributed pretax operating income of $22 million.", "On a geographic perspective, North America had a very strong quarter, driven by Well Services activity and pricing. As a result, margin increased by 32 basis points despite the absence of the Q4 IPM gain share payout, which accounted for approximately 1.4 percentage points of margin last quarter and the lower multi-client sales. Latin America margin increased by 78 basis points to 15.7% as the revenue mix strengthened. Europe/CIS/Africa margin decreased by 6 percentage points to 12.5%. This decrease largely reflect the impact of the political disturbances in Libya and Tunisia, combined with a less favorable revenue mix in Russia and the seasonality effects in the North Sea. Middle East and Asia margins dipped slightly by 145 basis points to 21.9%. This decrease is almost entirely due to the political events in the area and the weather effects in Australia. The impact of the year-end product and software sales also contributed to the decline. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges, was 23.6% as compared to 23.1% in the fourth quarter. We still expect the ETR for the full year to be in the mid-20s, reflecting the planned mix of activity between North America and the rest of the world. We ended the quarter with $4.2 billion of cash and investment and short-term debt of $2.2 billion. Net debt was $4 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $2.6 billion at the end of last quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $844 million of stock repurchases and $769 million of CapEx. During the quarter, we repurchased 9.68 million shares at an average price of $87.18 per share.", "Additionally, we have now completed the refinancing of all of the long-term fixed-rate debt we assumed in the Smith transaction. In this regard, we repurchased $1.3 billion of notes during the quarter. This refinancing will serve to reduce our interest expense going forward. CapEx for all the Schlumberger is still expected to approach $4 billion in 2011. ", "And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. Schlumberger first quarter revenue of $8.12 billion decreased 4% sequentially, but increased 45% year-on-year. The impacts of the geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East, as well as severe weather in the U.S. and Australia impacted all 3 product groups and represented around half of the sequential decrease in total Oilfield Services revenue. ", "Looking at the product groups, Reservoir Characterization sequential revenue was severely impacted by the geopolitical events  at WesternGeco Q-Land, Testing Services and our Wireline activity the most. In addition to this, WesternGeco revenue decreased following the fourth quarter surge and multi-client sales in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico even though revenue increased in Marine due to a more favorable activity mix. SIS revenues fell sharply in all areas from seasonally lower software sales.", "Casting revenue also fell due to less product sales, lower activity in Latin America and East Asia and due to the winter slowdown in Russia. Wireline revenue was flat sequentially as strong winter activity in Canada offset the impact of the geopolitical and weather events. For the Drilling group, the sequential drop in revenue was primarily caused by the geopolitical events and excluding this impact, revenue actually increased for the group. IPM Well Construction revenue increased on strong activity growth in Iraq, Mexico and Russia. Drilling and Measurements revenue decreased from lower activity and pricing in Europe, CIS and Africa and the completion of offshore exploration project in Australia, Papua New Guinea, but this was partly offset by the return of some deep water work in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and by an increase in activity in Latin America and Russia.", "M-I SWACO show continued strong activity in North America, but overall, revenue decreased due to seasonally lower product sales, the weather in Australia and delayed projects in Europe, CIS and Africa. In Reservoir Production, revenue fell sequentially largely due to the impact of the geopolitical events in North Africa and the Middle East, and due to severe weather in the U.S. and in Australia. Excluding these impacts, the production group revenue increased as higher pricing and strong demand for Well Services technologies in North America more than offset the IPM gain share payout in North America from the prior quarter and the seasonally lower product sales in Artificial Lift and Completion Systems.", "From a geographical perspective, the Europe/CIS/Africa revenues decreased sequentially as a result of the political unrest in North Africa, a less favorable revenue mix, lower software sales in the North Sea GeoMarkets and seasonally lower activity in Russia. Middle East and Asia revenue was lower as increasing IPM activity in Iraq and shale gas activity in India were insufficient to offset the impact of geopolitical events in the Middle East, seasonally lower software and product sales and weather-related slowdown in Australia.", "In North America, excellent growth in pricing, utilization and activity in our Well Services product line resulted in double-digit sequential revenue growth, which fully offset lower WesternGeco multi-client sales, the non-recurrence of the IPM gain share payout and the impact of weather-related slowdown on land in the U.S. In Latin America, strong growth in WesternGeco and M-I SWACO activity in the Brazil GeoMarket balanced lower offshore activity and lower software sales in the Mexico and Central America GeoMarket.", "Looking at some of the highlights of the quarter, I would like to start off with WesternGeco where a number of contract awards in Marine emphasize the success of new technology, both in acquisitions and in processing. Market take off of Coil Shooting acquisition with successful completion of the survey offshore Brazil and the award of a new Coil survey in Angola were particularly notable. The opening of the Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center in Brazil will be key to the processing of the Brazil data, while centers such as the WesternGeco GeoSolutions center in Jakarta will underline other contracts that have recently been awarded. For the growth in exploration activity to come, WesternGeco is well placed through technology and footprint to make further progress in the coming quarters.", "In the Drilling group, we continued to make significant progress in terms of integration and synergies between Smith and Schlumberger products and services to the point that we now see the transaction being neutral on an earnings per share basis in Q2 2011, moving up from our previous estimate of H2 2011. In addition to revenue synergies related to our global footprint, as well as our IPM and D&M businesses, we are also starting to see the first examples of revenue synergies related to new product development. As a result, Smith Bits continues to perform very well, keeping its leadership position in the  roller-cone market while at the same time dramatically improving the PBT  market share, both in international and North American markets. This position is further strengthened by the introduction of the new Spear bits that's bringing superior performance to our customers operating any unconventional shale basins. We have also recently introduced another new bit, based on our unique single-copper technology developed by our nominal drill division in Utah, which has shown up to 80% improvement in drilling rates as well significant reductions in shock and vibration. ", "At our Investor Conference in February, we discussed the new HiWAY fracture stimulation technology, and this service continues to see very rapid growth. Total job count is now approaching 1,000 with 528 stages completed in the first quarter of 2011 compared to 102 in the fourth quarter of 2010. The first horizontal open hole well in the Bakken Shale with a total of 19 stages has been successfully completed using HiWAY and the first job has also been conducted in the Middle East. A significant number of opportunities for future jobs are now under evaluation for HiWAY. A new field for HiWAY technology deployment are under discussion in the U.S. and in Canada, Argentina, India, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria, Congo and Angola.", "In the investor conference, we also told you about the leading position Schlumberger has established in well intervention and production enhancements to our market leading Wireline, slickline and coiled tubing offering. We are currently seeing particularly strong growth in our new coiled tubing service ACTive, which offers real time fiber optic enabled measurements and this new service has already been deployed to 20 GeoMarkets around the world. ", "Finally, I would like to highlight IPM's outstanding drilling performance on the well construction project in Iraq. All the projects have been mobilized and started on schedule in a very challenging environment, and we are now drilling both for BP and ExxonMobil. On the BP project, we have already managed to half the drilling time from the first well we drilled through the use of both technology and process optimization, and our ability to consistently redefine the benchmark for this performance is being recognized by our customers. ", "With that, I will pass the call over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould", "Thank you, Paal. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Despite the difficult working environment, I'm very pleased to the performance with both our North American and international operations during the quarter where a number of underlying trends were positive. ", "Wireline growth was encouraging, particularly for high technology services. Despite the seasonal drop in Russia with M-I SWACO, the Drilling group revenue increased to excellent performance at IPM Well Construction, particularly in Iraq. In addition, growth in revenue synergies with Smith and Geoservices products is very strong. Reservoir production continued to make gains in North America in both activity and pricing, which in our total North American results more than compensated for the absence of a gain share project that was recognized in the fourth quarter and a 42% drop in seismic revenues between the fourth and first quarters. These positive effects limited the decrease in margins to 206 basis points, led by strong performance in a number of GeoMarkets, including Iraq, where we achieved double-digit margins that we expect to improve continuously through the end of the year.", "Looking ahead, the recent completion or announcement of various licensing rounds around the world will ensure sustained marine seismic activity. The anticipated increases in exploration budget and the advent of additional development activity, particularly in the Middle East and North America, will rapidly improve business conditions for Wireline and Testing Services. The continued success of new Petrel releases, particularly for exploration, will ensure further strong performance from SIS. ", "For Drilling and Measurements however, despite strong increases in demand, service pricing remains extremely competitive internationally but excellent service quality and advanced technology allows this effect to be offset to some degree. In addition, call-out services are non-contracted rates have boosted this effect and further activity increases later in the year should lead to considerable tightening of capacity with a consequent effects on price impact. ", "The absence of oil production from Libya, combined with continued recovery in demand, has reduced the world's spare capacity of oil production significantly. The call on both fuel oil and natural gas will increase as Japan recovers. The exploration and production industry has begun to respond and absent a further leg to the recession, will have to substantially increase investment to maintain a comfortable supply cushion in an era of political uncertainty. We anticipate that high oil prices will continue to support additional drilling in the liquid-rich plays in North America. The upturn in deepwater activity more generally is becoming increasingly visible, and the rate of permitting in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is accelerating. Middle East activity is increasing substantially, led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq. ", "These activities will progressively mobilize over the next 6 months and the projected increases will reach levels where some resources will become constrained. Schlumberger is ready for this scenario with new technology, equipment and people. Our excellence in execution initiatives, which were introduced in 2007, is already paying dividends and will continue to do so.", "Thank you very much. I will now hand the call to Stacy for the question-and-answer session. Stacy?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will go to the line of Dan Boyd with Goldman Sachs.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Andrew, I'd like to just follow up with you on what's going on in North America and you alluded to this somewhat in your comments with the seismic being down, IPM gaining up being there this quarter. But what are you seeing, especially on land, as underlying sort of revenue and margin trends? Just as we look at what 1 of your competitors put up so far, the numbers look like they maybe growing a little bit faster. So maybe can you talk about what you're seeing there and just update us on your strategy of closing the gap in terms of, I think, size and margin within North America.", "Andrew Gould", "Okay, Dan. So can we make an extraction  of the gain for the IPM project that was sold in Q4 and an extraction  for a sequential drop of 43% in seismic revenue. And then I'm going to ask Paal to talk about the rest of our strategy in North America. Is that okay?", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That would be great.", "Andrew Gould", "Okay. Paal?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay, so if you look at what we set out to do about some months ago, we set up the goal to basically close the margin gap in North America because at that stage we were severely underperforming in our eyes. So if you look at where we stand at this stage, we have more or less closed the gap, so I'm very pleased with the margin momentum that we have managed to create. And I'm also quite confident and positive in my outlook of our future margin momentum. If you look at land, we are at this stage seeing a very strong pricing momentum in both Drilling and Wireline, and I think this will continue in the coming quarters. I also think that our HiWAY introduction drilling technology is going to help extend our pressure pumping margin momentum. We're actually seeing some customers switching to our pressure pumping services at this stage at the back of HiWAY. We also continue to drive utilization in all segments as part of the restructuring that we have initiated and we have record utilization again in pressure pumping in March. And also see some impacts that still come from the restructuring in terms of supply chain services, as well as general support. Now in addition to that, we are also relatively optimistic on the onset of the Gulf of Mexico coming back and we have a very strong position in the high-end services, so Wireline and Drilling and Measurements in these new rigs and permits that have been granted. And this, of course, is going to be highly accretive to our non-performance going forward. So that's on the margin side. On the growth, we are very much committed to invest in capacity as we go forward. The quarter-to-quarter growth for Well Services as I indicated in my comments were in double-digits, but they were offset by the significant reduction in multi-client sales, as well as the non-recurring gain share we had then in IPM. So we are very much, I would say, positive on the outlook of North America at this stage. We have secured manufacturing capacity on pressure pumping in a multi-year bid program that we started last year and we have a lot of flexibility in our program to continue to take significant capacity addition, which is what we are going to do.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That's very helpful. There's a lot I could probably follow up on with that, but let me just go back to the HiWAY and it's something you talked about at your Analyst Day. But how quickly can you build that up and is that something where we could expect you to start pulling through a lot more services and using that to lead with a differentiator? But in terms of scale and how many pressure pumping jobs or how many fleets you could roll it out to, how should we think about the progress that has been made and how quickly that could continue to ramp up?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think we are ramping this up very quickly as you see. There's somewhat the quotations that's needed to be done on the pressure pumping equipment that we have on the wildcard, but this is not significant. So the main thing is just to have the product available to pump and we have, obviously, a significant supply line set up to do this, right? So just in terms of the ramp, we did about 100 stages as I said in Q4 and we did over 500 in Q1. And this is now multiplying almost by the day, right? So we have not only in North America, but we are now engaged in looking at candidates and projects pretty much all over the globe. So this is a significant amount, I would say, growth vehicle for us on pressure pumping. And as I said, even in North America, we've had cases where customers have switched to our pressure pumping services in the background  of HiWAY.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. And if I could just have 1 more follow up on just the Gulf of Mexico coming back because that's something that Andrew highlighted at the Analyst Day of something we could -- the 1 upside surprise to really tighten even international market, it sounds like you're optimistic there, but is that something that you think contributes to a much higher incremental margins in the back half of the year, just broadly in the business?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I would say so. If you look at our margins in North America historically, the Gulf of Mexico has always been highly accretive to our business. Over the past year, it has been highly dilutive so I think it's going to have a significant relative impact to our margin as we go forward.", "Daniel Boyd - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Angie Sedita from UBS.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Andrew, in your comments you mentioned that you believe some resources will be constrained as activity increases. Which product lines would you expect would be constrained first? And I would assume it would likely be in some international markets over others, could you give us a little color?", "Andrew Gould", "I think that if the Gulf of Mexico plays out, Saudi plays out. The new [indiscernible]  seem to be coming on a pretty much as we planned them, then the first place that equipment control that will show up will be Drilling and Measurements. In fact, in some places, they're showing up already which makes complete nonsense of the industry's pricing policy at this point in time.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "And on international margins, for the third quarter of 2007, we were at 18.7%. Obviously, increased in Q4 to 19.3% on seasonality and as expected declined here in Q1 to 16.5% for international margins. When you think about the second quarter, could we go back to the third quarter level for international margins at 18.7% or do you see that as a second half of 2011 event?", "Andrew Gould", "No, I will be disappointed if we don't do that in the second quarter.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then finally, there's been some commentary about performance-based contracts for Schlumberger and it's been an area that you're focusing on globally. Could you give us a little color what percentage it is of total revenues today? What could it rise to? What customers you're working for? And is there any risk that this could change the dynamics for peak international margins for the cycle?", "Andrew Gould", "I'm going to let Paal answer the question on the strategy with performance contracting.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay, so we have actually been moving our contract base, in particular, within Drilling and Measurements towards performance contract over the past couple of years. And at this stage, we have around 1/3 of our contracts for Drilling and Measurements based on performance in various forms. And this is obviously something that we will continue to push going forward. Exactly how high it will come, I can't give you an exact number on, but again, we are setting quite aggressive goals in terms moving our contracts towards this type of cycle. And the key for that is, that obviously, when you take on a performance-based contract, you need to have confidence in your ability to perform. And at this stage, we are very confident in our ability. And the reason for that is the excellent in execution program that we embarked on 4 years ago where we have basically invested heavily both on the product development side to get better performing products, but also on the operational processes and all of these elements are now paying off very, very nicely.", "Andrew Gould", "Yes, and if I can provide a little color to that Angie. In Q1, the first quarter of 2011, we replaced our competition in Drilling and Measurements on 40 jobs. They replaced us on 7. Almost all 40 we replaced them on were for service quality review. We were replaced 1 for service quality and 6 times because we didn't have the right tool available. So I was just -- a very nice point that in this international market, as drilling ramps up, quality is really going to count.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "So is there a specific customer that you're working, is this more NOCs in international oil companies or give us little color there?", "Andrew Gould", "I think it's across the board at the moment.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, great. Well, thanks, guys.", "Operator", "I'm going to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "A question to Paal or for Simon  Ayat there, you didn't highlight any of sort of magnitude of the negative headwinds in the first quarter. That's where it's somewhat unusual, Australia, North Africa, I mean we all know, this was a very unusual quarter. Could you give us not enough, with respect to North America, but with respect to international, could you help us with some kind of magnitude of the negative effect versus kind of a normalized type of core environment? I mean, we all know that there's no such thing as normalized but nevertheless, could you help us a little bit?", "Simon Ayat", "So Ole, as we announced before, this impact of geopolitical and weather, overall impacted us between $0.08 to $0.10, will probably be more on the lower end of that. And this is what happened in the first quarter, some of it is North America, it's only the weather impact of it is North America, but the rest is international. So we are in that range that we announced, partly, it's North America, but the large part of this is international because of the geopolitical and the Australia weather, the severe weather we experienced in Q1. Does this answer your question?", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. So if you look at the margin impact from there,  say your international, so would this be -- so in percentage terms, on the international margins, what would that translate into?", "Andrew Gould", "We're not going to give you a percentage, Ole, but the decremental was very high, because whether you can't cut costs and when you're evacuating a place like Libya, you have very high decremental costs. So you can assume it was a very high percentage.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Just trying to get a feel for sort of as things normalized without pricing and the way margins would be, but I think can back into it from what you've said. Second question, Andrew, I mean talking about this nonsense pricing that the industry is engaged on, I mean how much of your capacity is tied up on nonsense pricing a the moment and when do you think it will roll off?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, not a great deal. As yet, there are probably 1 or 2 fairly large contracts where to retain them we've gone through nonsense pricing. But along as those contracts are long term, we know very well within the year's time, we won't selling the technology we bid on, so there's a possibly to recover margin in this. It's very much there. It's not -- what I'm worried about is, what I'm concerned about is that we're going into a market where the demand for this service is picking up very, very rapidly, and we still see a lot of nonsense pricing out there.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Would you think that - - you've been through a few cycles, so when do you think there'll be an environment where people will realize that it's better than nothing?", "Andrew Gould", "Yes, they will realize it when it has happened in 1 or 2 cases already, when they win contracts but they can't serve it because then the customers will become upset. And once the customers become upset, if you want to provide a decent service, you have to pay for it, right? So the emphasis will shift.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Do you see a scenario where international margins could catch up with North American margins? And if so, when would that be?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, that's going to depend an awful lot on 2 things in North America. The first is the speed with which the Gulf comes back after its initial flush of permits, right? So what is the total recon in the Gulf  going to look like in 2012. And the second is, even if activity doesn't rollover, pricing rollover on land in North America because of the surge in capacity. So those 2 effects will come North America margins, they're a little bit unknown at the moment. But I think that absent the second leg to the recession or a severe drop in demand due to higher oil prices that the trend in international margins will, in the back half of this year, should accelerate. I mean as I said in my comments, more and more confident that the activity is there.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, Andrew. Finally, this 1, could you quantify what you mean when you say spare capacity in the global oil markets have heightened up significantly as a result of this? Could you just share a little bit more of your thoughts on that?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, you've lost them -- well, I mean very rough numbers you've lost 800,000 to 1 million barrels a day out of Libya, which is having to be made up by other people, which means that from the global spare capacity which you could calculate is really being around 4.5 million, 5 million barrels a day, you've lost 1 million. And I actually think that political uncertainty will add to the need to add spare capacity or to have more spare capacity available in the world. And I think oil prices are reflecting that at this point in time.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Do you see that the scenario with the shale oil could become as big a surprise as what the shale gas goes to  all of us?", "Andrew Gould", "You're going to have to define what you mean by shale oil, Ole.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Andrew Gould", "Are you talking about the Colorado...", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "On the global unconventional oil, what is the scope for that to surprise the way North America unconventional gas did over the past couple of years?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't know. I honestly don't know. I mean, we are looking at it, but I don't have a decent result. You want to say anything, Paal?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I'm thinking  -- well, I think at this stage, it is really is what is driving the sustained activity in North America, all right? But I mean we have -- some of these wells are produced for 1 or 2 years maximum, I'd say. It's still early to say how sustainable it is. But at this stage, it is looking quite promising.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much.", "Andrew Gould", "It's a light shale gas, Ole. It depends a lot on infrastructure.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "[indiscernible] completely wrong. So I'm just wondering what is the scope here that we can grow oil production significantly more than what anybody's kind of thinking about at the moment if [indiscernible].", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I don't think that you can take these reservoirs as being some form of way of replacing the Middle East or something.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Brad Handler with Credit Suisse.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Could we spend a little time on your seismic outlook, please? Very nicely optimistic. I guess what I -- maybe 1 way of asking the question is, how much of your optimism is based on the broad demand for seismic services, for Marine contract services, specifically versus kind of nice illustrations of coil shooting technology and uptick there or continued uptick. But how much of it is sort of technology driven and specifically, Schlumberger technology, just trying to parse between those 2?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So I think the main basis for optimism at this stage is the fact that we have a very, very strong technology position both on the acquisition side and on the processing side, right? So the examples we showed on Coil Shooting is obviously at the absolute high end of it, but there's also a lot of other technologies within the offering which is unique to us, right? So we are quite, I would say, upbeat and optimistic on the basis of this strong technology position. I think what's going to be the key element that's going to determine the uptick on marine pricing is going to be what's happening -- what is going to happen in the Gulf. So I'd say whether the same round  is going to go forward at the end of this year or early 2012. If that is the case, then I think there will be a significantly more multi-client acquisition activity in the Gulf, which again is going to tie up investments that are currently on third-party, and this, again will then hopefully create the pricing traction that we are looking for. I thought the counter to that is whether some of the players more and more specifically mine leading trend  they keep adding vessels to the global's pick up. But overall the technology position is, at this stage, what makes us products optimistic and upbeat on seismic.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Understand. Just a couple of -- maybe some quick follow-ups on that. So I understand the Gulf position, but I guess you have new horizons in Brazil  that you're securing some work to shoot as well, I'm sure there's more to come. Obviously, you have a number of emerging basins, can that -- I guess the suggestion is that can all soak up with capacity is today and is it a tighter sort of tighter outlook on that basis than perhaps you've even suggesting the last 6 months or is it more -- is it pretty similar?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think overseas, it is pretty similar, right? Yes, we've had these surveys planned and they were going ahead and that's good, and some of them are actually going more high-tech than what they initially thought. But I think the main doubt there is how many vessels are going to be attracted into the Gulf of Mexico as we get ready for this lease turnaround.", "Andrew Gould", "I would just add, if I may, Paal, that the awards of blocks in the Kwanza basin in Angola were all the people who've been awarded have a time-limited in which they have to shoot 2,500 square kilometers of seismic is a fairly significant event in demand over the next 18 months.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "That's very helpful. 1 last 1 quickly. Your backlog of $900 million in WesternGeco, how does that compare with a quarter ago?", "Simon Ayat", "We've slightly improved.", "Andrew Gould", "It's a slight improvement, I might say, Brad.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, very good. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "I've got a couple of quick follow-ups. First, on North America, if I think about just the changing complexion of the market with liquids and foreign capital, IOC is coming back. Does the liquids and just, call it the toolkit required to get to that resource and the operator mix shift at all? Did Schlumberger benefit disproportionately from those 2 factors, you think in terms of your opportunities for market share?", "Andrew Gould", "I would say not at this stage. I still think as you know, I said on many occasions that for both these liquid-rich plays, as well as the gas plays that longer term, the current technology is extremely wasteful and longer term that's going to shift and it's going to shift to a point where the completed zones will be pinpointed rather than being almost statistically frac-ed, but the technology is still 2 or 3 years away from that probably.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Okay. So the resource that we're after doesn't really change that underlying trend that you've been talking about for a while then?", "Andrew Gould", "No, not really. Not really. The tool set is not there yet.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Okay. Thank you, Andrew. On quickly follow up on the seismic side, Paal, your comment that sort of the technology uptake early on, if I could sort of think about exploration cycles from leasing rounds to seismic acquisition, I think the uptake rate historically was pretty slow in the sense that you had lease and then some maybe 2D and as you got more comfortable, you went to 3D, but the technology penetration seems to be occurring a lot faster in the cycle. So is it correct to say that there's in effect a double lever this time around and that exploration activity is growing very rapidly? And that you're seeing that technology penetration much sooner in the cycle?", "Andrew Gould", "Mike, I'm just going to answer that because it's a subject I really enjoy. The advent of our technology is almost redefining the way in which people will do their initial delineation after 3D. So for example, a lot of the work we're doing in Brazil, is they've made the discovery, they've identified the reservoir, but before they go into development, they want to have a really, really high resolution map of the actual reservoir from seismic. So the technology is redefining to a certain extent the way that they're applying it, applying seismic as a tool.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "And if can add, I think also in the past, you may have had options of whether you went to 2D or conventional 3D and you could still get a reasonable view of the reservoir. And with some of the reservoirs that we are chasing now below salt, there is only 1 option in some cases and that is called shooting. So in fact, the need to move to high-end technology even to get some cycle answer is a lot more significant at this stage and that's why I think the technology uptake again is going to be quicker and higher.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "That's great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And we'll go to line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "The question I have is when you look at the numbers, you had really impressive international margin performance from around 900 basis points better than your closest competitor. So with that, what dynamics are in place that could provide Schlumberger with the opportunity to increase this spread? And do these dynamics provide a unique opportunity for Schlumberger relative to your competitors?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So if you look at the margins overseas, again, similar to North America, we also are mostly very confident in our ability to basically continue to widen the margin gap that we have versus the competition. Some of the reasons for that is that we still see a significant margin upside from the Smith integration as we continue to get both the revenue synergies and the cost synergy and as we switch into the exploration phase, the value mix of our services is, I would say still significantly higher or more favorable than that of our competitor. And also given our size at this stage and the focus that we have put over the past year on internal efficiencies, there is significant cost in margin potentials from our side. So I would say that generally, the margin momentum we have overseas is significant and we will continue to pursue it and maintain a very meaningful margin gap towards our competition.", "Andrew Gould", "Kurt, we explained in Boston and I'll repeat it, that as prices go up and as projects become more and more difficult, service quality and technology become more and more important and the operator's desire to take chances diminish, and I think that's what you see happening.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Okay, great. That's all for me. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of James West with Barclays Capital.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Good morning, guys. Andrew, I had a question about the Middle East specifically. We obviously see the ramp up that's occurring in Iraq and we have improving trends in Saudi here. For your other customers in the region, are they starting to consider or starting to accelerate programs in response to this perhaps to secure service capacity?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think we've seen that yet, but I don't think it's very far away, Jim.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Okay.", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think -- I can't honestly say we've seen it yet, but I don't see it far away, James.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "But it certainly hasn't gone unrecognized what those two countries are doing, I would assume?", "Andrew Gould", "Absolutely not, no. And also the Gulf, they're reissuing permits in the Gulf. The operators all notice these things.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Understood. And then one question actually on the Gulf of Mexico, it has been a negative drag on earnings. If we assume your cost structure as it is today and your current market share -- historical market share there, how many rigs do you need running in deepwater to turn breakeven or positive from an earnings perspective in the Gulf?", "Andrew Gould", "We've never been negative in the Gulf. So we've kept most of the infrastructure in place. We do not export a bunch of equipment, so there's not a huge amount of investment and we will bring people, the skill -- the very skilled people who we\u2019ve been using overseas from the Gulf, back into the Gulf, so the actual cost structure is not going to be significantly different from what it was before. So we will -- the margin, as Paal pointed out a few minutes ago, are going to accelerate pretty rapidly.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of John David Anderson with JPMorgan.", "John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Good morning. Andrew, you probably have a good insight and mentality that anyone has seen out there, just kind of a related question of what James is asking but specifically about Manifa. Would Manifa have happened at this time it wasn't for Libya? In other words, was Manifa planning to go at this stage all along or have we seen a change in kind of the way Aramco is operating and kind of accelerating things and I guess you're saying you think it's out there, has anything kind of shift in terms of your views of the international cycle as it kind of all fits in together?", "Andrew Gould", "I'm absolutely not going to make any comments on those specific policies of Saudi Aramco. They always had the option of accelerating Manifa in the various times. In the last two years, they've slowed it down and they've accelerated it. They're now, at this point in time, it's not for me to speculate. But yes, I think that the absence of good production worries  the oil producers generally because while they like a high-level price, you don't like a higher oil price because of they potential they have to destroy demand. So where we see a greater activity from other NOCs, I think we probably will. And also, don't forget that this activity that's being added, we do not see that coming at the expense of the expansion of gas activity which is already taking place in the Middle East.", "John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So is it fair to say you're incrementally more positive on terms of the timing of the international spend than you were 90 days ago?", "Andrew Gould", "I have a great deal more of comfort that is -- well, firstly, I'm more confident it's happening because we can see what's being built, what's being mobilized and the rest of it. And given the geopolitical circumstances, the condition of Libya and Japan and everything else, yes, I think that I'm much more confident that the international spend are going to come much faster.", "John Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And also, Andrew, in your release you talked about exploration spending ticking up and we're starting to see it pretty well distributed globally. I was wondering if you could just kind of provide some context as you should see how exploration versus development spending evolves over the next couple of years compared to last cycle? In other words, if you look out the next kind of 12 months, how does that kind of spending makes up exploration? Where does that compare? Are we looking kind of like '05, '06 and how that ramped up, how are you thinking about that as you look out?", "Andrew Gould", "I think the biggest -- there are two significant changes in the way the exploration might occur in this cycle. The first is obviously the availability of deepwater rigs and the relative increase in our knowledge of how to prospect in deepwater compared to 5 or 6 years ago, that's 1. And the second is, the national oil companies themselves coming back to exploration which is not something that they did on any scale in the previous cycles. So generally and if you look at a basket of oil companies, private ones, the reserves in production ratios are not great. Where they have acreage is going to be perspective with these oil  prices, I think they will substantially increase their exploration spend and you're seeing one or two of them out there.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Sticking with the Middle East, Asia-Pacific region here quickly. Andrew, back in '05, '06, '07, we had sort of annualized revenue growth of 20% to 30%, almost hard to believe that now. I mean, clearly, you were coming from the smaller base, you were in the midst of Saudi tripling its rig count. But based upon the broad and building swell that you're seeing right now in the Middle East, do we get back to those kind of annualized revenue growth rates, do you think?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, first, you have to remember the biggest change between now and then is we have Smith. And we have the opportunity to expand both Smith and M-I SWACO in those regions that we did not have in the previous cycle. Activity wise, I don't think -- I still don't think it's going to ramp as fast as it did in '05, '06 because the tripling of the rig count in Saudi was sort of once in 100 year event almost overseas because overseas never normally go that far. But over time, can we double some of them in the Asia again? Yes, I think we can.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Okay. Secondly, with regard to Drilling and Measurement, sort of performance-based contracts, I'm curious as to how your appetite for performance-based contracts, Paal, will shift in the event we get the supply-demand framework for D&M tightening and pricing improving demonstrably relative to the supercompetitive environment today. Does that lessen your appetite for performance-based pricing and improving overall pricing environment or is it still sort of a strategy of your irrespective of pricing where you want more performance-based  contracts?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I don't think the pricing of capacity necessarily is going to change our strategy on that. I think the benefit of this model is that we have the ability to set ourselves apart from the competition due to the stronger performance that we have and obviously, if there's a tightening of capacity and the base prices continue to go up. They will have to be a higher value for the performance that we put up. But the contractual framework very much holds water  in a tighter capacity situation as well. We will continue to push that and make sure that we get our fair share of the value that we create with our customers.", "William Herbert - Simmons", "Now I'm sure it varies by contract and by customer, but remind us basically the framework of how performance-based pricing works. What's the base pricing, if you will? Is it at a discount to what you would otherwise charge in a standard contract? And clearly, you're going to get something above and beyond what you would get on a standardized basis in the event that you deliver on the performance, but remind us the framework, if you will, as to how the performance-based pricing works.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "What you said is pretty much the case. These things vary significantly and in terms of how you formulate it in the various contracts and the various customers. But the principle is, that there is a basic fee that we get for being there and doing the work and that could typically be lower than what normal pricing would be. But then there is a similar upside for us to harvest in the event that we outperform what is currently perceived to be the benchmark and the benchmark would be the average performance of I would say us and the various competitors. So exactly how you're formulating contracts  varies somewhat, but that's the basic principle. And by having that basic principle is just a matter of how much you put on the basic fee and how much you put on the performance upside. And at the end of the day, for us to deploy equipment into these types of contracts for customers in a tightening market, it would have to be attractive.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Mike Urban with Deutsche Bank.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG", "Andrew or Paal, you talked about the tightening you see in pricing, I guess, initially in the Drilling and Measurements. Is that -- given the increase visibility that you've seen, was that something you felt was going to be happening anyway as we progressed here or is that been more a function of Saudi coming back into the market in terms of your view?", "Andrew Gould", "One more time, I always thought I may have been wrong but D&M will be the segment that tightens first partly because they lose a lot of equipment. And so if you have an increase in activity and the normal rate of equipment lasted, things tend to tighten very fast unless industry is completely overbuilt. Now the Gulf of Mexico and Saudi Arabia are both very heavy users of D&M equipment. So those events have probably given us confidence that pricing is going to come back soon.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I agree. You said year-end early on and I think it will definitely by year-end, if not, the second half of the year.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. And then after D&M, where would we progress in terms of the tightening cycle in pricing?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think the next segment that we would see that in will be in more slightly open-hole  Wireline. That's the next in line for that. So probably similar tougher times, maybe slightly off in Drilling and Measurements  but very quickly Wireline as well.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then where do you have -- conversely, where do you have the most excess capacity in the industry? What would be last to tighten?", "Andrew Gould", "Sorry, again?", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG", "What would be the last? Where should we see -- expect to see the pricing lagging?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't -- it's very difficult to say. That will depend an awful lot on how capacity evolves in North America, whether we overbuild or we don't overbuild.", "Michael Urban - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, got you. That's all for me. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have time for one last question. And we'll go to the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Andrew, you've mentioned a couple of times now that either you've replaced one of your competitors on several contracts or that as you anticipate perhaps doing it in the future given their inability to deliver on contracts. I'm just curious when you're replacing some on these contracts, are you doing it -- so not only getting the volume pickup, but are you doing it typically at a higher price in what the competitor was doing that work for?", "Andrew Gould", "We are not an insurance policy for our competitors. In other words, if we replace them, we do not agree to the contractual terms that they accepted to get the job. If we accept to replace them at their contract value, we're just an insurance policy.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay, sure. So there is some an embedded pricing improvement, I guess, in that. And then just one follow-up...", "Andrew Gould", "Paal wants to say something.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, as we decide to take on someone else's contract whether that's for 1 well or 2 wells or whatever it is, we'd obviously look at the value of that contract and whether it's something that we do want to take on. So it would have to be attractive again for us to do it and increasingly so when our competition keeps bidding low and our customers want us to come in that amount [ph].", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Sure. Just as we look for the quarter 2 here, can you give some just sense in terms of -- you had almost a 10% drop in your revenues in first quarter from fourth quarter. Just I know we had seasonal issues clearly that were addressed, but can we just talk a little bit about top line recovery here as we kind of look out the next couple of quarters and maybe how you think -- you guys think about as a whole year-over-year growth perhaps 2011 versus 2010 given what's going on in North Africa?", "Andrew Gould", "So the bulk of the revenue drop outside North America was either seasonal or geopolitical. So obviously, Libya is not coming back, right? The rest of it probably will. And the mobilization of projects towards the end of the quarter offshore was quite high. So second quarter, can we recover what we lost compared to Q4, for example? I don't think we're going to be very far away.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Okay. Thanks Andrew and Paal for your time.", "Malcolm Theobald", "In closing, I would like to thank Robert Bergeron for his support during his time as Manager for Investor Relation and wish him luck in his next assignment. And now on behalf of the Schlumberger Management Team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. And Stacy will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call, which is being hosted from London, are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Operating Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's comments, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results, then Paal will provide an overview of the operational results and technical highlights. However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges, was $0.87 per share. This is an increase of $0.16 sequentially and $0.19 compared to the same quarter of last year. ", "During the quarter, we recorded $0.05 of charges relating to our donation to the Schlumberger Foundation, as well as the continuing integration of Smith and Geoservices. We also recorded a gain of $0.16 per share in discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of our global connectivity Services business. ", "Pretax operating income for Oilfield Services, which as a reminder now includes all 3 of our product groups was $1.75 billion. This represents a $295 million sequential increase. Oilfield Services pretax operating income margin improved 155 basis points to 19.5%. ", "Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by products were as follows: Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.46 billion was 12% higher sequentially and increased 7% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $602 million was 31% higher sequentially and increased 9% year-on-year. ", "Revenue increased sequentially due mainly to higher WesternGeco Marine proprietary surveys and multiclient sales, and to greater Wireline exploration activity, with a partial recovery from the previous quarter's exceptional weather and geopolitical events. ", "Increased Schlumberger information solution, SIS software sales also contributed to this performance. ", "Pretax margin improved 348 basis points sequentially to 24.5%, led by improved WesternGeco Marine utilization, strong Wireline activity and increased software revenue. Drilling Group, second quarter revenue of $3.46 billion was 8% higher sequentially and 127% higher year-on-year. Drilling Group revenue increased sequentially on higher M-I SWACO sales and service activity, and a stronger Drilling & Measurements technology penetration increased pricing and improved job count. Among the drilling technology's sequential increases were boosted by Bits & Advanced Technologies, Drilling Tools & Remedial and PathFinder, as these former Smith product lines provided platform for growth, as drilling intensity and the complexity continue to increase. ", "Margin for the Drilling Group increased by 98 basis points to 15.6%, primarily due to a very strong performance by M-I SWACO and increased Drilling & Measurements activity. ", "Second quarter Reservoir Production revenue of $3.06 billion increased 13% sequentially and 47% year-on-year. Pretax operating income of $613 million was 16% higher sequentially and increased 146% against last year. ", "Revenue increased sequentially on higher pricing, significant capacity addition and improved asset utilization for Well Services in North America, but this increase was partially reduced by the effects of the prolonged spring break-up in Canada and adverse weather in the Williston Basin. Internationally, Middle East and Asia revenue grew on Well Services sales, higher stimulation vessel pricing and a stronger activity. Artificial Lift and Completion Systems sales also grew robustly in the second quarter, particularly in Latin America. There's a lot of production margin increased slightly by 57 basis points to 20%, as we experienced revenue improvement across all technologies. ", "The Distribution business contributed a pretax operating income of $24 million. ", "Turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges was 24.8% as compared to 23.6% in the first quarter. We still expect the ETR for the full year to be in the mid-20s, reflecting the anticipated mix of activity. ", "We ended the quarter with $5.3 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of $3.3 billion. Net debt was $4.3 billion at the end of the quarter as compared to $4 billion at the end of the last quarter. ", "Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $707 million of stock purchases, $931 million of CapEx and $385 million of proceeds from the divestiture of the Global Connectivity Services business. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average price of $86.27 per share. CapEx for all Schlumberger is now expected to approach $4.2 billion in 2011. And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Oilfield Services second quarter revenue of $8.99 billion grew 11% sequentially and 51% year-on-year. North America had another strong quarter with 11% sequential growth, while margins were up 53 basis points, including the impact of a severe spring break-up in Canada. ", "Excluding Canada, U.S. sequential revenue growth was 21% while sequential margins were up 287 basis points. These results were driven by both strong pressure pumping and drilling activity. ", "In Well Services we have, so far this year, added more hydraulic horsepower than in any previous full year. Over the past quarter, we have also made further investments in supply chain and infrastructure in support of these horsepower additions. These investments will further benefit our operating margins in the coming quarters. All our drilling technologies showed strong growth and margin performance, including Drilling & Measurements, PathFinder, M-I SWACO and the former Smith Bits and Smith Services. ", "In the Gulf of Mexico, all our deepwater startups were conducted flawlessly, and we also started a new multiclient seismic survey using our latest Dual Coil Shooting technology. ", "Pricing continued to strengthen in all groups in North America, with pricing momentum now being led by our Drilling and Wireline segments. In the international markets, revenue grew 11% sequentially, while margins were up 230 basis points to 18.5%, driven by strong performance in all operating areas. ", "In Latin America, revenue grew 14% sequentially and margins were up 228 basis points based on strong results in Brazil, Venezuela and Columbia. During the quarter, we also saw a significant ramp-up in the number of offshore rigs in Mexico. ", "In terms of technology, the sequential performance was led by strong exploration activity for WesternGeco and Drilling & Measurements and strong sales in M-I SWACO and SIS software products. ", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew 8% sequentially, while margins were up 155 basis points. The results were negatively impacted by our Libya business being shut down for the entire quarter, while we continue to pay our local Libyan employees. ", "Good progress was made in Algeria where our rig JV, Sahara, now has all rigs operating. ", "In Sub-Sahara Africa, growth of Guinea exploration remains strong while we are seeing a temporary slowdown in exploration activity in East Africa, which will pick up again in Q4. ", "North Sea activity was steady, with good exploration activity in both Norway and the U.K. and with startup of the Greenland exploration campaign towards the end of the quarter. ", "Middle East and Asia recorded sequential revenue growth of 12% while margins were up 300 basis points. The results were led by strong activity in the Saudi Arabia, Iraq and East Asia, while we also saw a positive impact on several countries as we recovered from the geopolitical and weather events of the previous quarter. ", "In Saudi Arabia, the announced ramp up in activity is progressing on schedule and will continue in the second half of the year. ", "In Iraq, our position continue to strengthen during the quarter in terms of capacity and infrastructure. All projects we are involved in are progressing on plan and we continue to set new drilling records in our IPM Well Construction operations. ", "In the second quarter, Iraq revenue was already north of $100 million, and exit margins were approaching the average of our Middle East and Asia operating area. ", "Let me then turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. The Smith integration continues to progress very well, both in terms of revenue and cost synergies to the point that the transaction this quarter was accretive on an earnings-per-share basis. The results from the Smith segments are driven by the strong position in North America, as well as the rapid expansion of their offering to the international markets, supported by Schlumberger's footprint and infrastructure. The integration of complementary Smith and Schlumberger technologies continues to improve drilling performance for our customers, with the combination of the new PowerDrive Archer rotary-steerable-system and tailor-made Smith Bits, being one example that shows great results. In addition to the progress we are making with the Smith integration, we also further strengthened our drilling position in the Russian land markets this quarter, where we closed the previously announced transaction with Eurasia Drilling. This transaction significantly expands market access for our Drilling products and services to a preferred supplier agreement with one of the largest rig contractors in Western Siberia. ", "In pressure pumping, the growth of HiWAY continued in the second quarter. We have now successfully deployed this fracturing technology in all of our 4 operating areas, and the results continue to show higher production while using significantly less resources. ", "So far in 2011, more than 1,200 stages have been pumped globally, saving over 60,000 tons of proppant compared to standard fracturing techniques. In North America, more than 700 stages were pumped in the second quarter and a total of 15 customers have now deployed the technology. ", "In Reservoir Characterization, our shale reservoir modeling workflow continues to gain traction, both internationally and in North America. This workflow uses seismic logs and cores to establish a subsurface model that is able to predict the variations in shale reservoir quality. This enables our customers to only drill wells in the best part of the shale, and only fracture the parts of the horizontal section with real production potential. This way they can significantly reduce the wasted drilling and completion costs from the brute force approach currently used in the shale developments. ", "In seismic, we are seeing continued growth in worldwide activity and we believe that this will lead to pricing gains in the second half of this year, as previously predicted. In support of our seismic business, we recently opened a new WesternGeco manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia. This brings the capacity needed to expand deployment of our marine streamers and land systems. ", "160 fully trained people are already active in the new center that was operational only 9 months after the project was launched. ", "That concludes my remarks, and I now hand the call over to Andrew.", "Andrew Gould", "Thank you, Paal, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter results showed strong growth worldwide. All product groups grew at double-digit rates. In North America, a prolonged Canadian spring break-up and cool weather in the northwest were offset by very strong growth in the rest of U.S. land and a significant contribution from deepwater operations as rig count increased, and renewed exploration activity in the Gulf of Mexico led to better multiclient seismic data sales. ", "Internationally, the trend towards higher deepwater rig counts and higher exploration spending continued. This activity was coupled with a surge in developments and work over activities, producers moved to compensate for reduced Libya barrels and to profit from higher prices. As a result, all groups had standout product lines in the quarter and technology sales showed good progress. Strong advances were made in all technologies linked to deepwater exploration and complex development drilling, including WesternGeco, Drilling & Measurements, M-I SWACO and open-hole Wireline as well as Testing Services. The Drilling Group continued to record strong synergistic revenue with a legacy Smith Bits and Drilling Tool businesses in many areas of the world. ", "The Reservoir Production, in addition to the strong North American stimulation market, high growth rates were experienced internationally as operators moved to improve production and to test unconventional gas plays in several markets. ", "Pricing power in North America pressure pumping remained robust. But more importantly, towards the end of the quarter, it became clear that pricing traction for certain other services, particularly those related to Drilling high-risk deepwater plays or other complex developments, was in place both in North America and internationally. This is not yet universal, but a positive trend is in place which should yield results by the end of the year. ", "In our second quarter outlook, we outlined the key constituents of supply and demand for oil and gas over the next few years and pointed out that absent a further length of the recession, substantial increases in investment will be necessary to maintain an adequate supply cushion in an area of political uncertainty. We anticipated that the international supply response would progressively ramp up over the second half of 2011. It transpired that the international ramp-up made a strong start in the second quarter that will continue through the rest of the year and into 2012. ", "The continued strength in drilling liquid-rich plays in North America, coupled with an acceleration in drilling both in exploration and development internationally, will put considerable strain on the ability of the service industry to meet activity levels. While it is not unprecedented that the North American cycle has run concurrently with the increasing activity internationally, the service intensity of drilling and completing horizontal wells in liquid-rich plays and shale gas basins has introduced the new dynamic inasmuch as this activity requires far more service equipment than was traditionally used in the North American land market. As a result, the ability of the industry to supply both North American and international markets with the required equipment and people in a concurrent growth phase will be challenged. ", "Schlumberger, through our size, geographical coverage, multinational workforce, comprehensive product and service portfolio and technology capability is uniquely placed to help our customers meet these challenges worldwide. Thank you very much, and I will now hand the call over for the question-and-answer session. Greg?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question in queue will come from James West with Barclays Capital.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Andrew, you've made some pretty positive comments on Iraq to the press recently. And of course, Paal you made some very positive comments as well here in your prepared remarks. I was curious as to the trajectory of growth from today's levels that you see in the top line. And then with respect to margins, really, I was deeply impressed with the margin side there. How have you been able to improve your margin so quickly when most of your competition has really struggled in profitability in Iraq?", "Andrew Gould", "James, I'll now let Paal answer that, okay?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So on the top line, I think our outlook is very positive. I think we expect to see a continued ramp in activity throughout the rest of this year and into next year. Just to give you some context, the way it's shaping up for this year. Iraq is likely to be the seventh biggest GeoMarket in the Middle East and Asia operating area, that's out of a total of 14. And in 2012, we expect this to be #3. Now in terms of margins, like I said, the exit margins at the end of this quarter were quickly approaching the average on the Middle East and Asia operating area. And there's a couple of things that I think that are key to this. Firstly, we have been very good in picking up the right type of contracts. In the contracts we have, we have been very careful what kind of liabilities we have been prepared to take on. That meant that we didn't win some of the contracts, but the ones that we have we are quite happy with. And I think we are doing quite a good job for our customers in those as well. We've also, I think, been quite good at tailoring the amount of resources we have in-country to what we need to operate effectively. And thirdly, really the main driver that we have recently now is that we are significantly beating the initial drilling targets in terms of time for the IPM projects that we have. We have more than half the average time it takes us to drill these wells. And obviously, when you are compensated on a turnkey basis, that obviously helps drive your margins.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that's very clear and very helpful. Maybe a broader question around the Middle East as a whole. I think last quarter I asked a question, had there been a response from other countries outside of Saudi Arabia to the Saudi's ramp-up that's now clearly underway. Three months later, have you seen other countries really step up or announce plans to step up their activity.", "Andrew Gould", "We've seen plans announced. But I would argue that no, none of the other countries are executing with the speed of Saudi. So yes, it's going to come, but it's not there yet, James.", "Operator", "And the next question in queue that will come from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "So Andrew, back a few months ago, you had referenced then in varying types of questions that it would take -- it's be hard to see another type of inflection, let's say, in the international cycle relative to the '05, '08 period because you're not going to get 100 rig increment out of Saudi. The prepared comments in the press release today in some ways kind of suggests that the deflection -- inflection is now upon us. What do you expect in terms of the sustainability, this cycle? Do you think it's something that could play out over a 3 to 5-year period? And once again, let's take out the macro elements here. And then secondly, how would you characterize Schlumberger's positioning and differential positioning to benefit in this cycle compared to its peers?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I mean, I think that to the extent that the liquid-rich plays is extended in the U.S., I'm not going to comment on gas because I really don't quite understand how the gas rig count's going to work out. I think that what a pricing inflection point could be created just by the fact you have 2 concurrent cycles, one overseas and one in North America. Now the second thing, this distinguishing factor of Schlumberger is Reservoir Characterization. It was very clear in this quarter that an acceleration in the exploration cycle is such that, that is going to be a distinguishing part of the company. And if we look at the level of demand for seismic over the last few months and the global demand for seismic, coupled with some form of return in the Gulf of Mexico and there have been encouraging noises out of Washington about holding a lease sale, that makes the seismic business look a lot better than it did even 3 months ago. And the second thing is that, there have never been so many deepwater rigs on order. So to the extent that we have exploration success in deepwater, and there's no reason to believe we won't have reasonable success, I think that the exploration cycle can be a lot more sustained than it was last time when it was abruptly terminated by the financial crisis and by the Macondo incident. So I think that's the first thing. And the second thing, as I've said forever, a long, long time, ever since I took over, to renew the production base when we're close to 90 million barrels a day is just going to take a lot more CapEx than it did -- and OpEx, by the way, than it did when the world was at even 80 million. So to the extent that, as you say, if you exclude the macroeconomic risks which are not inconsiderable at this point in time, I'm back to my sort of theme of stronger for longer.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "And then I would maybe just follow up on ultimately the pricing is going to be [indiscernible] maybe again in more detail, but on the seismic front, Paal, you talked about 21% revenue growth in the U.S. market on a sequential basis. Is that just for the U.S. land business or did that 21% also include the seismic?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, that's the total. But if you look at the impact of seismic this quarter, it was not really significant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "So my first question, though, goes back to the U.S., the Gulf of Mexico. You sounded a little bit more upbeat than what I had expected when it comes to the near-term outlook for the Gulf. Could you talk a little bit about what you expect in terms of just the permitting cycle?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, we're not -- I don't think we're really that different from what other people have been saying on the permitting cycle. But the difference for us is going to be seismic, Ole, because I'm sure you saw [Michael] Bromwich's statement last week about oil -- firstly, the western Gulf which is not great lease sale being held, either at the very end of this year or the very beginning of next, and central and eastern Gulf lease sale being held in the first half of next year. And given the investment we've made in really leading-edge subsalt for multiclient surveys using a lot of our full [ph] technology, that will be very positive for us. So I think the difference is seismic.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. When it comes to the permitting, do you expect a little bit of a lull here or do you see a recovery? How do you see it panning out?", "Andrew Gould", "Paal?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. Well, if you look at the current rate, it is relatively slow. But I think as Andrew was alluding to, I think if you linked the fact that there is indications from Washington that the lease sale is going to go ahead, I think we are relatively optimistic that the permitting will speed up to make sure that the ramp-up of rig activity that we have or that we are seeing, or at least we are seeing plans of, is going to be or able to be sustained.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Andrew, on a prior call, you made a reference to announcements of pricing strategies by certain market participants, can you give us an update to what you're seeing right now?", "Andrew Gould", "I think it's slowing down. I also think that it's not -- the consequence is not as surprising as poor service quality. And last quarter, we gave a number of people that we replaced. And this quarter in our Drilling segment, we replaced our competition 47x. We were replaced 10x, and 8x out of 10x, we were replaced because of lack of equipment not service quality. So I think that the rhythm of nonsense pricing is slowing, but it's not entirely over.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Well, was it mainly your large global players that you replaced or was it situations we're, let's say, [indiscernible]?", "Andrew Gould", "No. It's mainly the large players. Mainly the large global players. Mainly the large global players, Ole.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, then. Finally, my last question, Andrew. West Africa, it seems that this year, the Russia, Europe, West Africa is a little slower than what we might have expected, almost difficult to gauge given the effect of the sale of the drilling rigs. But West African exploration, you highlighted many times that you're very optimistic about the outlook for West Africa in general, and particularly on deepwater exploration. Can you give us a little bit of an update on what you're seeing at the moment?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, we're fractionally more optimistic on Nigeria following the election. Gulf of Guinea is still very strong. We see Angola, both exploration and development, starting to increase in the second half year, and East Africa will be quite slow in the third quarter where we can see it picking up quite a lot in the fourth quarter. So it's coming. I know we've said this before, I think, but deepwater West Africa and East Africa, to a certain extent, is coming.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "And to what extent is this a function of whether there's success of results in the region or not?", "Andrew Gould", "That's irrelevant at the moment. There are 3 wells in the Kwanza this year. If any of them hits a consequential quantity of oil, then we will be revising the forecast upwards. But we -- don't forget that mostly the activity in the next 18 months will be the seismic commitment on the blocks that are awarded.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Could we please spend a little bit more time on Russia? Maybe you can help us calibrate the impact of the asset swap. And then perhaps more importantly, how should we think about sort of the second half of the year and into 2012 as opportunities should start to present themselves with Eurasia?", "Andrew Gould", "Paal?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, so at this stage we are busy integrating the additional drilling and well construction services that we got as part of this transaction, right? So there was a negative impact on revenue in the second quarter at the order of about $30 million or so, a little bit less than that. This is going to continue and gradually get lower over the second half, and we believe that we'll be on par basically in Q1 of next year. But these are not significant numbers in the overall ECA picture, right? But that's basically that we sold off the rigs and then we have to basically get the services integrated before they start having an impact. But we are very positive on the overall activity in Western Siberia, and also the fact that we now have access with the preferred supplier agreement on one of the biggest rig contractors in the market. It's going to give us a significant -- a bigger footprint for the products and services that we had at Schlumberger and they'll be added with Smith, and that we also now add with the Eurasia deal. So I think overall, the outlook on Russia, we are quite bullish on.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Fair enough. Just to stick with the idea, a couple of directions maybe. First, do you anticipate that a lot of it will be done -- a lot of the work won and then executed will be done on some sort of long-term contract basis? Does the nature of the work change, even Western Siberia in some way? And then maybe the second question is how important is the idea of pulling through sort of higher-end services into the mix?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well the deal we have with Eurasia is the 5-year preferred supplier agreement. And for these type of wells, there's a general type of basic work that is the standard on everything. I think it's going to be a significant opportunity to introduce and deploy higher-end technology that we use other places in the world into this as well, with the type of rigs that Eurasia are drilling also has. So I think there is an opportunity to use a very much tailor-made footprint to the Russian market and on top of that, put our high-end technology that can significantly improve efficiency.", "Andrew Gould", "And if I might just add. On the question of rigs, rig contracts. The model in Russia is of a general contractor. And to the extent that Eurasia can do it, I think that the contracts will be more and more denominated in numbers of wells. So the average duration is likely to extend, compared to what it's been in recent years.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "That was sort of what I was trying to get out, I just didn't ask the question very clearly. I was trying to get at this idea of them owning and controlling a little bit more of the operations, which I suppose feeds both longer work and technology.", "Andrew Gould", "The rig is the general contractor, you're quite right, Brad.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Right, so might that become more visible or more public as a result if we're [indiscernible].", "Andrew Gould", "I very much doubt it. I mean, when you say more public, you're referring to -- make sure that the rig count in Western Siberia is, to say the least, a difficult thing to account for.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Fair enough. If I may, an unrelated follow-up. Smith integration has clearly gone consistently better than you were sort of forecasting prior, right? But as we think about purely from a cost savings and a cost integration basis, is there more to come on that score?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "If you look at the overall deal, it was primarily a revenue synergy deal, right? There were just some opportunity to reduce costs linked to corporate structure, supply chain and some of the supporting infrastructure. So we are on track with the costs during this year. There's more cost to come obviously in the second half of the year into next year. But I think the overshadowing part of the, I would say overperformance here is down to the revenue synergies. And that's partly down to the technical synergies of bringing together all parts of the BHA, but also that we are able to relatively quickly transport a lot of the Smith portfolio into the international markets and gain share there relatively quickly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JP Morgan.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "Andrew, I love asking a big picture question, so I guess I'll take my last opportunity here. I guess there's some debate out there just with the IEA oil release event activity levels in both the near term and the long term out there. But I get the sense it hasn't really had any impact on Saudi's near-term plans. I was just wondering if it gave any of your IOC customers any pause regarding the direction of oil prices, or is this totally irrelevant, and really the real message out there to the market is very bullish and that the developed countries really don't have the confidence that OPEC's true x [ph] has capacity there?", "Andrew Gould", "I would go with your last analysis. I think it was a meaningless exercise. I heard some really strange explanations as to why it was actually done. But the underlying signal that went to everybody was that the developed nations are worried about the availability of supply, long term. And to think that, that quantity of product could really make a difference to the oil price I think was very -- a little bit of a panicky move.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "So from your advantage, was there any NOC reaction to this at all? Or is it just kind of business as usual and they effectively ignored it?", "Andrew Gould", "I think they effectively ignored it.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "Okay. On a different subject, the Reservoir Characterization group showed some very strong sequential margin improvement. However, North American region didn't. And I get a good part of that was Canada. But at the same time, in WesternGeco was said that they're the big contributor from the Gulf. Would have thought that Geco margins would have shown a fairly big margin improvement this quarter? Was that the case? Because we don't have the visibility there anymore.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Sorry, let me get it. The multiclient in the Gulf was better than what we'd normally expect in the second quarter of the year. It was not a huge contributor to the sequential growth in North America. But what was significant was multiclient was a significant contributor higher than normally in the second quarter in other parts of the world, Australia, North Sea, West Africa. So there was a much higher level of international multiclient than we normally would expect in the second quarter of the year. But it was not a defining fact in North America progression. It was just a nice to have.", "David Anderson - Palo Alto Investors", "Okay, understood. Your customer base on the multiclient, internationally, I think it's always been kind of a little bit more on the independent side on the U.S., how does that change internationally, in terms of kind of who that customer mix is?", "Andrew Gould", "I think the larger players -- actually, by the way, I think that the argument that multiclient is purely an independent business is being somewhat weakened through the fact that a lot of the multiclient we do, we employ totally unique technologies. And therefore, we have IOC buyers just as much as we have independent buyers. Now generally overseas, I would say that pretty much everyone buys multiclient. It's not just the independent. The question in the overseas is normally the block sizes are so big, the number of players is much smaller and therefore, it's much harder to choose a multiclient target survey that's going to have general appeal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "On seismic, Paal, I guess a question for you. If I think about the market getting tighter, pricing getting better, I guess 2 questions. One, within the context of pricing getting better, how much of that do you think is really the technology versus just industry inflation and tightness of utilization. And then I guess secondly is a follow-on to Andrew's comment that perhaps the multiclient outlook looks a little bit better than we thought 3 or 4 months ago. Does it change anything on the capital side in terms of converting gunboats back into streamers or even adding vessels?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay, on the first question which is you're asking how much is done through technology and how much is just straight capacity? I think on the technology side, we are obviously using a significant amount of our technology in the multiclient, and that's how we can, for sure, deploy it. So I would say that the main price driver at this stage in the market is going to be tight capacity. But also, we are seeing very good applications for our high-end technology both in the third-party market, but even more so on the multiclient. But generally, it's the capacity constraint that's going to initially drive pricing. On the capital plans, I think the main thing for us is that in the Marine seismic gain, utilization is everything. So we are currently running at very good utilization and that's the key driver for our profitability. So if we see opportunities to add or reconvert back streamer vessels that are currently used as source boats and maintain our utilization well into the 90s, we will do that. But we will be opportunistic on that and look at doing that at the right time. But we have clearly the capacity to do that whenever we choose to.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "So it's premature, relative to your thoughts back at the Analyst Meeting in February to say that the seismic market has gotten to the point where you would consider that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think we are looking at this on a monthly or quarterly basis, right? So I would say that the first thing now is that you need to get supply to meet demand, and we are getting close to doing that in terms of 3D vessels. When that is getting close, we have built in capacity to our fleet to at least handle a capacity addition for another year before we need to look at new builds and so forth.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Okay, great. And then last one for me. Andrew, if I think about international growth, you mentioned exploration activity obviously and sort of simultaneous development. A lot of exploration is offshore. The onshore conventional side -- or rather the onshore side, how much do you think the unconventional is going to contribute to growth over the next 2 to 3 years on the onshore side?", "Andrew Gould", "Across the global international CapEx budget, I think the contribution -- did you mean by unconventional, shale?", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Yes.", "Andrew Gould", "As opposed to tight...", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "As opposed to, well, let's call it all unconventional, because I know CBM is a big piece as well. So tight CBM and shale...", "Andrew Gould", "Then I think the countries where it's going to happen are limited. So China, Poland, Argentina, Australia, maybe a little bit of India, I don't know. It's not on the scale of the complete international CapEx budget enough to move the needle. Now what it is, Michael, is what I tried to point out in the commentary, is where it does happen, it absorbs a huge amount of equipment. So, I mean, I don't think in the next 2 or 3 years it's enough to shift the needle. Particularly as overseas as Paal explained in his comments, they cannot take a statistical approach to it. They have to do some qualification of the reservoir, because they don't have the same knowledge of the shale, however poor that may be, as you do in the U.S.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "So science first, a lot of Reservoir Characterization work?", "Andrew Gould", "Well I think they have to, yes. They have to do it. They can't do it any other way. I mean, that's very obviously the case in Poland, for example.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC", "Right. So having about Schlumberger impact on Schlumberger, the Reservoir Characterization side, the geoscience side, it's going to show up before, really, the rig volume starts to show up?", "Andrew Gould", "Yes. I shall be watching with interest as they implement the characterization workflow, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Andrew, on the international pricing. For the inflection to truly be upon us or to be universal as you stated in your press release, do you think that we need to see both the end of nonsense or nonsensical pricing and greater evidence of tangible activity growth in both West Africa and Southeast Asia?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Angie as activity goes up, customers become more and more concerned about the quality of service delivery and less and less concerned about the cost. This is why technology sales are improving right now. So I think that you don't have to wait for an inflection point to get rid of nonsense pricing. I think it's going to go away quite naturally. What was the second part of your question?", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "And then do we need to see both West Africa growth -- I mean, tangible activity growth in West Africa and Southeast Asia?", "Andrew Gould", "It's not [indiscernible]. Don't forget, the principal driver of deep water activity is still Brazil. But if you get a combination of Brazil, West Africa and a reasonable level of permits in the Gulf of Mexico and some of the projects in Australia getting sanctioned, it's going to get very tight. Yes.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes, okay. Fair enough. And then also, given the tax changes in the U.K., North Sea, what is your outlook in the region next year? Could activity be down modestly, flat or potentially more material? And then also, on that tax changes in Russia, does it imply incremental activity next year?", "Andrew Gould", "Well on Russia, I think the answer is yes, it does. And in the North Sea, this year we certainly haven't noticed any effect on activity of the tax change in the U.K. And yes, I think it could have an effect next year, but I also think that there will be considerably more longer discussions between the transfer and this sector in the oil industry before next year comes around.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "All right. And then finally, on the Framo acquisition and the purchasing of the remaining 47%. I believe Framo is the only, I guess, true competitor of SMC in subsea boosting. So what's the strategy for owning the company? And are there other complementary subsea businesses that you'd be interested in?", "Andrew Gould", "I think if you look out to Framo, we have been involved with them for over 10 years. We previously held 52% of the shares of the company and we got the opportunity to buy the remaining part, and we took the opportunity. It's obviously a very well positioned company, in terms of their leadership in subsea and boosting, which we find interesting. But beyond that, we took the opportunity to buy out the other owners.", "Angeline Sedita - UBS Investment Bank", "All right. So no other business that you're interested in, in conjunction on subsea?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Not at this stage, no.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Paal, I'm a little bit unclear with regard to the pricing commentary on seismic. You said pricing improving second half of this year, does that mean for marine contract engagements commencing next year, in terms of tendering activity taking place second half of this year or is it realized pricing?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, it will be the contract that we are bidding for. Now that could be for next season, meaning 6 or 9 months away. Or they could be 2 or 3 months away from the spot market as well. So I think we are seeing early signs -- we saw early signs now in Q2 or in some isolated market, and we believe that the bid pricing that we are submitting, that's what's going to be giving us this pricing traction in the second half of the year. And some of these bids are relatively short term, which means they could be implemented in the second half and some of them could be spilling into 2012 as well.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "And from a marine contract standpoint, where are you seeing the most pronounced vigor and appetite and sort of potential pricing inflection? Which regions?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We see strength in marine activity actually worldwide. We just have to continue into 2012. So that's the North Sea, the Bering Sea, Angola, Brazil, Asia, Australia. So it's obviously with the -- if the lease sale, when the lease sale is announced in the Gulf of Mexico, that's going to draw a significant amount of multiclient activity back into the Gulf, which there is going to give some pricing traction. But also that's going to have a spill-on effect back to the places that I just referred to.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Got it. So we shouldn't read too much into the fact that WesternGeco's backlog was actually down quarter-on-quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I wouldn't read anything into that.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. Secondly, with regard to a couple of sort of regional markets. Manifa, Paal, are you willing to share one, what the well costs are there that you are drilling? And two, where your current rig count is and what the targeted rig count is going to be?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So in terms of the well cost, I'm not able to share that. I don't have the exact number of the rig count that we own now. The main thing that is clear is that for the Manifa project, the rig counts are going up. They started to go up this quarter, they will continue to go up in the second half of the year. A significant part of the increase is going to be on the land rigs or the rigs on the causeway, yes, it's the contract that we hold. And these are the high intensity or complex ERD wells. So in that sense, our activity outlook for Saudi Arabia is very positive on that basis.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. And then lastly for me, Mexico, any updated observations here with regard to the outlook there, please?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, so on the land side, we shut down the Burgos project, as planned, in the second quarter. The IPM project, Mesozoic [indiscernible] continues with the recount that we have then are pretty stable. The production management contracts or the production incentive contracts are currently out, the 60s that are out for bid. We're going to participate and the submissions are due there in September, so that will be an interesting business model to try out in Mexico. We saw a significant ramp-up in offshore activity during the second quarter. And this is the shallow water offshore activity. And that ramp-up of rigs is actually set to continue into H2. So we're quite upbeat on the offshore part of Mexico, as well it's going to be very interesting to see how these production incentive contracts pan out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Just wanted to follow up as it relates to the revenue and margin improvement we saw sequentially in the Eastern Hemisphere 2Q. Is that mostly just a snapback as you guys see it from the seasonal declines in the first quarter? Or have we started to see some of the improving operating fundamentals really creep into the results yet, I guess, my first question? And second, given the pricing and mixing outlook, I think expectation has been kind of a back half of '11 to be more of a volume-led margin expansion story. I'm just curious if there's anything that you guys see in the Eastern Hemisphere as far as a sharper margin inflection in the back half of the year, or is that still pretty much a 2012 story.", "Andrew Gould", "I think I was quite clear in the commentary that we -- it's not general yet, but individually, on small contracts, pricing improvements have begun. And I think that I don't see any reason why that would go away now, Bill. Now there is a snapback effect partly in EMEA, of Australia and Egypt, but it's not significant in the overall picture. And yes, you have definite activity pickup. And what I would point out to you, we pointed out at the beginning, is that a lot of the pickup was in characterization, and therefore that tells you that a lot of the pickup is beginning at some of these exploration campaigns that we've been waiting for.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "And maybe just adding to that, I agree with what Andrew is saying. I think that if you look at the sequential margins overseas, there's really 2 main components, one is that the volume is actually going up. And the way we are set up with our and our infrastructure, we are actually able to leverage the volume and the fixed costs we have to generate good fall-through even on a relatively flat pricing, right? That's #1. And #2, as Andrew alluded to, the part of the company that grew very well was the Reservoir Characterization where the average margins are obviously higher than for the other 2 product groups.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated", "Sure. My one follow-up would be, given the pricing outlook here, internationally typically it's been more of a longer-term contracting type market. I'm just curious, is there an opportunity as you saw in incremental contracts, to structure these in more shorter term-type periods to generate more leverage for yourself in capturing this pricing inflection? Or is this still going to be a market dominated by longer-term contracts and that kind of uplifts based on up-selling and technology additions?", "Simon Ayat", "It's more of the latter.", "Andrew Gould", "Yes, it's more of the latter. Generally, these contracts have one fixed term and then options for our customers to take several, right? So I think the way they bid it is basically up to them and that [indiscernible]. So I think there's going to be a major change to how the contracting is done.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandall from Dahlman Rose.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC", "Andrew, I'm going to ask you to look backwards and look forwards, what are you most proud of, of your accomplishments over the last 9 years? And what do you think the biggest challenges for Paal are going forward?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think I can single out any particular achievement I'm more proud of that others. I think if I am going to single out anything, it's the quality of the management team and the depth of the management team, not just the first and second level, but even the third and fourth level that I'm leaving behind. It's a people business. And I think that Paal has -- Paal and I have been discussing this for a long time and it was quite conscious that we did the Smith acquisition 18 months before I retired, so he didn't have to worry too much about a strategic M&A for the first few years. He can just execute. And I think that given the state we're in, in the cycle, provided the economies hold together, he can -- the capacity to execute will be fundamental to the company's growth and results for the next 2 or 3 years.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC", "In past cycles, it seems to me as you look back, Andrew, one of the primary ways of improving international margins, particularly in reservoir valuation was to introduce new technology at higher price points. Do you expect that to be a driver at this cycle, and do you think that over the next 12 months that there should be a heavy period of new tool upgrades and introductions into the markets?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So as we pointed out in Boston in February, this year is a better year than last year. And so far, the key introductions that we've made this year are going good. But as we also pointed out in Boston, 2012 should be a much stronger year for new introductions than 2011. And a lot of the introductions, not necessarily all in reservoir evaluation ought to do with drilling efficiencies, and a lot of them are the results of the Smith acquisition. And in a high activity market, drilling efficiency is worth an awful lot of money to our customers so I'm quite confident that, that will play a major part in the next cycle as well.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC", "Okay. One final question, many of your big competitors are adding frac equipment in North America as quickly as they can. How would you say your equipment-adding strategy differs from them?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think it does, but I'll let Paal comment on that.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I think we, well, we generally believe that there is opportunity to bring service intensity down from this brute force approach we have to share development. We are still pursuing both sides of the equation there. And so while we continue to promote the workflow that I alluded to in my comment, we are also adding significant horsepower this year into our Pressure Pumping business. So as I mentioned in my commentary, we added in the first half of this year, more horsepower than we've done in any full year previously. And I think that just basically signals that we are part of this thing as well.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC", "And Paal, how significant do you think the whole sliding sleeve technology area will be in the business and what are Schlumberger's plans here?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we are looking at this technology as well. But I think that there's a few things that this sliding sleeve technology that I think needs to still be clarified, right? I mean, the main thing the sliding sleeve technology does is that it groups several frac stages into one larger stage. It means that all the substages of this larger stage is one hydraulic system. So what it means is that you will need more horsepower, more peak horsepower to frac this mega-stage in one go. So that's only significant for the pressure pumping company and you can also do more jobs within one unit over time. But I think that the jury is out on how the economics are going to look for our customers on this, and also what the impact on production is going to be like. So we are looking at it, but I think it is yet another thing that might add intensity to the whole equation. But I think one of the things we need to look at as an industry is to see how we can get the intensity down and be more succinct in how we pursue these things.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Jeff Keeberts [ph] from Whedon [ph].", "Unknown Analyst - ", "A couple of questions. Multiclient. What percentage over the last 12 months -- what percentage of multiclient is revenues being generated outside of the U.S.?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't know the answer off the top of my head, Jeff. Do you know it, Simon?", "Simon Ayat", "You mean over the last...", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Outside, over the last 12 months, non-Gulf of Mexico.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Let me give you a choice. 25%, 50% or 75%?", "Simon Ayat", "It's more -- it's sub-50%. For this quarter, for your information, it's more like 80%. Compared to the North America, yes? It will be 80% of the North America. At last quarter, sorry, if you look at the last quarter, just to add more information, it was 60% of the North America.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay, great. That's helpful.", "Simon Ayat", "Half the year, we are about 70%.", "John Lawrence - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. In terms of bigger picture in the international market. I think you were clear, Andrew in regards to the tone. It's gotten materially better. Can you point to anything in particular that has caused that to happen over the last 3 months?", "Andrew Gould", "In terms of the international market, Jeff?", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think just the obvious ones, like Iraq and Saudi. And then there's the less obvious ones is North Sea, which has done better, I think, than we originally thought. And then I would say that the, perhaps one of the biggest surprises is East Asia where an awful lot of activity has been directed towards improving production at higher oil prices. And frankly, it may not be the opinion of Paal, but I'm surprised -- I knew Latin America would be strong, but I'm quite surprised how strong it is, because it's not just Brazil.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. And then just to clarify in Saudi and Iraq, obviously they're strong, but are they materially stronger than what you were expecting?", "Andrew Gould", "Well, obviously, Saudi is. And of course the other thing that's really nice in Saudi is when they go into production enhancement or work over to increase production, it generates very high volumes very quickly.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. Well that was kind of my related question, as you talk about pricing leverage, a little bit of a variant on the question about seismic earlier. Is that pricing leverage that's going -- that's being reflected in contracts you're signing right now that will appear to us 2, 3 quarters from now? Or is it...", "Andrew Gould", "Yes, the question is going to be whether or not to really allow you guys to see it. In other words, as I said earlier on, it's on the small contracts, at the moment, that we get leverage, not on the big ones.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Got you. Okay. And shifting to North America, since I'm the last question I get to go for longer. What percentage of your frac horsepower is on 24/7 operations in the U.S. today?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don't have a number for you on that, but I mean we are continuing to convert the 12-hour cruise into 24 hours. But I don't have the number for you. And maybe Malcolm can come back to you.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Do you think it's anywhere close to 50%?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don't think it's 50%. It's sub-50% for sure.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And rising, though?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "And rising, yes.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "And then in terms of your comment, Paal, about the pricing momentum in the North American market is now greater for D&M and Wireline than pressure pumping. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit there that's, I think, somewhat surprising?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I would just say, I mean, it still doesn't mean that we don't have pricing momentum on pressure pumping. It's just that the other services, which is actually quite a significant part of our portfolio in North America, is starting to show some very nice contribution to the overall picture as well, in terms of moving margin and also contributing to growth. So we have a very strong position on both the drilling side, and to a certain extent on Wireline on land, but obviously, very much offshore. And these things are now starting to make significant contribution as well, in terms of the quarter-to-quarter momentum.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "If we were to just focus on the land market, would that statement still be true?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "For drilling, yes.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Greg will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:30 Central Time today through August 22.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Keely. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Joining us on the call today are Andrew Gould, Chairman; Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paul.

A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges, was $0.98 per share. This is an increase of $0.11 sequentially, and $0.28 compared to the same quarter of last year. ", "During the quarter, we recorded $0.02 of charges relating to the continuing integration of Smith and Geoservices. Pretax operating income for Oilfield Services was $1.93 billion. This represents a $182 million sequential increase. Oilfield Services pretax operating income margin improved 77 basis points to 20.2%. ", "Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.5 billion and pretax operating income of $610 million were both flat sequentially. Revenue increases in Wireline and Testing Services due to strong exploration activity were offset in large part by WesternGeco, which was significantly impacted by lower marine vessel utilization on account of seasonal transits and higher docking time, as well as the startup delays in land seismic activities in the Middle East and Asia. Pretax margins were also flat at 24.5%, as the improvements in Wireline and Testing Services due to an improved revenue mix were offset by the impact of the vessel transits and project delays in WesternGeco. ", "Drilling Group third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion were 6% higher sequentially, while pretax operating income improved by almost 14% to $613 million. The revenue increase was led by M-I SWACO on higher activities in U.S. land unconventional plays combined with increases in deepwater activity in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil for both M-I SWACO and Drilling & Measurements. Pathfinder revenue grew on U.S. land, while other technologies improved following last quarter's spring break-up in Canada. Drilling Group pretax margin improved sequentially by 111 basis points to 16.7% as a result of the higher-margin offshore activities, the seasonal rig count recovery in Canada and better pricing and operating efficiencies in IPM. ", "Third quarter Reservoir Production revenue of $3.37 billion increased 10.2% sequentially, while pretax operating income improved by 15.5% to $707 million. Revenue increased sequentially, largely due to higher Well Services activities following the spring break-up in Canada. Well Services also had a strong performances on land in the U.S., as well as in Latin America and the Europe/CIS/Africa areas. Reservoir Production pretax margin improved 1 percentage point to 21%, primarily on Well Services increases in Canada and higher asset utilization in U.S. land. ", "Revenue for the Distribution segment increased almost 10% sequentially to $698 million, and the business contributed $31 million of pretax operating income. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. It's worth noting that the results in our Europe/CIS/Africa area continue to be burdened by cost relating to the Libya geo market. These costs adversely impacted the quarter's results by just over $0.01 per share. In addition, we lost $0.02 per share on the revaluation of certain foreign currencies denominated assets and liabilities, as a result of the significant strengthening of U.S. dollar against many currencies at the very end of the quarter. The impact of the revaluation process typically does not have a significant impact on us. However, this quarter, the foreign exchange movements in September were quite extraordinary, so I wanted to highlight this to you. ", "Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges, was 23.7% as compared to 24.8% in the second quarter. The ETR for the full year is still expected to be in the mid-20s. We ended the quarter with $6.3 billion of cash and investments on hand and short-term debt of $2.7 billion. Net debt was $5.2 billion at the end of the quarter compared to $4.3 billion at the end of last quarter.", "During the quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue $1.1 billion of 5-year notes that bear interest at 1.95%, $1.6 billion of 10-year notes that bear interest at 3.3% and $300 million of 3-year floating rate notes. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included capital expenditure of $1 billion, $811 million of stock repurchases, as well as the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Framo engineering. ", "During the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares at an average price of $81.86. CapEx for the -- all of Schlumberger is still expected to approach $4.2 billion in 2011. And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. Our overall third quarter results continue to show solid progress, reflecting the trends we indicated in previous quarters. In North America, we saw strong growth on land and offshore, supported by a sequential increase in rig count and with further pricing momentum building in our Wireline and Drilling-related product lines. In the international markets, deepwater and exploration activity continue to strengthen, coinciding with a number of high-profile discoveries in several of the key basins around the world. While the international rig count continued to grow, we also saw early signs of pricing traction in our Wireline and Drilling & Measurements product lines during the quarter. ", "In North America, we had a strong quarter, with 15% sequential growth and with margins up 179 basis points. The results were driven by 3 things: first, strong seasonal growth in Canada, where the rig count currently is 31% higher than the same time last year; second, by solid growth in deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we continue to lead the market in both share and technical performance; and third, by continued growth in liquids-rich shale basins on land in the U.S. ", "The product line with the highest sequential revenue growth in North America was Wireline, driven by land and deepwater activity and further supported by continued pricing traction. Our Drilling product lines also saw strong revenue growth and pricing momentum during the quarter, driven by Pathfinder, Smith drill bits, M-I SWACO and Drilling & Measurements. ", "In pressure pumping, our completed stage count grew by more than 20% during the quarter, as we added a number of new frac fleets to the market and continue to convert crews from 12- to 24-hour operations. ", "During the quarter, pressure pumping pricing began flattening in the liquids-rich basins while we saw modest downwards pricing pressure in the gas basins. At WesternGeco, we continued shooting the Dual Coil survey in the Western Gulf of Mexico. We also started commercial trials of our new land seismic system, UniQ, in one of the U.S. shale basins. This was link to the Reservoir Characterization workflow we are introducing to the shale markets. Multiclient sales in North America remained at normal levels for the quarter. ", "Following the strong second quarter performance in the international markets, we saw a sequential growth in revenue of 2% in the third quarter, while margins contracted by 56 basis points. This is in line with a comment made in our second quarter earnings call, where we stated that international growth would not follow a straight line. Our Q3 results were also impacted by the sequential performance of WesternGeco, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. ", "In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue contracted by 4% sequentially, and margins were down 276 basis points. This was driven by WesternGeco, where we experienced significant start-up delays on several of our large land seismic projects. Multiclient sales were down sequentially, and marine revenue was also down in the region, due to dry docking of vessels and vessels transferring out of the regions as they completed their surveys. ", "Excluding WesternGeco, we still saw a sequential revenue growth in MEA driven by Iraq, Saudi Arabia and East Asia. In Iraq, we continued our strong performance in both revenue growth and margins. During the quarter, we won 3 new significant contracts that we have already started to mobilize. We are also continuing to bring the Smith product lines into the country, as well as further building our presence in Kurdistan. ", "In Saudi Arabia, the ramp-up plans for new rigs remain in place, with some limited slippage. In addition, rig-less activity in Saudi Arabia showed strong growth both in pressure pumping as well as in Wireline and intervention services. In East Asia, we saw strong growth in development activity in Malaysia, as well as higher exploration activity in Vietnam. Following the 14% sequential growth in Q2, Latin America posted 5% sequential growth in Q3, while margins contracted by 163 basis points due to changes in the revenue mix.  ", "During the quarter, Mexico posted the strongest growth, driven by higher IPM activity as well as higher offshore activity. Argentina also saw robust growth driven by shale gas activity, where they conducted a number of frac jobs during the quarter and where we continue to build infrastructure and service capacity. In Brazil, activity remained strong, driven by both land and offshore, and we secured the main share or the multi-year Petrobras Wireline contract which was awarded during the quarter. In Europe/CIS/Africa, we continue to show good progress with 5% sequential revenue growth and margins up 236 basis points, driven by increased demand for our high-end exploration services and further supported by good cost management. ", "During the quarter, Russia reached a new oil production record in the post-Soviet era, and activity levels in Western Siberia and Sakhalin continue to see strong growth as overall investment sentiment in our customer base remains positive. We continued to strengthen our position in the Russian market with the award of all the services for the first project in the Russian Arctic, while the integration of the new services from the Eurasia transaction continued to progress on plan. ", "In the North sea, we saw strong growth, driven by high-exploration activity in the U.K. and Greenland, partly offset by lower activity in Norway due to annual platform maintenance. In Poland, we performed several multistage frac jobs as part of the ongoing shale gas exploration and appraisal progress, and we continue to build infrastructure and service capacity in the country. Angola saw strong growth in both pre-sold exploration activity and development activity in the main projects. ", "Activity in North Africa, East Africa and the Gulf of Guinea remained flat during the quarter, but are currently expected to resume the growth trends in the fourth quarter. Libya activity remained shut down for the quarter, but we currently have people on the ground and expect to resume some activity during the fourth quarter. ", "Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights of the quarter. In Reservoir Characterization, we have, over the past quarters, seen the start of a new exploration cycle through the demand for high-end Wireline and well testing services. Given the complexity and costs of these exploration campaigns, the need to de-risk potential prospects is becoming ever more important. While seismic technology advances have made significant contributions to better evaluate structural risks, almost 3/4 of the dry exploration wells are due to lack of understanding of seal and charge risks. These risks can be better addressed through petroleum system modeling, which looks at the formation and movement of hydrocarbons over time. ", "We are the only provider of a fully software-enabled workflow built on Petrel that cover seismic and petrophysical interpretation, as well as petroleum system modeling. The sale of this workflow is showing very good growth as it allows us to better help our customers reevaluate the exploration potential of mature basins and also further de-risk prospects of frontier areas. ", "In the Drilling Group, the Smith integration continues to progress well, and cost and revenue synergies are set to exceed even our revised targets for the year. The combination of Schlumberger and Smith drilling technologies continue to drive drilling performance for our customers, as you can see from the press release. The Smith transaction also continued to be accretive on an earnings per share basis in the third quarter. ", "Drilling & Measurements continue to penetrate the market with their latest technologies, including the PowerDrive Archer high build rate rotary steerable system, the Scope service and the latest MicroScope formation imager. During the quarter, a number of high-profile jobs were conducted successfully with these technologies for customers throughout the world. ", "In the Reservoir Production group, deployment of HiWAY technology in the pressure pumping market continues to grow. In North America, the number of customers using HiWAY had grown from 2 only a year ago to more than 20 today, and we completed over 800 stages during the quarter in this market alone. HiWAY continues to deliver higher gas and liquid production, while using significantly less water and proppant compared to conventional fracturing systems. This provides us with significant pricing and cost leverage versus our competitors, a factor that will become even more important when the North America pressure pumping market eventually become saturated with hydraulic horsepower. I would also add that HiWAY is starting to gain momentum in the international markets, including Russia, North Africa and the Middle East. ", "Turning now to the outlook. The current financial turmoil has already resulted in a lower outlook for oil demand growth in 2012, although demand growth is still expected to exceed that of 2011. However, recent production data, as well as forward projections, indicate that there is a tight cushion of excess oil supply that will continue to support activity. Therefore, while the financial turmoil introduces some uncertainty over near-term activity, it has yet to have an impact on the actual activity of our customers.", "We also remain confident that any potential reductions will be short-lived and that the outlook for the service industry remains very positive. We further believe that our customers' drive to renew reserves, as evidenced by the recent string of exploration successes, particularly in deepwater offshore areas, favors our broad international footprint. In addition, the balance between our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and production technologies both in North America and overseas will enable us to weather any activity fluctuations. Thank you very much. I would now hand the call over for the Q&A session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Thanks for the update on your outlook there, and this is what I want to touch a little bit more in depth. The service talks have hit really a rough patch over the last couple of months. Investors are clearly concerned about the timing. International is getting pushed out, and North America markets kind of roll. So I wonder if you could just kind of dig in a little bit more in terms of your outlook over the next 12 to 18 months. In particular, which regions or countries do you think are going to be big drivers? And I guess more specifically, kind of what's the tone been like with your NOC customers? Are you getting any sense of their concern?  Are they just going to continue to move ahead with their projects? You mentioned a little slippage in Saudi, but it didn't sound like you were all that concerned there.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No. Just to answer the last part of your question first, the feedback we have from our NOC customers is that they are continuing with the programs that they already have in place. They are clearly long-term investors and the projects that they have is for the long term, so we have really seen no change to their plans whatsoever. Now if I look at the next 12 to 18 months, or 2012 in particular, firstly at the international market -- so provided that there is no major impact from the European debt crisis on our business and we haven't seen any impact yet, we basically maintain quite a positive outlook on the international markets, and this is really driven by our customers that have a long-term view in areas such as Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Russia, Iraq and West Africa. And this trend is also further supported by strong underlying trends in both exploration and deepwater. I think in exploration there's a clear need to have reserves for our customers after the investment levels over the past 2, 3 years have been severely cut. And I think they are generally encouraged by the string of exploration successes globally that we've seen in the past couple of quarters. And similarly on the deepwater side, 2011 is going to see the highest number of newbuild arrivals ever. The total number is going to be around 36, which obviously will have a positive impact on the deepwater activity in 2012. And we also see quite positive trends for contracts for these newbuild arrivals and also for overall utilization and rig rates. Now if we switch to North America, we see basically higher level of uncertainty around North America. Now in North America, we're quite positive on Canada and Gulf of Mexico. We think both of them are going to be quite strong for the next year, and we have obviously very good market positions in both these markets. So I would say that the main uncertainty we see in North America is around pressure pumping pricing. And this is linked really to the amount of new horsepower capacity that is coming into the market, and there's also some concern on the cost inflation that we are seeing currently. So I think that's basically a high-level outlook of how I see it. Andrew, do you want to add something on the overall macro view?", "Andrew Gould", "Yes. I think we've said before and I'll say again, that the thing our customers dislike most, just like financial markets, is uncertainty. And I think that you have to assume that before 2012 starts, the European Union will come to some sort of resolution on their sovereign debt crisis. And if you couple that with the fact that actually, the supply situation is probably the tightest it's been since 2006, it's certainly tighter now than it was in 2008. And if you look at the U.S. inventories yesterday, they went below the 5-year average both for products and crude for the first time since 2008. So absent a really deep cut in demand, which would basically mean the developing economies going into recession, there's no reason at this point in time to suppose that international activity is not going to remain pretty robust in the year to come. And I totally subscribe to everything that Paal just said about deepwater exploration. The rate of success over the last quarter -- 2 quarters and actually ongoing success is really quite remarkable, and that's only going to encourage more of it.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So, Paal, as a follow-up on the exploration side, you're talking about that picking up. Is that in your numbers yet in terms of the growth? I mean, is there a way to kind of help us understand how much of the growth internationally, say, over the last several quarter come from exploration? Or is that going to come in as we kind of go through 2012? Is that kind of the real kind of growth part that you're seeing?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Some of the exploration activity is obviously in our numbers and if you look at all the discoveries that we've seen, in particular over the past quarter. But I would say there is still significant growth potential in this. One discovery obviously creates a lot of additional activity around that discovery. And I think there's also a strong inventory of prospects that our customers are going to pursue. So I would say that while we have seen some increase in the high-end sales of services for both Wireline and testing and as well as in exploration software over the recent quarters, I think there is still significant upside in exploration going into next year.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the line of Brad Handler at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess I'd like to follow-up on the outlook, if I may, but the first question actually pertains a little bit more to Q4, if we could bring in the time horizon. I guess really the easy way to put it, there's some pretty -- what seems like some pretty aggressive revenue growth outlooks embedded within current consensus thinking on Q4. So maybe I could ask you to reach beyond what you would normally do with respect to sort of expectation setting and say, is it reasonable to expect sort of double-digit growth globally in Q4 on the revenue side?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So normally, we don't go into details of the coming quarter, right? So I wouldn't comment specifically on how I see revenue growth going up. But my general comment would be that there is -- provided there's no significant changes to the plans for Q4 that we see from our customers at this stage, we firstly expect Q4 to show continued progress in line with the underlying trends that we have kind of outlined throughout the year. Looking at the consensus for Q4, I would say though that the current estimates that we see, I would say are somewhat on the optimistic side.", "Brad Handler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. I guess as a somewhat related follow-up, but going back your commentary about the deepwater rigs coming in, the numbers are very impressive. You talk about floating rigs up. You're looking at deepwater floaters up 16% year-on-year in terms of supply in '12 by our count. Is that -- is it reasonable therefore for us to think about your offshore business in '12 as doing somewhat better than that? I mean, assuming you're keeping market share and exploration weighted activity helping your relative position. Is that how you're thinking about the '12 opportunity in the offshore, that you could be approaching 20% revenue growth year-on-year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well again, I wouldn't comment straight on the percentage number. But I would say that I share your positive view on the activity outlook for deepwater. I think if you look at our market share position, it is already quite good. I would also say that the sell-off potential and the draw on high-end services that I would see going into 2012 for these type of operations is also quite good. So I think we are very well placed in terms of being on the deepwater rigs, and we have a very high, I would say, value outlook on the -- on our technology portfolio going into next year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Kurt Hallead at RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I was just curious if you can give us some indication on the Iraqi operations. What kind of revenue run rate are you right now? And you mentioned that -- you mentioned something about profitability, so I guess we can all assume that you are currently profitable and not waiting to be profitable like maybe some of your competitors. So in that context, can you just give us some general sense of kind of what the revenue run rate is in Iraq? And if you were to look at the profitability in Iraq, is that above or below what your Middle East, Far East margins are currently?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So looking at the Q3 performance, we showed continued progress in terms of activity, and we set new records in terms of revenue and margins. So the numbers I gave you after the Q2 call -- broke [ph] $100 million for the quarter in Q2. For Q3, we had double-digit revenue growth. And if you look at the Schlumberger legacy business, which makes up over 90% of our Iraqi revenue, we have over 20% IBT for the full quarter. Now for the Smith segments that we are bringing -- we're currently bringing into the country, they are somewhat lower because we have significant startup costs as we bring them into the country. Now during Q3, we also got extensions for several of our existing contracts, and we were also awarded 3 new significant contracts that we are already mobilizing for. So I would say that we are not waiting to be profitable in Iraq. We are very profitable. And if you look at that profitability number that I just gave you, that is now getting very close to the average of MEA.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then follow-up would be, getting a number of questions from varying investors about if you took the seismic impact away for the third quarter, what would the international revenue growth rate and what would international margins look like if it were not for the impacts on seismic? And I was wondering if you could provide us with some more color on that. Once again, it is a topic of high interest for a lot that are listening to the call.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I understand. So like we said -- like I said in my prepared remarks, most of the impact of WesternGeco seismic was -- we saw that in MEA. There was some limited impact in LAM, but not as significant as in MEA. If you look at MEA and you take seismic out, the growth in MEA was pretty much in line with the growth in the rig count, and the profitability of MEA was more or less in line with the previous quarter. Maybe slightly down, but more or less in line with the previous quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So, Andrew, I presume this will be your last conference call, so I will take the opportunity to kind of tap into your global perspective and backdrop. And clearly, the balance and development in the spare capacity in the oil market near term is of great interest to everybody right now. And I wonder whether you could share your high-level thoughts there. Libya is coming back. Things are going on in Iraq. North Sea might be coming back. Should we be concerned about buildup of spare capacity in the global oil market on a, say, 6 months view?", "Andrew Gould", "I don't think so. I mean I don't think any of the single events you mentioned are significant enough to make a fundamental difference in an 85 million, 86 million barrel-a-day scenario. There's always going to be something else that goes down. None of these are increments that are really going to change the overall balance. The only thing that would change the overall balance will be a demand drop. And actually so far the signs of a demand drop even in the OECD are not particularly powerful. So I don't see it. I don't see that supply could change the picture in the short term. And by the way, Ole, if Paal invites me, I will come and say goodbye to you in January.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We'll invite you, Andrew.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "We'd appreciate that. Any other sort of thoughts, Andrew, on what you think the market vibe might be under-appreciating now given the amount of stress in your stock and...", "Andrew Gould", "Well, I think it's not just our stock. I think a lot of quality stocks, there's a dislocation between market sentiment and the underlying realities. And that dislocation, as I sort of said earlier, I think is likely due to uncertainty, which everybody hates, which is why some form of resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis, which is going to come, is likely to be an event that will settle people's nerves. But a lot of industries, not just ours, the fundamentals are not nearly as bad as people seem to imagine. They are anticipating the worst.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Good to hear. And, Paal, you did comment on the fourth quarter, so you did open that Pandora's box. You did suggest it was somewhat optimistic. But is it completely crazy? Or I mean, you do have a fourth quarter which is going to be a seismic rebound. I mean, clearly what happened in the Middle East region on contract seismic should normalize. There are other factors that are seasonally strong in the fourth quarter. So I mean, is it completely crazy? Or is it is slightly optimistic? And I do realize that as the incoming CEO, you will not set the bar low, so let's get that out of the way.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think we've normally gone further than what we normally do on this. So I'm not going to go further than what I already said. I think the current consensus is somewhat on the optimistic side.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Paal, I just want to circle back on the Latin America margin performance. I know you mentioned mix in the quarter here. Just curious, strong revenue quarter yet margins are down in total. Brazil was mentioned on the Geco side. You mentioned the IPM project in Mexico. Can you talk a little bit more about the margin degradation you saw sequentially there, and then just near-term outlook there going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Just focusing first on the margin, I'm not really worried about the Latin America margins. The reason why it dropped during Q3 is down to the revenue mix. If you look at where we grew the most, it was in Mexico and Argentina, and that had some impact on the overall margins. Brazil was still good. We had some impact from Columbia as well on an IPM production incentive project there, where we had some shortening of production. But in addition to that, the oil price obviously was down during the quarter as well, which had some impact. So when you said the overall underlying margin in Latin America, I'm quite comfortable with. In terms of the outlook, I think that's quite positive. Mexico continues to add rigs offshore and mainly on shallow water, but also some in the deepwater. We've seen a rebound in the IPM activity, both on the Mesozoic Aliansan [ph] and Chicontepec, which sort of bodes well for our Mexico outlook. And we also got 1 out of the 3 first production incentive contracts awarded in Mexico as well. So I would say, generally our outlook for Mexico is good. Brazil, as you all know, is obviously very strong. There's a continued influx of deepwater rigs in Q4. We're probably going to reach up to 64 rigs by year end in Brazil. All customers are active, both Petrobras, the IOCs and the independents. And we're also seeing a pickup in activity in Argentina related to shale gas, as well as strong activity both in Colombia and to a certain extent in Venezuela. So I think overall, Latin America is looking strong.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "And as my follow-up, Paal, you reiterated again this quarter -- or it was discussed again about North America pricing momentum led by Drilling and Wireline, and you made commentary with regard to your pressure pumping outlook. Do you see the Drilling and Wireline product lines pushing net pricing higher for you in the U.S. and North America as a whole, certainly given your outlook of a more challenging backdrop on the pressure pumping side?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think there's still more lag to pricing in both Drilling and Wireline. I think we're seeing a flattening of pricing to a certain extent on pressure pumping. I think what is also going to drive the mix of the pricing in North America is Gulf of Mexico, which is -- we are now adding one deepwater rig per month. We have a very strong market share position both on Drilling and on Wireline in the Gulf of Mexico. So I think the overall pricing for -- both those market segments still have upside on the pricing side in NAM.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "And enough as you see it, given that mix, to absorb the cost inflation that seems to be prevalent now in the industry, in the U.S.?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think cost inflation is one. But I think what is more interesting is what's going to happen to the pressure pumping pricing. As at some stage, we will approach more than equilibrium in terms of horsepower supply and demand. And so we are obviously doing what we can to manage the cost inflation on the pressure pumping side. I think what is going to be more dominant or more important is going to be what happens to the pricing going forward on pressure pumping.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of James West of Barclays Capital.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Paal, the issues at WesternGeco this quarter seemed pretty transitory to me. So I think, one, is that the case? And then what's the outlook on the seismic business for the rest of this year and into next year? And are we at the point now where you think we can get some real pricing traction on the Marine side?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So in general, I would say that we are still quite positive when it comes our seismic outlook. Now if you look at the Marine market, Q4 and Q1 are normally softer quarters, as the vessels finish off mainly the North sea season. Now this year, we were expecting higher activity in West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, and we also expected that this type of activity would offset the seasonal softness or weakness that I just referred to. And the fact that we would have higher of activity in West Africa and Gulf of Mexico would present some opportunity to test pricing. Now what we've seen in reality is that the ramp-up of activity in both places have been slower than expected, but we don't see this as being structural. There's basically delay in signing of contracts and also somewhat slower mobilization of additional vessels into the Gulf of Mexico. So I think we would see the normal softness that we see every year in Q4 and Q1 on Marine. But looking forward to Q2 and Q3 of 2012, the slate is already filling up quite nicely there. There's very good tender activity for all the basins: North Sea, Barents Sea, Angola, Brazil and so forth. So the outlook for 2012 is, I think, still quite positive. We were hoping to get some pricing traction at the end of this year. I think this is now pushed out a couple of quarters. But beyond that, we remain still quite optimistic and positive on the seismic market.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And with respect to near-term quarters, would the multiclient data library sales offset some of that vessel weakness? I mean, would 4Q WesternGeco be weaker than 3Q? I mean, 3Q seemed to have more one-off issues.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, absolutely. So the third quarter had a number of one-off issue. I think overall WesternGeco will be up in Q4, and that would in part be driven by higher multiclient sales. But I think also, some of the issues we had both on land and Marine are being rectified and we will have stronger performance, I would say, in all product lines of WesternGeco in Q4.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to try to reconcile a little bit just this color on the international growth rates and your optimism. One of the differences that I see in Schlumberger's portfolio is the mix of rig-less services, excluding seismic. And I was hoping, Paal, maybe you could contrast sort of growth rates in rig-less capabilities relative to rig count or just sort of general wellbore construction. And maybe highlight some product and service lines and geographies where growth is perhaps a bit stronger.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say overall in the rig-less activity, we have seen pretty good growth in recent quarters and I expect that to continue into 2012. I think part of our portfolio that is probably somewhat underestimated is our abilities within rig-less from Wireline cased hole to coiled tubing and to slickline, where we have #1 market positions in all of these product lines. So I'm -- we are putting a lot of effort into growing this part of our business, and I'm quite optimistic in terms of how these product lines are going to perform going into next year. And I think where you'll probably see more on growth in these type of product lines is partly on land. Now there's also opportunities offshoring it, right? But generally, I think we'll see strong growth in the rig-less activity going into next year.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Stronger than wellbore construction, do you think?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think there's still some uncertainty around wellbore constructions when it comes overall rig count and so forth. But I thought this is more independent to the rig count, right? So it all depends on what happens on the rig count growth. It's a bit difficult to say. But the fact that it's going to represent strong growth, I'm quite confident in.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And, Andrew, maybe I could address the second one to you. As it pertains to some of the technologies around completion, I think that you sort of set the high bar of expectation in terms of the migration of moving from brute force to more intelligent drilling and completion activity. But it strikes me as we move in that direction that -- with HiWAY and the reference to COPPERHEAD in the press release, that there's a portfolio of capabilities, call them incremental technologies, that are moving us in that direction and sort of getting away from just pure horsepower more immediately than sort of waiting for the drill-perfect kind of solution. Can you talk about that portfolio perhaps, and put COPPERHEAD and HiWAY within that context?", "Andrew Gould", "I think what -- it's perhaps important to start by saying is that when I said brute force and ignorance, I never for a moment imagined that hydraulic fracturing is going to disappear. But firstly, proper characterization will reduce the necessity to geometrically frac in order to obtain a correct IP and therefore, eliminate a large amount of waste. And products like HiWAY or COPPERHEAD or other things that we're working on in Well Services in particular, will serve to provide, as HiWAY does, a better frac but using less proppant, sand, chemical and all the rest of it. So we don't -- we're not, for a minute -- that we're going to apply the unconventional just to our Reservoir Characterization workflow. It is also technology we're working on in both pressure pumping and in completions. It's a suite. But the big step forward, and you may have noticed as well that Paal referred in his commentary to the fact that we now have a unique seismic spread in one of the unconventional basins on land in North America, which is beginning to show that -- the appreciation that proper characterization before you start frac-ing is going to save you a lot of money.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So is it fair to say that, in effect, the value creation comes from not just the application of more intelligence and characterization, but also in the reduction of capital intensity?", "Andrew Gould", "Absolutely, absolutely. I'm still convinced that long term, the cost of producing unconventional gas is going to decline.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Paal, and I guess Simon as well. In light of your commentary, Paal, with regard to a transition in pressure pumping pricing in North America likely at hand, how should we think about the 2012 capital spending budget at this juncture? Is it likely to be up year-over-year? Or what's the likely path on that front?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So if you look at our original plans for 2012, we were looking to add from the 2011 levels. We are maintaining our capacity to add both from a supplier and from a manufacturing standpoint. I'm not talking about global CapEx. To what extent we will add, I think, is going to be a function of what comes out of the budgeting cycle of our customers. But generally, we are maintaining our capacity to add CapEx going into 2012.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "All right, so capital spending translation is likely higher year-over-year.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think it generally will be higher. To what level higher, I think we'll come back to you in a quarter's time.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Understood. And then secondly, you guys I think have been sensibly balanced, if you will, with regard to the evolution of the development of the international unconventional resource. And yet, you read through this release and you have more than a few wins here with regard to what's going on in Poland, in Argentina and using HiWAY in North Africa and what have you. Do you have an update with regard to what your expected timeline is with regard to the blossoming of the unconventional play? And is it evolving more quickly than what you thought maybe a couple of quarters ago?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So I think we've always been, I would say, positive on the outlook for unconventional resources internationally. If you look at some of the reports coming back, the estimated resource base for unconventional gas overseas is 6x that of the U.S. So I think we've always been positive on that. I think the main thing we've been saying is firstly, that we're going to have to go through a phase of exploration and appraisal to understand these resources internationally. And I think also, the approach to how they are going to be developed are going to be different than what we do in North America, and more in line with what Andrew just described, which is focused on a more scientific approach where there is more upfront investment in the characterization, and also it's going to have to be focused on using less resources for the drilling and completions of these wells as well. So we are actively pursuing all these exploration and appraisal projects in all parts of the world, whether this is Argentina, Colombia, Canada, Poland, India and China and so forth, right? So we are, I think, very well placed to play a strong role in the international shale market. I think the volume of activity is still going to take some time before it gets there, but I think there's been encouraging results from the exploration and appraisal projects. So I think the outlook is positive, but it's not going to be as significant as what we have seen in North America over the 4 -- in the past 4 or 5 years, in the coming years at least.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, and if I could slip on in here with Simon. Simon, do you have handy what the sequential revenue increase was in U.S. and Canada, respectively?", "Simon Ayat", "Of course I have them. But we've seen the 15% overall NAM increase and we'll leave it at that. I'm not going to separate it between Canada and the U.S., but Canada had a significant increase obviously because of the spring break-up.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Jim Crandell at Dahlman Rose.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Andrew and Paal, you spoke very positively about the outlook for deepwater. And one of your -- I believe one of your competitors said the most competitive pricing part of the market was in deepwater and on longer contracts, and you talked about some improvement. Are you actually seeing some improvement in the deepwater area in terms of pricing? Or is that an area that's not really shown improvement in pricing and you're getting it somewhere else?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at the deepwater pricing, the -- I would say it's still generally competitive. But I think what we see on the deepwater side is that there is a continued, I would say, value puts on our technology and the integrity that we have of our operations, right? So in some cases, we are able to get a pricing premium for the performance that we are able to offer up on these very highly expensive rigs. There's also been an increase though on the high-end services that we offer up as part of the contracts on these rigs, right? So I think overall pricing on deepwater, we are -- I'm quite happy with.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And, Paal, what -- different subject, but what new or recent technology introduction with Schlumberger, let's say, over the last year to 18 months, do you feel will have the biggest commercial impact on the company in 2012?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I don't know. If I single out one, then I'm going to get a lot of my segments upset, right, so I'm going to have to be careful with that. But I would say that if I look at some of the key introductions that we've done over the past year, I would say for Wireline, I have a lot of hope and faith in the Dielectric Scanner. I think what this can offer up in terms of high-end petrophysical evaluations is going to be good. I referenced in my prepared remarks several D&M technologies: PowerDrive Archer, MicroScope, SonicScope. These are all, I think, going to have -- they're going to create very good value for Drilling & Measurement. We've also introduced several new drill bits technologies, in particular the spare bits, which is focused in on unconventionals, which I think is going to be good. And obviously HiWAY, without saying, has a very significant impact today. And I think as we continue to widen the customer base for HiWAY, it's going to have a very significant impact on pressure pumping both in North America and overseas. And then one other key technology, which again Andrew referenced, is the UniQ land seismic. This is a single-sensor land seismic system where you can basically house up to 100,000 channels, and it's going to give us a lot better quality images for both structure and also for endorsing the rest of our properties. And then the last part, which I also referenced in my prepared remarks, is our abilities now in terms of exploration software and petroleum system modeling. These are some of the key technologies that we have introduced, which I have a lot of faith in going forward.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and one quick one for Andrew. Andrew, after the elections in Mexico, would you expect drilling in Chicontepec to come back significantly? And if so, what sort of form do you think the contracts could take over there?", "Andrew Gould", "Look, I don't think that the elections have a huge impact on spending in Chicontepec. What will have an impact on spending in Chicontepec, and so far we don't seem to have a clear case, is a method of improving their recovery from this reservoir, which as you know, is extremely difficult. And while there are lots of different experiments going on, I don't think there's a conclusion on it yet. So I don't think the election will have any effect.", "James Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so you really would not expect at this point Chicontepec to come back to any meaningful extent in 2012.", "Andrew Gould", "Only if Pemex is satisfied that one of the technologies that they're applying to improve recovery is really working.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Angie Sedita at UBS.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. Clearly, the international and deepwater recoveries is far and away the bigger story for Schlumberger. But on North America, you touched on the uncertainty in pressure pumping pricing. Given the capacity that we're adding today and next year, do you think in a flat rig market in the U.S. that we could reach a balanced or oversupply scenario in 2012? And then your thoughts on your North American margins in a flat rig market in 2012.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So in terms of trying to predict when we're getting to horsepower balance in terms of supply and demand, I'm not going to do that. I -- obviously, with a flatter rig count it's likely to happen sooner, but I'm not going to venture out and say exactly when that's going to happen. I think the impact on pricing will be a function of when it happens, but it's also going to be a question of when we think it's going to happen. So I think you will have impact on pricing even before you actually get to saturation, right? If you look at our plans with that backdrop, we are at this stage continuing to add horsepower, and we will continue to add horsepower until we see an actual change in the market, that being either change to our customer plans or change to the utilization of our assets. And we haven't really seen anything in terms of these changes yet. But we are continuing to add, and the reason for this is that we are actually looking to gain pressure pumping market share. And we are looking to gain share through our HiWAY technology, and also by bundling our pressure pumping with the shale reservoir characterization workflow that we have highlighted, right? So we are continuing to add the function of when the supply and demand is going to meet in horsepower. I'm not going to make a prediction on when it's going to happen. It will eventually happen. I think that's what I would say.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, and then a follow-up to that. So the horsepower that you're adding, are you -- are your plans only for the first 6 months of the year? Or is it so far for the full year? And then how much of your frac fleet is under term today?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we have a relative flexible way of handling how we add the resources, right? So we have a very good relationship with our suppliers here. So we are looking out for -- in various time horizons. So I'm not going to say exactly how we're going to add quarter-by-quarter. But we are -- we have the capacity to add throughout next year if we choose to. In terms of what part of contracts we have on terms, there's still a good mix between our spot market and longer-term contracts.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then touching back on the fourth quarter. You touched on revenues, but a little bit on margins. Broadside on North America with the seasonality going into Q4, could you see some modest margin pressure just due to the holidays? And then thoughts on your international margins for Q4. In Q3 you were at 18%. With the seasonal jump in Q4, could you move to the 20% range?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I'm going to have to give you the same answer I gave to Ole, right. We have already ventured further off than what we typically do in indicating what's going to happen to the next quarter. So I would just reiterate that the EPS consensus estimate at this stage is probably on the optimistic side.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, in the international markets, is there any market that you're concerned that may be slow or sluggish versus the areas that you pointed out that should be quite strong in 2012?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I think in general not. We've indicated in the Q2 call that the growth in international market is not going to be linear. So you will always potentially have an off quarter in some of these markets. But generally, I don't have any particular concerns in any parts of the international market in terms of the growth potential.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The U.K. North Sea should be...", "Andrew Gould", "I get it; I get it. Cut her off.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The outlook for the U.K. North Sea should be okay, flat, not down.", "Andrew Gould", "Angie, it's Andrew. Can I remind you our rules? It's one question and one follow-up. And we do need to get our last question in. Thank you, Angie.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from the line of Geoff Kieburtz at Weeden & Co.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division", "Paal, just to clarify a comment I think you made during your prepared comments that pressure pumping pricing has flattened in the liquids market and declined in the gas regions. If that's right, then pressure pumping prices fell in the third quarter. Can you clarify what you said earlier?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I was saying that the pressure pumping pricing in the liquids-rich basins was flattening during the quarter, but we saw a modest drop in prices in the gas basin.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division", "So overall, pressure pumping prices still climbed in the third quarter.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Slightly.", "Andrew Gould", "They climbed slightly, yes.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division", "Okay, all right. And not to be too cute, Schlumberger has forecasted a rolling over of pressure pumping margins and pricing several times in the past. What -- and I understand your point that it will happen at some point, but are you seeing things -- and perhaps it's just what you just said, the pricing -- that makes you more certain that it is going to happen and it's going to happen in a reasonably near future?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So again, I'm not saying that it's going to happen in the near future. I'm just saying that during the third quarter, we saw flattening of the liquids-rich basin pricing, which we haven't seen in recent quarter -- quarters. And I'm also saying that there is a significant amount of horsepower coming into the market as we speak and also going into next year. So my concern on the North America outlook is what is going to happen to pressure pumping pricing.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division", "Right, okay. And on HiWAY, kind of a technical question I guess. My recollection was at the analyst event this year, that at that time, HiWAY wasn't delivering a reduction in water usage but now, clearly, it is. Is HiWAY -- should we be thinking about HiWAY as still an evolving and developing technology?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think, absolutely. So whether you reduce only proppant or whether you reduce proppant, water and potentially horsepower, is a function of how you design your jobs, and it's also a function of what type of jobs -- what conventional type of jobs you are replacing, right? So that's one thing. But I think to your second point, it is clearly an evolving technology. We are putting a lot of effort into the application range of HiWAY, and we are also putting a lot of effort into how we design the jobs to be -- to make it even more impactful in terms of how it can reduce resources and basically provide more production for less. So yes, it is clearly evolving. And I'm actually very optimistic with the traction we are now getting with the customer base. With any new technology, and I would say also maybe in particular in North America land, it takes time to break through and penetrate the market with a new technology. And I think we are starting to get some good traction.", "Geoff Kieburtz - Weeden & Co., LP, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could squeeze a third one in here, please. On the international pricing, the Texas early signs of pricing traction, specifically for Wireline and D&M. This is -- it seems on the surface to be quite similar to the comments that have been made in prior quarters. Can you point to something specific that's changed? Or is it just that we continue to be in this state that it looks imminent?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I think what we said in the earlier quarters is that we expected to see pricing traction towards the end of this year. That's what we said earlier. And what I'm saying this quarter is that we are actually seeing some signs of it. There's really 2 signs I would highlight. First of all, higher demand and higher sales of our high-end technology. So there's a lot more salable technology from basic technology to high end. And secondly, we are also testing pricing on specific contracts, typically smaller contracts, with reasonable success.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Keely will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Keeley. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from Paris today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal.

", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.98. This is a decrease of $0.13 sequentially and an increase of $0.27 compared to the same quarter last year. ", "Oilfield Services first quarter revenue of $9.9 billion decreased 4% sequentially. This decrease is largely attributable to the effect of the traditional year-end surge in product, software and multiclient sales that we experienced in the Q4, as well as the previously announced lower reutilization and downward pricing trend in our North America hydraulic fracturing business. ", "Oilfield Services pretax income of $1.9 billion decreased 10.4% sequentially while pretax operating margins declined 147 basis points. Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion decreased 7% sequentially, and margin declined 189 basis points to 26%. These decreases were due to the seasonally strong WesternGeco market client sales, robust year -- end of year SIS software sales that we experienced in the Q4. ", "Drilling Group first quarter revenue of $3.8 billion was flat sequentially, while margins improved 28 basis points to 17.4%. First quarter Production Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 4.4% sequentially, while pretax margin fell 338 basis points to 17.6%. These decreases were primarily attributable to the pricing pressure, lower utilization and cost inflation in Well Services North America, as well as the effect of the seasonally strong completion and Artificial Lift Q4 product sales. ", "From a geographic perspective, North America margins declined 409 basis points to 22.8%, while international margins were essentially flat at 19.1%, despite the significant impact of the Q4 product and software sales and the seasonal drop in activity in Russia, China and the North Sea during Q1. ", "The Distribution segment contributed $713 million in revenue and $35 million in pretax operating income. Last week, we announced that we reached an agreement to sell Wilson. We will, therefore, report our entire Distribution segment as a discontinued operation in the second quarter. ", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.8% in the first quarter, consistent with the previous quarter. We still expect the effective tax rate for the full year 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographical mix of earnings. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.8 billion as compared to $4.85 billion at the end of Q4, representing a $951 million increase, resulting from the seasonal deterioration in working capital we typically see during Q1. ", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $961 million of CapEx and $324 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.38 million shares at an average price of $74. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011. And now I turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. Our first quarter results showed good progress as we continued our strong focus on execution and operational excellence. In terms of activity, we saw growth in exploration and deepwater markets in line with our outlook for the year, while we experienced the normal seasonal slowdown in multiclient and product sales, as well as in activity levels in some areas of the northern hemisphere. ", "In North America, we executed well in all parts of the business during the quarter. Sequential revenue was down 3.5%, and margins were down 409 basis points, driven by lower multiclient sales and the dynamics in the hydraulic fracturing market. We have, over the past 2 quarters, signaled that hydraulic fracturing pricing is starting to come under pressure. And during the first quarter, the downwards pricing trend seen in the gas basins also reached the liquids-rich basins. So far, the pricing impact varies by basin as excess capacity is moved around, but we expect to see lower pricing reaching all basins in the coming quarters. In addition, the continued movement of rigs and frac capacity adds costs and lowers utilization, which together with the pricing impact, puts pressure on margins. ", "Elsewhere in North America land, our wireline logging, coiled tubing and some drilling product lines saw revenue growth, while pricing remained flat to slightly up. In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity grew in line with our outlook for the year and was further supported by a number of new drilling permits granted during the quarter. Our deepwater market share and operational performance remains very strong and are reflected in our operating margins, which are now back to pre-moratorium levels. ", "In the international markets, revenue was down 4% sequentially due to lower product sales and the seasonal slowdown in Russia, China and the North Sea. At the same time, sequential margins were essentially flat, driven by very strong execution in all areas. During the quarter, international activity progressed in line with our outlook for the year, driven by the deepwater and exploration markets, in particular in East and West Africa and also by strong land activity in the Middle East and North Africa. ", "In terms of pricing, bidding remained competitive on large tenders for standard technology. However, we see pricing sentiments are starting to move upwards, as most of the large international contracts have now been rebid and our service capacity is getting tighter. Before discussing the quarter's results by area, I have a few comments on Marine seismic where vessel utilization was strong during the first quarter. At this stage, we are already fully booked for Q2, while Q3 capacity is filling up quickly, driven by higher activity in West Africa, the North Sea, the Arctic regions and Brazil. While some of the upcoming work was bid last year, current bid pricing is up around 10%, and we expect pricing to continue to go up as the year progresses. The WesternGeco backlog increased by 16% during the quarter. ", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue was down by 4% sequentially, while margins were down 40 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong activity growth in both Saudi Arabia and Oman, and this trend is set to continue for both countries in the coming quarters. In Iraq, the steep growth trends took a pause in the first quarter, as a number of our customers postponed awards and startups of new contracts, due to uncertainties around the security situation and infrastructure capacity. Towards the end of the quarter, sentiments were again turning positive. And following award of the outstanding bids in the second quarter, we expect to see strong growth in the second half of the year. ", "In Latin America, revenue was down 4% sequentially, while margins were up by 182 basis points. In Mexico, offshore activity continued to grow during the quarter, and we also saw a moderate increase in IPM activity on land. We are currently mobilizing for the Carrizo production incentive contract, with operation scheduled to start around midyear. In Brazil, the deepwater rig count remained flat during the quarter, while we saw solid activity in our IPM projects. There continues to be active bidding for Petrobras with award of the main outstanding contracts likely taking place over the next quarters. In Ecuador, we signed a production incentive contract for the Shushufindi field during the quarter, with planned start-up around midyear. ", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue decreased by 3% sequentially while margins were down by 109 basis points. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in activity in Nigeria, Angola and East Africa, driven by both deepwater exploration and the major development projects. And the activity outlook for seismic and rig-related services in this region remains very positive. In Russia and the North Sea, we experienced a normal seasonal slowdown due to winter weather, but both markets are on track for solid activity growth for the year. In Libya, activity continued to grow during the quarter, and we're also back to profitability in March. Activity will continue to ramp up during the year, as additional rigs become available and is set to reach pre-conflict levels in early 2013. ", "Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights. The Reservoir Characterization group saw continuing strength in exploration and deepwater activity during the quarter, as witnessed by the number of high-technology logging and Testing Services deployed in projects around the world. In addition, we previewed our new generation seismic streamer during the quarter, which uses a novel 4-component sensor to measure the reflected wave in much more detail, including its direction. This is a major step forward for marine seismic, similar to the medical industry moving from a 2D x-ray to a full 3D CAT scan, and it will further widen our technology lead in Marine seismic. ", "In land seismic, we continue to deploy our new, unique technology, which offers a step change in land seismic imaging quality. In addition to operating UniQ on our own land seismic crews, WesternGeco recently created a new division to sell and lease the UniQ technology to other service companies, as well as to energy companies who maintain their own crews. The decision to sell and lease the UniQ technology will open up an additional $1.3 billion market for our WesternGeco product line. ", "In the Drilling Group, new technologies introduced during the quarter included the MicroScope high resolution resistivity and imaging service, which will further support our customers in estimating reserves, placing horizontal wells and optimizing completion design. In addition, the Pathfinder iPZIG at-bit inclination and imaging service helps optimize well placement in target zones and is developed for unconventional oil and gas markets. The iPZIG service has already been successfully field tested in coalbed methane, heavy oil and shale plays in North America and Australia. ", "In the Production Group, HiWAY activity continued to grow rapidly with operations conducted for more than 45 clients during the quarter and with a number of fracturing stages growing by more than 25% sequentially. In addition to deploying HiWAY through our traditional business model, we also introduced the Spark [ph] business model in the past quarter to expand the market uptake of HiWAY. Here, we provide HiWAY job engineering and monitoring, proponent chemicals, as well as blending services, while the hydraulic horsepower, which often makes up 2/3 of the well-side CapEx, is provided by a third party. To date, we have pumped around 70 HiWAY stages in North America with the Spark [ph] model, and we will start conducting jobs in key international markets in the coming quarters. ", "Also during the quarter, Framo Engineering was awarded the Gullfaks subsea wet gas compression project for Statoil. This represents the first subsea project of this nature in the world and builds on the unique technology position of Framo Engineering. ", "Let's now turn to the outlook where the main risk of a global double-dip recession appears to be behind us, although there are still uncertainties linked to the global financial markets and potential geopolitical events. In terms of oil demand, the 2012 outlook has also stabilized after a series of downward revisions in recent quarters. Based on the weakness of non-OPEC supply, OPEC spare capacity being at the 3-year low and supply risks from a number of sources, we do not expect oil prices to weaken significantly in the coming quarters. In the U.S., the production growth from unconventional gas, coupled with very mild winter weather, has driven storage to record levels. This has sent natural gas prices to a 10-year low and has led to a subsequent drop in gas activity, which is unlikely to recover in the near term. ", "In the international markets, natural gas and LNG prices remain solid and, based on the demand outlook, are unlikely to weaken significantly in the near term. In terms of our activity outlook for the year, we maintain our positive view on the international markets with rig count growth north of 10%, driven by the exploration and deepwater markets, as well as key land markets. With our strong focus in execution, a very solid contract base and a rich new technology portfolio, we are well prepared to capitalize on these trends. ", "In North America, the transition from gas to liquids-based activity will continue in the coming quarter, and the outlook for dry gas drilling activity remains uncertain. We still expect U.S. land rig activity to be in line with Q4 2011 levels provided the ongoing drop in gas rig activity continues to be offset by increasing activity in the liquids-rich basins. The other main uncertainty in North America is the evolution of pressure pumping pricing, which based on the ongoing transition, is set to continue down in the coming quarter. Still, our well-balanced service portfolio on land and our strong leverage towards the Gulf of Mexico puts us in a good position to outperform in the North America market going forward. ", "Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Paal. We\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Keeley?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of James West at Barclays.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Paal, I thought the change in your prepared commentary about international pricing was interesting, especially since you highlighted sentiments. Is this sentiment changes from your competitors who are now out of capacity and need to raise pricing? Or is it your customers who are pushing back less on price increases as technology and expertise becomes more important with rig rates moving up as quickly as they are? Or is it a combination of both?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think it's a combination of both, James. So if you want my perspective, bidding is always very competitive, whether we are at the peak or the trough of the cycle. Now the key to pricing trends is the sentiment, which is again driven by the view of activity outlook. And if you look at the activity outlook going back a couple of years, it's been under a constant cloud of uncertainty, whether it's natural disasters, geopolitics or the global economy, right? So even though there has not been too much overcapacity or a lot of overcapacity, there's still been a constant negative pricing sentiment. Now I think the industry is starting to realize, and we are certainly starting to realize, that in spite of the ongoing macro uncertainties, the tight supply and demand fundamentals gives a very solid basis for activity growth as we have seen consistently in 2010, 2011 and also now in 2012. So when you couple this fact with stabilizing GDP growth and also oil demand outlook, as well as tight service capacity in the industry, it really creates that positive pricing sentiments that I'm referring to.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. That's extremely helpful. And one of the offshore drillers mentioned yesterday there's been a big change in the last kind of 6 to 12 months around their customers' views of capacity. I assume that you're seeing that similar trend that your customers are now becoming -- I guess that sentiment would argue that the customers are becoming a little bit more concerned about the oil service industry's ability to provide the services they need for their programs.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I think that's fair. I think there are more concerns over capacity now. And like I said, there was never that much overcapacity. And I think whatever overcapacity was there, I think it\u2019s dwindling quite fast. We are actually quite tight in several of our product lines already. And I think it's also worthwhile to note is that over the past 2 years, most of the major international contracts have now been rebid. So there is now an opportunity to start raising prices on the smaller upcoming contracts, which we are in the process of doing, right? And then if you look at what's happening in rigs and seismic, typically there, the contract size is smaller. And that's why you can see them move quicker in terms of testing prices. With big multisegment, multiyear and multi-rig contracts like some of the big ones we are -- we have been bidding on over the past 2 years, you really don't want to be shut out. And I think that's where pricing on the large contracts has been very competitive and with that kind of slightly negative pricing sentiment. But I think most of those contracts are now either bid or even awarded, and there is now an opportunity to start raising prices on the smaller upcoming contracts without any significant risk.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of David Anderson of JPMorgan.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I thought it was very interesting in your release that you noted a number of reservoir enhancement projects, highlighting ESPs and Framo, a number of projects, and then again on the production management contract in Ecuador. Now investors typically associate Schlumberger with exploration, but you seem to really be gaining ground on the other end of the production curve. I was just wondering if you could help us understand how big a part of this business -- of this is your business now. And is this something we could potentially double over the next couple of years, considering all the mature production coming out of the IOCs?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "You're referring to these production incentive contracts, specifically?", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. But also to talk -- a lot of talk about Framo in there.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That's obviously a different kind of part of your business that we don't -- that seems to be getting highlighted more these days.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No. That's a fair question. So if I just take one step back. We have, for a long, long time, been very, very strong when it comes to Reservoir Characterization. And with these transactions we've done over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve also built a very similar position of strength in drilling. And our focus now from a portfolio standpoint in terms of further building portfolio is very much focused on the production side. So you are quite perceptive in picking that up. When it comes to the production incentive contracts, we see this as quite a strong growth vehicle for us going forward. This is why we created a separate product line focusing entirely on this. This part of our business was previously managed then under IPM and basically was a subset of IPM. So today it is not a significant part of our business, but it's probably one of the fastest-growing parts of our business. It is a new business model where some of the award -- some of the contracts are awarded, but quite a few of them are actually just negotiated straight without bidding in many cases. So it is one of the areas where we, as a company, can get the highest multiple on our services due to our strength in characterization, due to our strength in drilling and also due to our strength, which is now becoming even stronger, in production, right. So if that business can double over the next 3, 4 years, it can. It is still a relatively small part, but I would say it's one of the fastest-growing parts of our business.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. As a follow-up, I guess it's not quite related. But I just want to ask you about Argentina. Obviously, everybody's got a lot of questions down there in Argentina. You guys have staked out a big position down there. I think you've talked about doing 80% of frac stages. Can you just help us kind of walk through kind of some of the political risk and how you guys are navigating that? Does this -- what's happened in recent days, how does this change kind of your philosophy in terms of that market? Does it change your views on putting capital on the market? How are you thinking about this kind of new risk paradigm, I guess?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It's a fair question. So we have moved a fair bit of capacity into Argentina over the past 12 months, which actually I'm quite happy that we've done, because if you try to move capacity into the country now, you might be spending 12 months in customs or whatever. And so I think the key now is that we have a very strong position there. We haven't really changed our view on the potential or the resource base. That's absolutely there. Now with the government repealing the Oil Plus program [Oil and Refining Plus program] and also making import and export somewhat more challenging, there is some more short-term uncertainty. But we are still quite positive on the medium to long term of Argentina. And I think whatever way they are going to develop these resources, and they will, there's going to be a strong need for our expertise and for our products and services there. So I think at this stage, we continue to operate as we have been doing, but we have observed some of these political changes, right. But as of today, it hasn't really impacted our business.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "In other words, the work is still there. It's just you're going to be working for a different operator, essentially.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Potentially, yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Kurt Hallead at RBC.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Paal, my question is going to be focused -- I'll get it off the table here on North America and your outlook for the remainder of the year. And if you can maybe parse that between -- I know you mentioned pricing pressures in the frac market. Can you give us some color on what's going on in some of the other product and service lines? And can you also just help us understand maybe the margin progression in North America as it relates to, if you will, the frac and service components? Contrast that to Gulf of Mexico and contrast that to seismic. That would be very helpful.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. I'll have a go at that. So I think -- if we start off with North America land, the way I see it, we are facing 2 main uncertainties going forward, right. So the first one is the outlook for gas rig activity. Now with the record storage levels and natural gas pricing below $2, the drop in gas rig activities have to continue down from the current levels in the low 600. How low it's going to go? It is unclear at this stage. As the activity flow are supported by the lease commitment drilling in Paris [ph], is actually not that significant. Now on the other hand, the other main uncertainty is pressure pumping margins, which are under attack from several fronts. Firstly, utilization is likely to remain challenged because the lower well inventory leaves the frac fleets chasing the rigs much, much more than what we used to do 6 or 12 months ago. If you look at the bid pricing, it continued to drop in both gas and liquids during the quarter. On average, towards the end of the quarter in gas, we were bidding about 20% down sequentially and, in liquids, about 10% down sequentially on average between the liquids basins. Now in the first quarter, the new pricing started to significantly impact margins in the gas basins and in some of the liquids basins, while the rest of the liquids basins I see being impacted of the new pricing in the coming quarters. Now there's another key thing to realize as well, and that is that in the liquids, there are more stages per well. But the horsepower required per stage is actually much lower because we pump at lower pressures and lower rates. So while you need the fleet in liquids, you actually need fewer pumps or less horsepower -- or actually fewer pumps per fleet and less horsepower per fleet in the liquids, which again is going to contribute to the oversupply of horsepower. So if you add to these factors the fact that there is significant horsepower and order for the industry, we believe there is considerable uncertainty around the outlook for pressure pumping pricing and the margin. So the fact that it's coming down in Q2 I think is a given. And I think there's also significant uncertainty around H2, and it might come down further in H2. Now if you look at our side, we obviously are in the pressure pumping business, but we have the least exposure to this business if you compare us to our main competitors. And some of the other mitigating factors that we have done is that we have HiWAY within pressure pumping, and the off-take of HiWAY is going very well. We had another 25% sequential growth in the number of stages during the quarter. And we also introduced the Spark [ph] business model, which is then focused on the blending or lower pressure part of frac-ing. And obviously, as I said, we have significantly higher leverage towards wireline, logging and coiled tubing and drilling of land and also towards the Gulf. So I think, overall, there are issues around pressure pumping ,which is going to have an impact on the business, but we are quite well-leveraged towards other things which should give us an advantage going forward.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Very helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up to that and sticking just to the North America at this juncture, would you expect that when you take seismic in your Gulf of Mexico and what's going on with the frac market, when you roll that all together, margins coming down in aggregate for North America in the second quarter, do you expect the low point for margins potentially to be second, third quarter? Or do you think that given the negative momentum in the frac market, it\u2019s just going to drag margins down throughout the course of the year? What would be your best guess right now?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think, like I said, what is clear is that Q2 is coming down. And that's due to the fact that the -- there'll be more impact on the pressure pumping pricing and also we have the Canada breakup. Now what is going to happen in the second half of the year? I think that pressure pumping margins are going to continue to be under further pressure. Now to what extent we can offset this from seismic, from deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and from the other part of our land offering, which actually is holding up well in activity and actually holding up very well in margins, obviously, we have the ambition of trying to offset as much as possible of this. And now whether we're going to be able to do that is going to be a function of how severe the pressure pumping pricing and margin decline is going to be. And at this stage, I simply don't know.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Scott Gruber at Bernstein.", "Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I want to inquire about the impact of contract role internationally. Paal, you mentioned that the majority of the large contracts have been repriced. But are all of these contracts in force today, such that the negative role has passed assuming probably static pricing on future contracts?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I mean, there are still some contracts that are being evaluated and are going to be awarded. And I think the main of these are centered around Brazil and Petrobras. But I would say the majority of the large international contracts have been awarded, and they are already in effect, right. So most of the pricing concessions that have been given in the large contracts, I would say, are in our operations today.", "Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then can you provide some color on the revenue split internationally between these long-term contracts, whether it's for bundled or discrete services, the full IPM contracts and the shorter-cycle work? What's the broad split between those 3 buckets?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It's very difficult to give a number. But I would say that the large multisegment, multi-rig, even multiclient type of contract is, I mean, is centered in the certain parts of the world. You have -- obviously, you have Brazil. You have part of it in the Far East around the Pan-Malaysian contract, and you have some of them around the North Sea, right. So it is -- they are significant contracts for the markets that I was referring to, but it is only a part of our international operation, right. So we have -- there's a lot of other contracts. And if you look at the volume of work we have, for instance, for other NOCs and for independents and even other IOCs, that's still quite significant. So I can't give you a number. We put a lot of focus on it in our commentary because they are key kind of battlegrounds for pricing, but they\u2019re only a subset of our total contract portfolio internationally.", "Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. But it's fair to say that given that there's few awards coming out this year -- I think there's only 2 big tenders to be signed -- the shorter cycle work, the seismic activity, they're going to be a much more significant drivers in '12 versus repricing on big tenders?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think that's fair to say, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Paal, I see that you all are keeping your CapEx guidance flat at $4.5 billion for the full year. You've outlined here I think a modest bump in terms of your international rig count growth expectation for the year, and I know you're keeping a close eye in terms of North America pressure pumping capacity additions. Where do we stand right now in terms of maybe -- have we already seen the reallocation of capital from the North America markets to the international markets to start funding those opportunities you have there more fully? Or is that something we could still expect going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, first of all, Bill, there is no change to the rig count outlook for international. So I believe we said it's north of 10% in Q4, and we're saying north of 10% at this stage. So really no change to the activity outlook. International is coming in basically exactly the way we were foreseeing it, right. But when it comes to our CapEx, yes, we are upholding the $4.5 billion outlook. So in the Q4 call, what I said was that the budget or the plan was $4.5 billion, but we would look at the year in 2 halves. So in the first half, we would invest at 2011 levels, which is around $1 billion per quarter and then potentially ramp up of another 20% to 25% in H2 based on how things were going and also based on our view in 2013, right. So if you look at where we stand at the end of Q1, Q1 was at the planned rate of around $1 billion, and Q2 is going to be quite similar. The main change was that we halted the NAM pressure pumping additions, and we redirected this pressure pumping capacity or CapEx to the international markets, giving them their pressure pumping capacity earlier in the year. Now for the rest of the year, we're going to make a call on H2. Whether we actually go for this 25% ramp or not, we will make that call during the coming quarter. If I was going to do a preview, I would say that the NAM pressure pumping CapEx will likely be lower than planned. And any CapEx additions in North America for pressure pumping is likely to be more focused on the low-pressure blending part rather than on pumps, based on what I was referring to in my North American comments. While internationally, I think you could see a ramp further from the spending level now in H2, but within the envelope that we've already given.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And if you do go ahead and make the adjustments on the pressure pumping side in North America, Paal, would that be outright cancellations of capacity? Or would you just shift that in -- those deliveries into 2013?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we\u2019re already cutting in North America for pressure pumping, right. So we will see how much international wants to pick up from that. And the balance we will then either work with our suppliers. We'll see what we will potentially keep in inventory and basically manage that. But we have a very good dialogue and setup with our suppliers there. And I'm very convinced that we can manage that in a good way.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "One follow-up for you. As we look at certainly very good performance in margins in the first quarter, and everything I think you've outlined from a pricing and activity standpoint suggests margins just continue to improve here. I'm just curious of your thoughts as we continue to see mobilization of people and tools for you into these incremental opportunities in the deepwater contracts. Is there any expected margin drag you anticipate on your international businesses as a result?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No. I mean, there's always additional costs when you mobilize and start up new projects. But I mean, this is an ongoing business expense, and we have these type of costs on an ongoing basis, right? So we are focused on delivering steady international margin growth throughout 2012, right. And the starting point of this is really our focus on very strong execution. And I'm very pleased with what each part of the business has done so far this year in terms of very good cost and resource management. I'm also very pleased with the program that Smith and M-I is having, in particular internationally. They're doing very well both in terms of growth and in terms of margins. And then we have a very strong portfolio of new technology that we're introducing as well, right. So I think, overall, there are always added costs when you start up new projects, but this is part of ongoing business expenses and not something that should really impact our results.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert at Simmons & Company.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Continuing with the margin question internationally here. I mean, clearly, first quarter margins, at least for most of us, were better than expected. Flat quarter-on-quarter given the extreme seasonality in Northern Europe and Eurasia was impressive. Starting from a higher base than you did last year, for sure, but with regard to the road map for international margins over the course of 2012, you said steady improvement. Does that sort of convey the same order of magnitude of improvement that we witnessed last year Q1 to Q4? Or do you expect better than that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don't even remember what the -- what's really...", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "You were up 250 basis points from Q1 to Q4 of last year. You went from 16 to 19-and-change. You\u2019re starting at 19.", "Simon Ayat", "I'm sure you know that I'm probably not going to give you a number, right. But I would just go back to say that there is opportunity within how we execute with getting at least slight pricing -- I would say slight -- effective pricing traction maybe in the second half of the year for more of the activity mix, as well as from the sell-up of new or high-tech technology. So we have margin expansion potential during this year. Whether it's going to be 250 basis points or not, I'm not going to give you a number on that, other than we are working very hard, both through how we execute and also how we position ourselves for the new and upcoming contracts to drive margins up.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Two questions on seismic for you. Very positive commentary with regard to the outlook for pricing. On your bidding, you're up 10%. Do we actually start to get pull-through from that pricing improvement on your P&L second half of this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So what you have is for our upcoming work in Q2 and Q3, some of the work was bid last season, which is obviously on last season's pricing, right. But there is a part which is bid now. And more of that in Q3 than Q2, which is going to be at that higher pricing and then will have the pull-through that you're looking for.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay. And then last question on multiclient. Central Gulf of Mexico lease sale coming up here this summer. Did we see the benefit of that in the fourth quarter? Or do we expect to see the benefit of that in the second quarter predominantly?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, so first of all, we did not see it in the first quarter. I think we saw some of it in the fourth quarter. I think there is still some uncertainty around how much of a boost we're going to have in Q2 because the IOCs and the large players, many of them have already purchased data either to pre-commit to the service that we've done over the past 18 months and also from late sales that they did back in Q4. So in order for it to be significant in Q2, I think we need a lot more interest and activity or participation from the independents, which we so far haven't seen yet.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Michael LaMotte at Guggenheim.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Paal, I'm really kind of intrigued by the Spark [ph] model. And in particular, if I think about the contrast of bundling as a means of trying to create value, you\u2019re essentially dislocating the most commoditized and the horsepower. I'm wondering what -- 2 things, one, what that means for your margins kind of unlocking the big capital component, and two, sort of how far you think this model can go. Could we ultimately see horsepower in your view sort of going the way of even a rig market, being completely disassociated?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think it's a bit early to stretch it out that far now, right. I think we -- first of all, margin-wise for the Spark [ph] model, these margins are accretive to our pressure pumping business, and it\u2019s also quite attractive from a return on assets or return on capital standpoint, right. And that makes it quite interesting. Part of the reason for doing this is that we have seen a trend where some of our customers have started to vertically integrate on the pressure pumping side with quite limited ability to do any kind of sophisticated higher-end blending type and pumping more sophisticated fluid systems, right. So we, through HiWAY, have really the only significantly differentiated fluid system in the market at this stage. And that's why we see that as a very good fit with some of these more -- with some of these pressure pumping companies that are owned by our customers. So that's the starting point. How far it can go? I don't know. I think the main view I have or we have is that the pump itself is not a significant part of the pressure pumping operation. It's going to be much more the fluid or the engineered fluid system that is going to create -- that basically creates the conductivity downhole that drives the value proposition going forward, right. And I think this is why you see as soon as there is enough supply of pumps, the pricing goes down very, very quickly, right. So I think there is a chance to get a lot more sustainable pricing and performance in the pressure pumping business if your business is more centered around what really generates the value, and that -- as far as we see it, that is much more the fluid system than the actual pump.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. Totally unrelated follow-up, on the international gas side. Our view is that LNG prices are going to remain very strong for a very long time, which has obviously set off a scramble for exploitation of stranded gas, as well as redevelopment of more matured gas in places like Indonesia. I'm curious within the context of the 10% rig count growth, if you could give us a bit of a sneak peek into '13, what the bigger constraints are to seeing faster growth on the international gas front? Is it a rig constraint? Or is it at this point just about getting operators sort of focused on projects and queuing them up?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think it's a bit early for me to make a firm comment on that. We haven't looked at it in that much detail. But I would say that if it's conventional offshore, I think that there is no immediate, I think, shortcoming of rigs at this stage. I think it's more getting the projects lined up, right. But if you go more towards higher-end rigs, that might be constraint. But it's a bit early for me to comment on it in terms of 2013, I would say.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Maybe as a follow-up then, do you see more work coming from new basins such as a Mozambique or the sort of redevelopment of more mature provinces like Indonesia?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think we see both. I think the Far East with Indonesia, with Malaysia and Thailand is looking to be quite busy this year and going into next year. And obviously, there is significant focus on East Africa from an exploration standpoint. So I would say that both those regions and those type of developments in mature, more mature basins, as well as the newer basins are seeing good growth.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jim Crandell of Dahlman Rose.", "James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Paal, first question is in seismic. Given how pricing is improving and giving the contract outlook, do you think it's possible at this point for you to reach last cycle\u2019s peak margins at WesternGeco in 2013?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Again, I think it's too early to say. We are starting to see the signs of pricing traction, which we have been looking for, for the past 12 or 18 months, right. So capacity has tightened. If I look at the number of 3D vessels coming into the market scheduled for this year, which I think for the total market is only around 3, I don't see any issues with further capacity additions in terms of how it will impact pricing. So I think there are good chances of getting sustained pricing traction at least through this year, and then it's going to be a function of, I think, how much capacity is being added to the market, right. But the fact that margins are coming up is clear, but I think it's too early to say, yes, whether we\u2019re going to see the peak margins of the previous cycle. And I think multiclient activity is also going to play into that equation.", "James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up, internationally, particularly offshore, it seems to me as if one of your big competitors wants to have a higher market share in LWD, particularly in deepwater, particularly offshore. And I would argue that your other competitor wants to have a higher market share in wireline. You're a company that measures market share very closely. With pricing coming up, do you think you\u2019ve at least maintained your market share in both of those 2 businesses over the last year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I do. And I would say that international market share is really a function of the number of good contracts that you have, not the number of bad contracts. Also, international market is a function of how many contracts you retain and not necessarily how many contracts you win. So our contract portfolio today is very strong. There is significant upside potentially in terms of new technology, and this whole aspect of operational integrity and quality of service is still key market share drivers, right. And I've been quoting numbers about D&M replacement ratios in previous quarters. I think in Q4, this number was 31:5 that we replaced our competitors on rigs or wells or contracts, 31:5. And that number for Q1 is 30:3. So we continue to take work that our competitors might have previously won in terms of bidding, but they can't perform it, whether it's quality or capacity. And I think the other thing I would say is on -- that there is also an ongoing discussion about competitive pricing on deepwater and the margins we have there. I think the key -- if you want to look at how we have managed to maintain market share and maintain profitability, you need to look at our margin gap towards our closest competitor, which has expanded in the past year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Douglas Becker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "In the past, we've seen the share repurchase program characterized as aggressive and opportunistic. During the first quarter, it looks like the pace slowed considerably from what we saw last year. As we go through 2012, should we expect a less aggressive share repurchase program compared to 2011?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Simon, you want to answer that?", "Simon Ayat", "Yes. Okay. Well, thanks for asking the question. We obviously slowed down the repurchase program in Q1. Now I want to take advantage of this question to highlight our strategy on how we consume our liquidity. So after dividend, the cash is used for -- our first priority for the cash is really the business needs, and this is CapEx, the working capital when we have expansion and the small acquisition. And any excess cash, we will spend it on buyback. Last year, we did expand, if you want, beyond the excess cash because of following the acquisition of Smith and the number of shares we issued in that transaction. So we decided to be more aggressive in the buyback. You're going to see it more in our traditional way, which is basically avoiding the increase in the number of share due to the stock-based compensation schemes that we have. So it will be slower, yes.", "Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Makes sense. And then, Paal, recently, you announced an expansion of the core analysis capability in Houston. And I appreciate it's a pretty small part of the business, but can also generate very high returns. What role do you see core analysis playing in your business as you go forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, it's a key part of the Reservoir Characterization workflow, right. And we have, over the past 5, 6, 7 years, gotten further into that business. We have a great company up in Utah called TerraTek, which is leading in really high-end core analysis. And we've combined this with other parts of the company, as well as with our fluid analysis and some of the companies we bought there. And this is a key part of the characterization workflow. It is not a significant volume in terms of revenue, but like you say, it is higher-margin, and it's also a critical part of putting together that entire workflow and the entire, I would say, answer product to our customers.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mike Urban of Deutsche.", "Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Obviously, a lot of focus on the international pricing comments that you made. I wanted to take a little bit of different approach and talk about some of the other potential drivers of margin in the international business. In particular, I would think of things like mix of business as being a potential driver of margin and then also the volume. Now, you've talked about rig count, but are you also able to expand out of scope work and things like that as you grow into some of the infrastructure investments and some of the projects that are out there maturing? Just wondering if you can comment on those 2 items.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I think all those items that you're listing are key contributors to how we will drive margins, right, in addition to when we get pricing -- more pricing power. But the starting point for driving margins is very strong execution with respect to cost and resource management. We have a lot of focus within the company around leveraging our size and our footprint, even in a better way than what we have done in the past. We have a very strong international setup. And the way we run and conduct our business from a support standpoint from asset management, from maintenance and regional distribution of support activities, we have upside in terms of how that's run. And we are in the process of streamlining and upgrading how that's done. In other words, we will have a benefit to the bottom line, right. In addition to that, as I alluded to earlier, Smith and M-I is performing very well and continuing to improve margins under our international structure. We managed to lighten their support cost base. And also as they continue to grow, the flow through we can get on their business, even without pricing improvements, is actually quite good as well. And then like you say, the activity mix is favorable to us. Deepwater activity and exploration activity is highly accretive to our margins. And we also have a very strong portfolio in new technology. So I'm not going beyond what I said earlier in terms of how fast we can expand international margins, but we have potential to expand them, and we're working hard on getting that done.", "Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then in terms of some of the pricing improvements that you've talked about. Not so much on the large projects, which again, is still kind of competitive. But the shorter cycle stuff, smaller projects, how quickly will that flow through, just given some of the lead times that we typically see internationally? Is that something that could still materialize in 2012? Or is that a more material move next year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think you will have contracts where we will test pricing and likely win during this year. And we also -- when I refer to the wells or the projects or the contracts where we are replacing competition, we are obviously not replacing our competition on the same price as they bid at, right. So there will be some opportunities for smaller contracts with higher pricing. How quickly that's going to be material to the overall results, it's yet to be seen, right. But the fact that, that trend is starting, it will be a positive contribution.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Angie Sedita at UBS.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Paal, I mean, we discussed here with international pricing and a change of sentiment, one of your largest peers said that they are \"pushing for pricing\" on small to midsize projects. I mean, obviously, it's not only sentiment. It's what your competitors are doing. So are also seeing this in the marketplace? And if so, are you seeing this specifically in certain regions and product lines?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I wouldn't go into what regions we are seeing it. We are also testing pricing on smaller contracts. The main segments that we are seeing this in are the ones that are the tightest in capacity. Obviously, seismic, we already talked about. But then I would say wireline and drilling and measurements are the other ones where we are basically seeing this.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then given that North America is obviously flattening out and weakening and yourself and your peers are moving CapEx from the U.S. markets, the North American markets, abroad. Do you think there is -- or is there any risk that the international markets don't tighten further in 2013 if this CapEx moves abroad?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don't really think so. I think the main shift of capacity or CapEx would be around pressure pumping. And to what extent, I'm sure the other main or big integrated services companies is going to look at making sure that international operations get the right amount of pressure pumping capacity as well, right. Which over the past couple of years, at least we have been in many cases given priority to North America with [indiscernible]. So we are now getting back in and making sure we are properly set up in all the key basins where we need pressure pumping capacity. And I would say today, we are almost there. So in terms of how the international market is tightening, I don't think a shift from North America to international is going to be a significant problem because the activity level in North America is not really going down. The main issue you have is that there is oversupply of pumps.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "All right. Fair enough. And then finally, you also mentioned you are halting your capacity additions and pressure pumping here in 2012. What does that imply as far as when you'd stop seeing new capacity additions from Schlumberger? Is that Q3? Or is it still coming into Q4? Can you give us a little color there?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I can't give you the time because we will add back capacity when we can get utilization. I see really no point of adding capacity or pressure pumping capacity into the market now if I can't get the utilization, right. So it will be a function of when we can get that. And also, what I was saying is that the demand of pumps or horsepower in the liquids is going to be lower than what we had in the gas. So what we also can do is by investing and blending in low-pressure equipment, you can, in many cases, create more fleets out of the same horsepower in liquids than what you actually had in the gas, right. So our focus on CapEx in North America, if we need to add fleets, will be to add the low pressure part of a fleet and then basically use the existing horsepower first until we run out of that.", "Operator", "We have time for one more question. That will come from the line of Robin Shoemaker at Citi.", "Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Paal, I wanted to ask you -- going back to international side, in terms of the specific regional markets that may be holding back some of your margin progress, I\u2019d just like to highlight -- or ask you to highlight maybe a couple of those. I mean, I would start actually the first question with regard to Russia and how you see the evolution of that market, including potentially using higher-end technologies.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say -- first of all to your question about the overall margins. I would say that all parts of the business, I think, are doing a very good job in terms of how they execute and how they focus on both market share and margins in parallel. So that's the first point. But in Russia, specifically, we see very good growth in the Russian market for this year, in particular in Western Siberia. And just picking up on your point in terms of how higher-end technology can apply more there, I think what we're seeing in Russia is a continuous upgrade on the rig capability, more towards western standard and more towards higher-capacity rigs. And as you upgrade the rig base, the need for higher-end technologies that can drive efficiency will obviously and go up, right. So we are seeing a continuous, I would say, high-grading or upgrading of the rigs in Western Siberia. And with that, we will have a wider market for higher-end technologies. And what we have done over the past decade in Russia is that we have established a very solid footprint from the Russian companies that we have bought. And we have been continuing to use their locally made technology to have a deployment mechanism for higher-end technology when that becomes a requirement. So I would say that we are very well set up in terms of our footprint in Western Siberia, in particular through the Eurasia partnership and deal that we made last year. And with the continuous upgrade of the rig capabilities, the demand for higher-end technology is going to grow.", "Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then in your earlier comments, you mentioned an improvement in sentiment in Iraq, right, just quite recently. And so is the profitability level in Iraq likely to rise through the year as we get more -- as more rigs go back to work?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say that our overall profitability in Iraq, I think, for the past 2, 3 quarters has not really been an issue, and we continue to see that's not an issue. So we had a pause in the growth rate, and that was more down to uncertainty around the security situation as the U.S. Army left towards the end of last year. And also some concerns around the rate of new infrastructure, in particular, offloading capacity in the Gulf for Iraq production. So those were the sentiments that I was referring to that was turning positive towards the end of the quarter. And there is a number of contracts to be awarded and also started up, which I think a lot of it is going to take place during the second quarter. And beyond that, we see very strong growth going forward, and also, we see profitability being quite reasonable for us there.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call.

A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request.", "[Operator Instructions] And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.05. This is an increase of $0.09 sequentially and $0.19 compared to the same quarter last year.", "All prior period amounts have been restated, as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sale of Wilson and the sale of our investment in CE Franklin.", "Oilfield Services second quarter revenue of $10.4 billion increased 5.3% sequentially. Pretax income of $2.1 billion increased 8% sequentially, while pretax operating margins improved by 50 basis points.", "Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows: Second quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.8 billion, increased 7.4% sequentially, and margins grew 223 basis points to 28.2%. These improvements were driven by a seasonal rebound in SIS, combined with strong performances in Testing Services and Wireline. In fact, every technology in the group experienced sequential revenue growth and margin expansion.", "Drilling group second quarter revenue of $4 billion increased 5.7%, while margin improved 107 basis points to 18.4%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust international activity.", "Second quarter Production Group revenue of $3.7 billion increased 5.6% sequentially, while pretax margin fell 117 basis points to 16.4%. The revenue growth was led by Artificial Lift, Completions and Schlumberger Production Management. The margin decline was largely attributable to our North America hydraulic fracturing business as a result of the spring break-up in Canada and continued cost inflation and pricing pressure in U.S. land.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 24% in the second quarter compared to 23.6% in the previous quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for a full year of 2012 to be in the mid-20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business.", "Net debt at the end of the quarter was $6.7 billion as compared to $5.8 billion at the end of Q1. This reflected an increase in working capital requirements to support the current and anticipated business growth.", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.1 billion of CapEx, $681 million of acquisitions, $906 million of proceeds from the sale of the Wilson business and $499 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.52 million shares at an average price of $66.30. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011.", "And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. Second quarter results continue to strengthen, driven by a solid growth in activity and by consistent focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution.", "In the international markets, overall revenue grew by 9% sequentially, while margins were up by 161 basis points. Activity showed strong sequential growth, both offshore and in key land markets, while service capacity tightened further, in particular, in the areas of seismic, wireline and drilling services. We continued to test pricing on smaller contracts during the second quarter with good success, and for some customers, we also secured work at pricing premiums due to the quality and consistency of our performance.", "In Latin America, revenue grew by 5% sequentially, while margins were up by 79 basis points. We experienced strong growth in Mexico, driven by IPM activity on land and by our Wireline and Drilling product lines offshore.", "During the quarter, the second round of production incentive contracts were awarded, where we, in partnership with Petrofrac, won the contract for the Panuco block, covering 4 oilfields in the north of Mexico. In Ecuador, equity -- activity was up significantly as we started operations on the production incentive contract for the Shushufindi field. The project mobilization has been flawless, and the work program is progressing on schedule.", "In Brazil, activity remained flat during the quarter. However, a number of new rigs are being commissioned, and we are ready for activity to ramp up in the second half of the year as the rigs become operational. There are still a number of large bids outstanding, which will likely be awarded in the coming quarters.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially, while margins were essentially flat. During the quarter, we saw further growth in rig and rig-less activity in Saudi Arabia, and we also saw a noticeable pickup in activity in the United Arab Emirates.", "In Iraq, activity growth in the second quarter was limited as predicted, while we went through a very active bidding period. Building on the execution track record we have established in Iraq over the past 18 months, we secured most of the key new contracts awarded. Resources for the new contracts were successfully mobilized during the quarter, and we are positioned for good growth in Iraq in the second half of the year.", "In Asia, China posted strong sequential growth on land, driven in part by seasonal pickup in activity. We are also seeing increased demand for our high-end services, as well as for IPM, as our Chinese customers embark on more complex land projects for both conventional and unconventional resources.", "In Australia, we saw strong seasonal pickup in offshore activity in the second quarter. The offshore growth is set to continue in the second half of the year and be further complemented by additional land activity in Queensland and start-up of a new project in Papua New Guinea.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew by 14% sequentially, while margins were up 356 basis points, driven by strong activity and execution. The North Sea posted significant sequential growth, both on the U.K. and Norway side, with continued good exploration activity and strong growth in development.", "In Libya, activity continued to ramp up as new rigs became available, and we returned to double-digit profitability during the quarter. Sub-Sahara Africa growth was driven by high exploration activity in Mozambique and Tanzania, as well as strong exploration and development work in Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea.", "In Angola, activity remained more or less flat this quarter, but we expect both exploration and development projects to continue to ramp up during the second half of the year.", "In Russia, we saw seasonal pickup in activity, both in Sakhalin, the Caspian and Western Siberia. And based in the current outlook, Russia remains on track to be one of our fastest growing markets this year.", "In North America, sequential revenue was down 2% and margins were down 208 basis points. The results were impacted by the Canadian break-up and the U.S. land hydraulic fracturing market, but were partly offset by our other U.S. land businesses and by our activity in the Gulf of Mexico.", "In U.S. land, the overall rig count remained more or less flat, while rig moves from the gas basins to the liquids-rich basins continued. Pricing and activity for our Wireline, coiled tubing, and Drilling businesses in U.S. land remained stable. The impact of the Canadian break-up was in line with expectations, and the Canadian rig count was, at the end of the quarter, at the same level as last year.", "In the Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity grew in line with our outlook for the year and our operational performance remained strong and consistent, while multiclient sales were flat sequentially.", "As we predicted, the downward pricing trend in the hydraulic fracturing market continued in the second quarter and also spread to other liquids basins. During the quarter, hydraulic fracturing margins declined further as a function of lower pricing and higher product costs.", "Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, WesternGeco introduced the IsoMetrix technology, a new class of marine services that measures the wavefield in 4 components, using a new streamer called Nessie-6. The output data corresponds to towing conventional streamers less than 10 meters apart, turning a 12-streamer vessel into the equivalent of 144. The result is the industry's first real 3D seismic measurement, and the resolution of the data is like moving from a 2D X-ray to a 3D CAT scan. IsoMetrix will be able to extend the role of time-lapse 3D surveys, enable wider tow patterns that record superior data for exploration, as well as eliminating the need for dense streamer spreads.", "This summer, we will also release the latest version of our new reservoir simulation software, INTERSECT. Schlumberger has collaborated with Chevron for over a decade to build, test and deploy INTERSECT, and Total has recently joined the collaboration as a full partner. INTERSECT represents significant advances in physics modeling and use of parallel computing to better represent complex subsurface structures. It also includes a more advanced and comprehensive field management framework.", "In the Drilling Group, we introduced the NeoScope logging-while-drilling service, which eliminates the need for chemical sources by using pulsed neutron generator technology. The NeoScope service offers a full suite of sourceless formation evaluation measurements, as well as well placement and drilling measurements that help optimize the drilling process.", "During the quarter, we also bought the remaining shares of the Russian company Radius Service, after having been a minority shareholder for the past 7 years. Radius Service is the market leader in engineering, manufacturing and service of downhole motors and drilling tools in the Russian land markets, employing around 1,000 people and operating in all major oil and gas producing regions of Russia.", "In the Production Group, we introduced the Mangrove stimulation design software that enables better decision making for well completion and fracturing programs. The software helps optimize perforation and stage design for horizontal wells using reservoir measurements and also includes fracture network predictive models. Developed on the Petrel software platform, Mangrove users can access the shared earth model to facilitate program designs for all types of reservoirs, including unconventional resources.", "During the quarter, Framo Engineering secured another major contract, this time for the Shell Draugen Field in the North Sea. As the clear leader in subsea boosting and metering, Framo now represents one of our fastest growing business units, with around 75% annual growth in 2012 and with a backlog at record levels.", "Let's then turn to the macro-environment, where the continuing Eurozone crisis, coupled with the disappointing numbers from China and the U.S., has led to downward revisions of the outlook for GDP growth and oil demand. High production output from OPEC also led to a period of crude inventory buildup during the quarter, which, together with fares [ph] or lower demand, brought Brent crude prices briefly below $90 before recovering. At the same time, global spare capacity for oil is at the lowest level for 5 years and there continued to be risks of potential production disruption from geopolitical events.", "The situation in the global economy remains unsettled, and it seems increasingly clear that the present macro uncertainties will remain for a considerable period of time. In this environment, we believe Brent crude prices, in general, will be supported around current levels, although they could be subject to periods of considerable volatility. Continued macro uncertainty coupled with price volatility could make customers more cautious in terms of future activity plans. However, in the international markets, we have seen no signs of this so far. We maintain, absent a future significant setback to the world economy, our stated view that international activity will grow in excess of 10% this year.", "In North America land, liquids-based activity continues to grow, offsetting the drop in natural gas activity and keeping the overall U.S. land rig count more or less flat so far this year. However, a WTI oil price in the low 80s with continued market uncertainty could impact the rate of growth in liquids activity in the second half of the year, although we have not seen any signs of this so far. In terms of natural gas, we expect the U.S. dry gas rig count to level off around 500 rigs until the current production overcapacity is consumed.", "In the midst of the uncertainty, we maintain our focus on what we control, which is the planning and execution of our work. To further extend our leadership in execution, we are currently undertaking a number of multiyear programs that cover a wide range of internal and external activities. These, together with our international strength and our balanced portfolio in North America, should enable strong relative performance going forward.", "Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Paal. And we'll now open the call for questions. Kathy?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So my question here really relates to very good sequential improvement in North America, despite the significant headwinds in the frac market as well as the seasonal downtick in Canada. Gulf of Mexico was flat. Seismic didn't really contribute much. So really, I was surprised by the strength of your other businesses in U.S. land. And given your outlook for the second half of the year, do you think it's reasonable, even in a flat rig-count environment, that Schlumberger can continue to show sequential improvement in the back half of the year, both in revenues and margins in U.S. land? And can you give us a little bit more color around what's really driving that improvement?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, just to clarify, the Q2 performance, we had very good performance in the Gulf of Mexico, the rig-related businesses, while the multiclient sales were more or less flat with Q1. So I would say that the Gulf of Mexico had a positive impact on the overall results, while multiclient sales were basically flat. Now we also had steady activity in pricing in the Wireline and Drilling businesses on U.S. land, while the Canada break-up impact came in as expected. So the main downwards pressure we saw in addition was the continued pricing and cost challenges in hydraulic fracturing. So whether the nonperformance from our side on U.S. land is sustainable, I think it's too early to say. I think it's going to be mainly a function around what the rig count is going to be. I think it's very clear that the hydraulic fracturing margins are going to continue down in Q3. We are still bidding lower in the liquids basins as of today. So if you look at it, both liquids and gas pricing is now about 20% down from the peak, and quite a few of these contracts have not yet been implemented. So I would say the liquid -- the margins in hydraulic fracturing is coming down. And to what extent we can offset that will obviously be a function of continued activity in the Gulf of Mexico, and we are heading into the hurricane season, which also brings some uncertainty. So we're obviously well positioned to offset the hydraulic fracturing, but to what extent we can do it is still a bit uncertain.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And you had some significant great performance in Europe, Russia and Africa. It seems like it was pretty evenly distributed. In the second half of the year, you've mentioned that Russia is going to be your fastest growing market. How would you characterize the North Sea and Africa relative to Russia as you head into the back half of the year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I said that Russia -- as we indicated at the beginning of the year, we had identified Russia to be one of our fastest growing markets. What we said was that within ECA, sub-Sahara Africa offshore and the North Sea offshore would be significant growth drivers. We continue to see them as strong growth drivers in the second half of the year. And at the same time, in ECA, we had North Africa land and Russia land generally as strong growth drivers as well, and we maintain those views. Now all these growth outlooks and expectations, we have to tie in this whole, overall macro uncertainty, as I mentioned in my prepared notes. But overall, the market progressed in Q2 as we were expecting in the international market, and ECA, I think, did slightly better than what we were expecting.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James West with Barclays.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, I wanted to ask you a question about one of the comments you made towards the end of your prepared statements. You were talking about, I guess, in the press release and your comments, about the solid execution for the quarter, which was pretty obvious in the numbers. And you highlighted additional actions to really extend this leadership position. You already have, of course, industry-leading margins in North America, it looks like now, and of course internationally. And I'd like, I guess, if you could perhaps elaborate on what these both internal and external actions may be, and if possible, what kind of additional leadership that could add to your margin profile.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I'll give you a brief outline of what they are. So generally, they are focusing on both operational quality and operational efficiency. So I think we mentioned earlier that we've had a strong focus on the quality of operations now for a number of years. Actually, we started this Excellence in Execution initiative back in 2008, driving quality. And if you look at our nonproductive time in our worldwide operations at this stage, we are now about 50% down compared to where we were when we started off back in 2008. And this is driven by the engineering and manufacturing of our products and making these more reliable. It's also driven around the investment in training and competency management and also a very strong focus on project preparation and process discipline. What we have augmented this Excellence in Execution drive with recently, or more recently, is the initiatives around operational efficiency or cost management, right? So this revolves around global supply chain and category management. We have a significant part of our organization occupied with shared services and transactional activities, and also things around asset utilization and global distribution. So all these elements, given our size and our footprint and our reach, represent a significant part of our cost base. And by driving efficiency even in small percentages with such a sizable organization, has a direct -- quite a meaningful impact to the bottom line, right? So -- but I would say that most of these or all these projects are multiyear projects, and you will see gradual impact over time.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, okay, that's very helpful. And then just one follow-up on the pricing side. You elaborated on gaining some pricing traction in the market and getting a premium for some of your services. Did we see the benefits of that in the second quarter? Is that going to be second half and '13? So I guess what I'm asking is, is there more margin uplift from pricing coming?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we saw some impact of, I would say, international pricing in the quarter, right? So I indicated in the Q1 call that we saw pricing sentiment starting to turn more positive. And I think that trend continued during the second quarter, also driven by strong growth in activity, which leads to further tightening of capacity. We continue to test pricing on these smaller contracts with actually quite good success rate during the second quarter. And also, we saw more technology sell-up within the existing contracts, which has a quick fall-through to the bottom line within the current quarter, right? I would say the other key thing that we observed during this quarter is that the high offshore rig rates and in projects with tight project schedules, we see our customers elevating their focus on operational excellence and willingness to actually pay for it, right? And this enabled us, in some cases, to win contracts at very good pricing premiums due to the quality of our performance. So Q2 was a step in the right direction, provided that the macro uncertainty doesn't have a negative impact going forward. I think it's reasonable to believe that this could continue into the second half of the year.", "Operator", "We'll go next to Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Paal, I have to just get a little bit more color on that very last thing you said there, win contracts with -- despite considerable pricing premium. Could you just elaborate a little bit? Is this -- how wide and what technologies? And where do you see this ability?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, in the contracts where we manage to secure a contract at pricing premiums, a lot of this has -- revolves around, I would say, Wireline and the Drilling segments. So this is -- in terms of the number of them, I mean, it's not prolific around the world yet. But at least we see a correlation between higher rig rates and more focus on operational excellence from our customers, where the actual pricing they pay for our services versus the negative impact of poor performance from the services they buy, they put a lot more focus on that.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Whereabouts -- any geographic nature to this? Any area where this is more common?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Now, you would typically see this in highly complex offshore type of operations around the world...", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "[indiscernible] your competitors make some very aggressive claims with respect to market share gains, whatever. Are we seeing certain competitors not being able to perform? Is that it, people are out of capacity and not able to execute what they have taken? Or are there other reasons?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I don't know what the drivers behind their results, but I would just say that we continue to replace our competitors on key projects and on key rigs. So this whole focus around operational integrity and quality is, I would say, is now become quite a significant market share driver. So we've been quoting this D&M replacement ratio number over the past couple of quarters. And that number, again, this quarter, was 39 to 6. So we replaced our competitors 39 times. We were replaced 6 times. So that ratio is maintained. And I would say that the driver behind that is being able to perform within the contracts that you initially win. So the key is to win the contract on reasonable pricing to allow you to invest and perform. That's really the only way to maintain the contracts in the international market.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And you're doing that with incremental pricing power?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Oh, yes, we are not going in to replace our competitors at their pricing or at the average pricing. We need a premium to do that.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just then to my real question, which was actually more about North America. Did you get helped sequentially by multiclient sales or any other kind of factor that artificially -- not artificially, but more one-off type kind of goosed up your North America margins?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, multiclient sales in North America were flat sequentially. So we had strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico in terms of the deepwater operations overall. And that obviously helped, but it wasn't -- there wasn't a significant boost. We were hoping to see a significant boost around the June lease sales. That did not really materialize. So multiclient sales were flat sequentially. So there weren't really anything exceptional in North America this quarter.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then finally on IsoMetrix, I mean, you're creating quite a stir in the industry now with this technology. Can you talk a little bit about the testing phase implementation of this technology adoption? I presume given this is, I think, the biggest R&D project in the history of Schlumberger, you want a big -- you want to be paid for it. So what do you think the customer willingness will be to pay up for something that is traditionally viewed as a commodity?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, it's a bit early to say what they're willing to pay for. You're right in saying that this is one of the biggest engineering projects we have undertaken as a company. And with those kinds of investments and with the value that this technology is going to bring, we obviously want to be paid a fair price for that in relation to what value it brings. So our plan for this year is that we are going to run one vessel with the IsoMetrix streamers on -- or the Nessie-6 streamers on, and then we will do a ramp-up next year. We haven't really finalized the plan for CapEx investment in this for next year, but I'm quite confident that we are going to be able to get a good pricing premium on this technology in the market.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons Company.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Continuing with the seismic theme, Paal, positive outlook extolled by everybody and yet the WesternGeco backlog was flat quarter-on-quarter. How do we reconcile those 2?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don't think our backlog was flat.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "It was flat to up. It wasn't up markedly, I don't think, I mean, perhaps -- yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Well, I don't really have any specific comment on the backlog other than we maintain quite a positive view on the outlook for the market. If you look at the Q2 results, they were pretty much in line with what we were expecting. We took the opportunity to reposition some of our vessels and also to do some dry dock maintenance of them. But beyond that, utilization was quite good. Looking forward to Q3, we are now fully sold out, and we're actually also already 60% booked for Q4. So the main question mark this year has actually been, \"Are we going to avoid the seasonal lull that we typically get in Q4?\" And at this stage, I think we have a reasonable chance of avoiding that with being so much booked already.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Great. And then were -- was seismic, in the second quarter internationally, was it additive to margins, to overall international margins in Q2?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We don't really give details of this, right? So I would just say that the -- there was a good progression of seismic performance between Q1 and Q2. But in terms of specifics on margin and percentages, we don't disclose that.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "But that should continue in the third quarter, especially with a strong North Sea season and also beginning to get traction on your P&L with regard to pricing. I mean, is that fair?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think that's fair, yes.", "Operator", "We now have a question from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.", "James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Paal, I'd like to ask a different question about the seismic business. Is -- how far out can you see now for tightness in marine seismic supply, demand? What is this meaning to pricing currently? And then -- so the last piece of that is, what are your plans in terms of adding new marine vessel capacity to the market?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Well, if you look at our visibility in terms of bookings, beyond Q4 we don't really have any clear visibility on how the quarters are going to shape up. But I would say this year looks strong. If you look at the total market of high-capacity vessels today, total market is around 62, out of which WesternGeco has 16. So we are seeing that there is overall new-build from several of the players, of which we have 2 new-build vessels coming online in 2014. So our view on new-builds is twofold. We will add capacity if we can get the needed utilization. But we also have a vessel replacement program, which is basically retiring some of our older vessels and replacing them by new higher capacity ones, right? So depending on where we are in 2014, when the these new vessels are becoming available, we will make a call on actually whether we extend the life of the ones that we have or we actually retire them and maintain capacity flat. So it's all about ensuring utilization in marine seismic. And beyond that, we obviously want to make sure that we capture some of the upside of activity, if that was to materialize. But at this stage, I would say that we have a positive view on this year, and provided that there's no dramatic change to the overall market, that should spill into 2013 as well, most likely.", "James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "How is pricing on new contracts, Paal, for -- that you've been able to sign for start-up in Q3 and Q4?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Pricing is similar to what I said in the Q1 call. We are bidding more or less 10% up year-on-year. You will still find in Q3 that you'll have a mix of contracts bid last year and contracts bid this year, right? So you won't have that full 10% impact on the P&L, but overall again positive sentiments on seismic.", "James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just my follow-up question, Paal, is you and particularly others have mentioned the price competitiveness of the deepwater LWD and Wireline markets. And, I mean, it's ironic to me, in a way, that the segment offering the highest technology should be among the most price competitive parts of the market. Can you see this changing over the second half of the year with even more new rigs starting up? Or do you think that this, I don't know, could be the new norm for the couple years, that this segment is just going to be highly price competitive because, maybe, of the desire of some of your competitors to maintain/increase market share?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I wouldn't generalize competitive pricing in the overall deepwater market. If you look at our position in the deepwater market, whether it's for Drilling & Measurements or Wireline, this is where we have the highest pricing and the highest margins of these type of businesses. So in some of the large contracts revolving around this, there might be quite competitive bidding. But overall, our deepwater business for both of these segments is highly accretive to our margins.", "Operator", "We now have a question from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Paal, I just want to circle back again on the -- to see if you could put some context around the small contracts comment internationally, and maybe just, for us, what that means for Schlumberger as we think about these contracts kind of as a percentage of your revenue internationally, because I think the market really focuses a lot on the large competitive bid tenders. But my understanding for you is that, really, that's a relatively small part of kind of the international global picture, if you will, in terms of from a revenue contribution. So I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about the smaller contracts and how that affects your revenue stream. And also just talk about, within this pricing comment, do the contracts, typically on these smaller contracts -- are they shorter term in nature internationally than what is typically believed as being 2, 3-year type contract terms in the international market in general, so you get quicker terms on these smaller contracts as we think about pricing escalation opportunities in future quarters?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if we start off with the first part of the question. The large contracts, as you say, or the ones that have been quoted in previous quarters, they make up, I would say, less than 20% of our overall contract volumes. So they are significant in terms of their size and duration, and they're often very strategic to secure. But as an overall part of the volume, it is not that big, so -- which means that it's the smaller contracts that make up more of a significant part of our international portfolio. The duration of these contracts vary a fair bit. It could be one well; it could be one project. So it's a bit difficult to quantify exactly what the average here is, right? But generally, they will be multiyear, typically, unless you're just bidding for one particular exploration well.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess maybe this question is for Simon, just is a question on Geco. It's been for several quarters since you all have broken out what the revenue contribution is in absolute terms from Geco. I think the last time you guys were reporting on a quarterly basis, it was running on an annual basis somewhere in that $2-billion to $2.5-billion range. I mean, still given just the tailwinds in that business and the optimism around it, are you all able to size for us, Simon, where that revenue stream kind of stands right now for Schlumberger as a whole?", "Simon Ayat", "Well, you can assume that it is growing slightly. It is more or less what you mentioned, but the growth is reflective of the rest of the business, yes.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And you'd say it's probably growing at a higher rate -- a higher top line rate than maybe some of the other businesses.", "Simon Ayat", "It is higher than some of the other businesses, but overall, it's reflective of what we are experiencing with the Oilfield Services.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And, Paal, I wanted to follow up on your -- you've mentioned uncertainty a few times with respect to outlook, and yet when I think about the volume of business in the second half and even into early '13 that's offshore, you've got pretty long-term commitments in terms of operator commitments to the rigs. Can you, perhaps, clarify what you mean by uncertainty? Are you really speaking to black swan event, something like we saw in '08, or something more -- a more marginal degradation?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think it's all relative, right? I would just say that the -- in the event there is a significant event in the global economy, whether that is linked to China or Europe or it could be geopolitical, that could have an impact on -- even on shorter term activity, if cash flow comes into question. But I agree with you. In international markets, a significant part of the contract base is longer term and generally should be robust. But we saw significant volatility in the second quarter in terms of the global markets. And that volatility could bring some more caution into some of the -- some of how the operators, how they plan to go forward with activity. Now we have not seen any signs of change or any difference in plans versus what we had a quarter ago. But I think there is significant market uncertainties in the global market, and I think it's just prudent to point that out.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And the Excellence in Execution, help me delineate down 3 tracks in terms of what you're doing on internal processes with respect to procurement and supply chain management. There's also the focus on field efficiencies through the asset-light model and even selling and leasing queue as opposed to using your own crews. And then the technology route, like the highway or if we go back in time, something more like Platform Express, where I'm going with this is perhaps if you could maybe allocate what you think in terms of contribution by each of those 3 buckets and give us a sense as to whether this is really something that can continue over time, or whether it's something that's going to be quite lumpy and dramatic in one period and then stabilize and stair-step.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say all 3 elements, whether this is, like you say, technology -- I mean, technology has always been a key part of how we generate value and how we [indiscernible]. And the 2 other ones, which are more the shared services and supply chain part, as well as the field operation and utilization, the latter 2 has, I would say, still significant upside given the size of our global operations. So these multiyear programs I'm referring to, I believe they will be meaningful over time. But they're not going to have any dramatic quarter impact this quarter or next quarter or so forth, right? It's going to be part of a continuous improvement process where we put a lot more focus, and I would say scientific approaches, into some of the other parts of the company rather than just the technology that we develop and that we deploy for our customers. So there is significant upside in terms of how we run as a company for those internal aspects. And these are initiatives and programs that we are going to be carrying forward for the next 3, 4, 5 years, and they would have a gradual impact in terms of our results.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So it sounds pretty uniform across all 3, if I could sort of rephrase it. And the kind of trend that we've seen, which suggests 150 plus or minus basis points per annum, is reasonable to assume going forward.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I'm not going to give you any margin other [ph] than [indiscernible]. You knew that, didn't you? But I would say that we are continuously focused on driving our margins up, whether that is pricing, technology or these other efficiency programs.", "Operator", "We have a question from David Anderson with JPMorgan.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A question on Latin America. Paal, you guys seem to be in a really great position relative to your competitors down there. Just hoping you could help me understand a little bit more about the growth opportunities you see evolving over the next 12 to 24 months. I guess, there's 3 areas in particular -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's 3 main areas for you guys. First is production management contracts. You just announced another one starting up in Ecuador and the Mexico contract. Second would be Brazil, kind of how the pre-salt is evolving and all the contracts letting out. And the third would be Argentina. Obviously, what's going on with YPF and kind of the uncertainty around there. Could you just kind of address those 3 areas for us and how you see them evolving, please?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, sure. So I can take you quickly around the main countries there, right? So if you look at Mexico, I think Mexico has, so far this year, been one of the main drivers for Latin America for us. And going forward, we see further rig additions on land and shallow offshore in the second half of the year. Pemex is evaluating the Eagle Ford south extension as well and there are some both shale gas and shale oil pilots upcoming there, and we are engaged there with our shale workflow. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we also won the Panuco block, together with Petrofrac, in the second round of production incentive contracts. So overall, Mexico, with both the IPM activity, the individual products and services we do with Pemex, as well as these production incentive contracts, provides a very strong basis for growth and performance going forward. If we jump to Brazil, we see deepwater rig counts growing in the second half of the year. It's been relatively flat-ish in both Q1 and Q2, as a number of new rigs were arriving and being commissioned. So there's still, I would say, strong growth likely to take place in Brazil in the second part of the year. And a key, again, in Brazil is going to be linked to the outcome of these significant bids that are still under evaluation from Petrobras. In Argentina, we also maintain, I would say, a good activity outlook, driven by both the shale gas and shale oil, as well as on the conventional. There's some short-term uncertainty as the situation around YPF settles, but I would say that medium to longer term, our view on Argentina is still positive. And then the other one that we -- I think you referred to is Ecuador, where we are very pleased with how the start-up of the Shushufindi SPM project has progressed. And the activity in Ecuador, both on this project, Shushufindi, as well in the general market there, is going to continue to ramp up in the second half.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "If I could just go back to Brazil. Have you seen much of a change in how Petrobras is going about their business with a new CEO, Gra\u00e7as Foster, in place? I mean, is there a sense that pricing might be getting a little bit better? Is there a sense that maybe technology is going to be more of a focus? What are you seeing out of them, kind of late -- over the last 6 months or so?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I wouldn't say that there has been a significant change in how they go about doing their contracting. I would say that is generally because most of these bids have been in process throughout that period, right? So if there's going to be any change, I would expect that to maybe be in the next round of things, although they haven't really indicated anything. So I think the way they're going about their business in this bidding round is similar to what they've done in the past.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So really no change in pricing. Pricing still kind of challenged right now. You're hoping to get in there, show them -- show you can do the performance and hopefully the next round, you get better pricing. Is that the strategy?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we always, in any bid that we submit, we will bid it at the level that we can make the contract into a productive contract for Schlumberger and our shareholders. So there's a plan of how we can perform within the contract in terms of execution. And also, we have a very rich technology portfolio in terms of what we will introduce over the next coming years. And some of these Petrobras contracts could be off to, what, 6 to 8 years, right? So there's a significant new technology component of these contracts as well going forward.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And these bids, you're expecting to be awarded -- is it third quarter time frame for some of these bids?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, Petrobras hasn't really given us any timeline, so we will await when they announce.", "Operator", "We now have a question from Nigel Browne with Macquarie.", "Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research", "I just had one question, more product related. I wanted to know in terms of North America and internationally how impactful was your Artificial Lift and rotary steerable product line? And then, following on that, what is your estimation about the penetration of rotary steerable drilling systems in North America versus some of the more conventional techniques?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we don't really provide details of -- by segments. If you look at Artificial Lift, that is part of the Production Group. So really, the only detail I can refer you to is the Production Group results. And furthermore, we don't provide specific details around technologies as well, and rotary steerable being one of them. I would say, though, on rotary steerable in North America, our new PowerDrive Archer technology, which we have introduced recently, has been, I would say, tailor-made for the North America land market with the high build rate that it can provide. So I would say that the penetration of rotary steerable in the North America land market, at the back end of that technology, should go up from our side. But beyond that, I won't be able to provide you with any more details.", "Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research", "Okay. But even anecdotally, are you seeing any sort of leading indicators or queries around electric submersible pumps in North America at all?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "On land?", "Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research", "Yes, on land.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "On land, generally, there are other type of pumps employed in the North America land market, if you're referring to unconventional, not really ESPs.", "Nigel Browne - Macquarie Research", "Okay, so it's still a rodless market predominantly.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Predominantly, yes.", "Operator", "We now have a question from Doug Becker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Paul, you reiterated your expectation that international activity would grow in excess of 10%. If we take a look at the Baker Hughes rig count, it's implying a first half increase of around 5% year-over-year. Just trying to get a sense, is this consistent with a very aggressive ramp in the second half of the year? And is that Schlumberger's expectation? Or is there just a measurement difference in what you're looking at versus the Baker Hughes rig count?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think it might be a slight measurement difference. I think you'll see that the offshore rig rate will be, at least the way we see it, will be up more than what the land rig rate -- sorry, land rig count is, right? So you will have more growth in offshore versus land. And the impact of the offshore is, obviously, significantly higher to our -- both our revenue and our margins, right? So I think you need to break it down to offshore and land.", "Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Makes sense. And since we have pretty good visibility into the offshore rigs, I mean, is there a potential that this significant ramp in the offshore rigs, we finally see the scales tipping in favor of the service companies for pricing power? Or is it because this growth is pretty well anticipated, still the slow grind higher?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, as I was referring to earlier, there is a tie between higher rig rates and more focus on operational excellence in the way our customers select their providers. So I would say that higher rig rates tied to utilization will potentially create more potential for us to raise prices and to get some of the value back for the strong performance that we deliver.", "Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then switching to Europe, Africa, CIS. I just want to get some sense for the sustainability of revenue and margins there. A very strong quarter. I haven't heard anything that would suggest that we should see any type of pullback in the third quarter. I guess execution is always an issue. But is there anything that would suggest the second quarter revenue and margins aren't a good base to be thinking about going forward in Europe, Africa, CIS?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I would just say, with the exception of the overall macro caveat that I've referred to a couple of times, there is nothing exceptional in the results of ECA this quarter. So if the activity remains on track the way we have predicted it during the year, this should potentially continue in the second half of the year.", "Douglas L. Becker - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Are there still synergies associated with the Eurasia, I guess I'll call swap? Or have those largely been realized at this point?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, the overall integration of what we received versus what we sold is more or less done, so that part of synergies and the transaction is done. The other part of this is that this has given us access to significantly more land rigs in Western Siberia, to the point that we are extremely busy on land in Western Siberia, and we are actually struggling at this stage to have enough capacity to serve all the rigs. So there is still, I would say, performance upside surrounding the transaction we did with Eurasia as we continue to ramp up to cover all of their rigs.", "Operator", "We have a question from Robin Shoemaker with Citi.", "Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I want to ask about the investment you made recently in Anton Oilfield Services as a strategy for China. But more broadly, in what countries or markets you think that having stake in a local service company is the route that -- one of the major routes that you'll use to grow in that market?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if I attack the second part of the question first. I think in the high-volume markets, the key high-volume markets around the world, there is often a benefit of owning or having interests in local companies, mainly because they know the local conditions, and in some cases they have technologies that are more custom made for the local environment, right? And we have some of these companies in North America. We got them with the Smith transaction. We have, over time, acquired a number of these types of companies in Russia. And we have now taken a stake in this company in China.", "Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. So let me just switch my other question back to North America. In terms of -- I think most of your fleets are -- your fracturing fleets are working in the term market as opposed to spot contracts. But is there a tendency over time for fewer term contracts to be signed, more fleets working in the spot market? And is there a level of pricing at which you would idle -- have -- prefer to have your fleets idle as opposed to working in -- at very low spot market rates?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, so today, we operate roughly around 80% in terms of term contracts. The remaining 20% will generally be fleets that are in between, I would say, in between work. So generally, at this stage, we'll be happy to go more or less to 100% term contracts the way it is set up. Is there a limit as to what pricing we would take on? I would say that we are not really in the business of taking on loss-making contracts. So that's where generally we would draw the line at this stage.", "Robin E. Shoemaker - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And do you have any idle fracturing fleets in North America now, or purposely or due to market conditions?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at what we've done in North America, we have completed the repositioning of our fleet and we have stopped further CapEx additions. And what we have done in addition to that, we have parked the excess pumps that we have at this stage. And the reason why we have excess pumps, we're not running fewer crews than what we did 3 or 6 months ago. But with the continued transition of activity from the dry gas basins to the liquids, the number of horsepower needed on a liquids job is significantly lower than what you need on a dry gas job. And that's why you -- while you run the same number of crews, you will have actually excess horsepower. And that's really what's driving the oversupply in the markets. So we have parked those pumps because we have no need for them.", "Operator", "And our final question will come from Michael Urban with Deutsche Bank.", "Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "On the international side, good rundown of a lot of the markets, and it seems like most international markets are strong, if not accelerating. Are there any markets out there that are still weak or underperforming or maybe not where you'd like them to be?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "In the international market?", "Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, not really, nothing that stands out. I think we have -- we see good performance versus the overall plan that we put in for this year throughout, more or less. So no, there's nothing that really stands out.", "Michael W. Urban - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Great. And then finally on Russia, specifically, you've highlighted it as a very good market for you, and it seems like you're continuing to invest in the market. Are you -- is that more a function of just the higher volumes and the higher activity levels you're seeing? Or are you beginning to see better technology uptake there? I kind of think of Russia as maybe a little bit more volume driven, lower technology, perhaps with exception of things like Sakhalin.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think, historically, you're right. And largely in the Western Siberia land market, it is relatively low technology or local technology still today. But there is -- I would say there is a continued drive to upgrade some of these land rigs to higher capacity. And this provides a lot more opportunity to deploy more high-end technology, right, so -- which for instance, the transaction with Eurasia, where we have significantly opened up the rig footprint that we have available to us, as the technology needs grows on these rigs that they over time get upgraded, that is again a significant opportunity for us to drive [indiscernible] deployment on the, I would say, the basic footprint of Russian technology that we have acquired over the past decade.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I'd like to thank you for participating in today's call. Kathy will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10:00 a.m. today through midnight August 20.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Julie. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. Joining us on the call from New York City today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the frequently-asked-questions document, which is available on our website or upon request.", "We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements. [Operator Instructions]", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.08. This is an increase of $0.03 sequentially and $0.12 compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, all prior-period amounts have been restated as the Distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations following the sale of Wilson in the second quarter and the sale of our investments in CE Franklin during the third quarter.", "Third quarter revenue of $10.6 billion increased 1.5% sequentially. This increase was driven by international revenue growth of 3.1%. The international growth was offset in part by 2.3% decline in North America. Oilfield Services pretax income of $2.1 billion increased 2% sequentially while pretax operating margins were essentially flat.", "Sequential revenue and pretax margins highlights by products groups were as follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $2.9 billion increased by 4.8 percentage points sequentially, and margins improved 58 basis points to 28.8%. These increases were driven by improved reservoir utilization at WesternGeco, following last quarter's transits and dry docks, as well as a strong international performance in Testing Services.", "Drilling Group third quarter revenue of $4 billion increased 1.2% while margins declined slightly by 34 basis points to 18.1%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to Drilling & Measurement on robust activity in the Middle East and Asia.", "Third quarter Production Group revenue of $3.7 billion decreased 1.7% sequentially while pretax margin fell 148 basis points to 14.9%. These declines were largely attributable to our North America hydraulic fracturing business, as we continue to experience pricing pressure in U.S. land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower capacity in the market.", "From a geographical perspective, North America margins declined by 209 basis points to 18.6% while international margins improved 73 basis points to 21.5%.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.6% in the third quarter compared to 24% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $6.2 billion as compared to $6.7 billion at the end of Q2. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.1 billion of CapEx, $121 million of proceeds from the divestiture of our investments in CE Franklin and $149 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares at an average price of $68.19.", "In addition, during the quarter, we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $1 billion of 1.25% of 5-year notes due in 2017 and $1 billion of 2.40% 10-year note due in 2022. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $4.5 billion in 2012 as compared to the $4 billion we spent in 2011.", "And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continue to show steady improvement in both revenue and margin performance as seen in the overall pretax operating income, which was up 2% sequentially and 11% compared to the same quarter last year.", "In the international markets, total revenue grew by 3% sequentially, in line with the rig count while margins were up by 73 basis points, reaching a 3-year high. Activity was solid, driven by both key land and offshore markets. However, regional growth rates continue to vary, driven by changes to activity mix and project schedules.", "Service capacity remained tight in our Seismic, Drilling & Measurements and Wireline product lines, and we also saw signs of capacity tightening in our Well Testing business. Pricing continued a steady upwards trend during the quarter, driven by higher new technology sales, strong operational performance and further supported by proactive bidding on small- to medium-sized contracts.", "In Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially while margins were down 113 basis points, driven by a shift in activity mix, operational delays and heavy mobilization costs linked to new contract startups.", "In Mexico, activity remained steady during the quarter with continued focus on deepwater exploration, conventional offshore development and mature fields on land. We start operations on our -- in our first Schlumberger production management, or SPM, project covering the Carrizo Field, and we also began to mobilize for the second SPM project covering the Panuco block.", "In Brazil, activity was also flat during the third quarter with growth on land being offset by less offshore drilling as rigs were redirected towards work-over activities. Still, the growth outlook for Q4 is positive with 3 additional deepwater rigs scheduled to start operations, together with higher forecasted stimulation vessel activity.", "Ecuador saw strong sequential growth as we completed the mobilization of the Shushufindi SPM project. The project is now fully operational and activity and results are progressing in line with our plans.", "During the quarter, we experienced operational delays in Argentina and Colombia, due to a range of local factors, but we are expecting to see solid sequential growth in these countries in the fourth quarter.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew by 7% sequentially while margins were up 126 basis points. During the quarter, Saudi Arabia again posted strong sequential performance, driven by work-over, development and exploration activity. These results were further supported by solar activity growth in Oman, the United Arab Emirates, as well as Kuwait.", "In Iraq, we completed our resource mobilization following the second quarter contract wins, effectively doubling our drilling activity in the country during the quarter. With this market share gain and our well-established execution track record, we have, over the past 2 years, established our traditional international market position also in Iraq.", "In China, we continue to see strong sequential growth on land, driven by higher drilling and stimulation activity as our Chinese customers embark on more complex conventional and unconventional projects. Still, the GeoMarket with the fastest sequential growth in the third quarter was Australia, where offshore activity increased and where our strong contracts position in the Queensland unconventionals is starting to have an impact.", "Following a very strong second quarter, revenue in Europe/CIS and Africa grew by 2% sequentially while margins were up by a further 138 basis points. In the North Sea, we saw strong activity at WesternGeco, which was offset by startup delays on several smaller projects for other product lines, as well as extended summer maintenance shutdowns in both Norway and Denmark.", "In North Africa, delays negatively impacted results in Algeria while issues related to the security situations slowed the activity ramp-up in Libya. Activity in Sub-Sahara Africa remained strong during the third quarter with significant sequential growth in East Africa.", "Russia and Central Asia also saw strong sequential performance, driven by activity growth in Western Siberia while offshore activity remains flat for the quarter.", "In North America, sequential revenue was down 2%, and margins were down 209 basis points. In terms of activity, the results were negatively impacted by a slower-than-expected seasonal pickup in Canada, a 3% sequential drop in the U.S. land rig count, as well as the activity shutdown in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico linked to Hurricane Isaac.", "The negative pricing impact on our hydraulic fracturing business in U.S. land continued in the third quarter as the new pricing levels further penetrated our contract base. Furthermore, in U.S. land, we also saw the first signs of pricing weakness in our coiled-tubing business towards the back end of the quarter.", "In the Gulf of Mexico, excluding the Hurricane Isaac impact, deepwater activity grew in line with our earlier outlook and the number of deepwater drilling rigs is set to reach pre-Macondo levels by the end of the year. We continue to show strong operational performance, and our Gulf of Mexico business is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American markets. In WesternGeco, we operated one dual coil fleet in the central Gulf while multiclient sales were flat with the previous quarter.", "Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group, we opened the Schlumberger China Petroleum Institute in Beijing. The institute houses more than 100 of our petro-technical experts, which, together with domain experts for most Schlumberger product lines, offer a full range of reservoir services to the various players in the Chinese oil and gas industry.", "To further strengthen our position in the emerging shale market in China, we also signed a joint venture with the Chongqing Institute of Geology & Mineral Resources to provide basin studies, subservice data integration and optimize well and completion planning for the new players coming into the Chinese shale market.", "Elsewhere, we continue to expand our presence and capacity for core and fluid analysis with the opening of our latest lab in Houston, which joins our network of over 25 labs around the world. We are also continuing with our strategy of combining our downhole fluid and core-sampling technologies with our lab capabilities to provide a seamless, integrated service.", "In the Drilling Group, we continue to execute our strategy, focused on creating the next step-change in drilling performance through total system integration, and we are progressing well with this work as can be seen by the improvement in the Drilling Group financial results over the past 2 years.", "During the quarter, we reached a significant milestone where Smith Bits, for the first time in their history, captured the #1 market share spot according to the latest Spear's survey. This achievement is another testament to what the Smith segments can achieve through their unique technology and as part of Schlumberger, both with respect to the overall drilling workflow and our global infrastructure.", "Another very interesting drilling technology being introduced by Geoservices is the advanced couplings characterization. Here, we performed continuous petrophysical measurements of the couplings as they come off the shakers. And through novel data processing, we can establish the reservoir quality of the rock and also tie it back to the specific well depth. This will offer a very effective way of optimizing well placement and completion intervals, for instance, in horizontal shale wells.", "In the Production Group, we performed close to 2,100 stages with HiWAY way during the quarter, which represents record activity and a sequential growth of around 60%. In addition to the established HiWAY markets in North America, such as the Eagle Ford, we also saw meaningful penetration into several other basins, including the Bakken and in Canada. HiWAY's production results and completion cost savings have been the main driver for its penetration into these basins.", "We also completed a study of public production data covering the Eagle Ford that show that average production from the HiWAY wells was 65% higher than non-HiWAY completed wells. In the international markets, HiWAY saw continued growth with a near doubling in stage count versus the prior quarter.", "Let's then turn to the macro environment, where both the U.S. and European Central banks announced interventions to support growth in their respective economies. China continued to show signs of slowing growth, but so far, the slowdown appears to be actively managed and, for the time being, kept under control. Altogether, these developments have left the GDP growth outlook for 2012 and 2013 more or less unchanged from the previous quarter.", "At the same time, the supply and demand balance of the oil market remains tight with continued production challenges in the non-OPEC countries and with OPEC spare capacities staying close to a 5-year low. Based on this environment, we continue to see Brent crude prices reported around current levels, although there could still be periods of volatility.", "In the international market, we have seen no material change to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during the quarter, and we still expect our activity to grow in excess of 10% this year.", "In North America, the activity sentiments are currently more negative, both in Canada and U.S. land, with liquids activity no longer able to offset the drops in dry gas drilling. This, coupled with ongoing pricing pressure in hydraulic fracturing, as well as early signs of pricing weakness in coil tubing in U.S. land, indicates no immediate change to the North American headwinds.", "As we continue to navigate the overall macro uncertainty, manage the North American headwinds and capitalize on the steady international growth, we maintain relentless focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution. This execution capability, together with our balanced technology portfolio and unmatched international strength, will allow us to deliver double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2012, as well as solid margin progress, in what remains quite a changing business environment. This position and these capabilities also put us in the driver seat for continued outperformance in 2013, which remains the collective ambition of the entire Schlumberger team.", "Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Paal. We'll now open up the call for questions. Julie?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] With that, we'll go to line of David Anderson with JPMorgan.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Paal, question, international performance, particularly out of Eastern Hemisphere, is very impressive this quarter, particularly how it has progressed over the last year or so. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the drivers behind that. How much of this would you attribute to, say, execution, activity levels, pricing? And I guess what I'm really trying to understand is how much of this momentum do you see continue into 2013, in other words, is it sustainable now and we continue to build from here.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So if I started with the Q3 performance, I would just say that I'm overall pleased with the progress. We are keeping very strong focus on execution as we have been talking about in earlier quarters, and we also are doing quite well when it comes to cost and resource management. We also continue to work on our internal improvement programs, which, by the way, is included in our normal operating cost. So in terms of margins, we saw further progression in Q3, and we had very good incrementals. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our international margins is now at a 3-year high. Some of the drivers behind this is slow but steady pricing increase, driven by new technology sales, as well as strong operational performance. But I would also say that the quality of service is still a market share driver for us, right? The D&M Q3 replacement ratio was again 34:3. So we're maintaining this 10:1 ratio, and this is actually starting to become meaningful for D&M now, which have shown significant improvement in financial performance during this year. So if you then take that performance and try to look forward, we maintain our positive view on international markets and also our performance there, right? We have a very strong international contract portfolio, and this portfolio has solid upside when it comes to both technology and the performance. And the other thing I would like to highlight as well is that we continue to expand the international presence of our smaller product lines. If you look at operations internationally today, we operate in over 80 countries and we have 17 product lines. But in 50% of these countries, we only have 50% of our product lines present. So I would say that we still have a lot of runway in terms of growth and as per market penetration. So in terms of margins going forward, I would just say that we will continue to leverage the size and the infrastructure and the execution capabilities to drive both the top line and further margin expansion. So as overall -- I mean, our view on the international market remains positive, and I'm pleased with the progress in terms of how we're executing. And I would expect us to continue to improve going forward.", "John David Anderson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "More specific questions, just Saudi, if you don't mind. How do you see Saudi market develop in the next several years, and how much of their growth is going to come from gas? I mean, I know we're not going to see the huge massive ramp-up we saw last cycle, but we're hearing more and more talk about gas being one of their focuses up there. So I'm just kind of curious, how much of gas do you see that big -- as a contributor there? And can you give us a sense as to how much that gas market in Saudi has grown over the last year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don't have the breakdown of the rig increases that we've seen over the past year, right? But Saudi today is on track to reach 134 rigs by year end, which they, more or less, indicated. In terms of the outlook beyond year end, we don't expect this -- a dramatic increase in rig count, I would say, in the first half of next year. But rigless activity remains strong and is also a key growth driver for us in Saudi. But like you said, gas is important. Saudi Aramco recently announced a gas discovery in the Red Sea, which -- there's no firm plans beyond this. But with the gas discovery, I think it's reasonable to assume that there'll be more exploration activity around that. And there's also a lot of gas-related activity in the Northwest, linked to both tight gas and shale. So you're right to point out that gas is important, and I would say that gas, in terms of future growth in Saudi, is probably going to be one of the key drivers.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Paal, I was just wondering if you might be able to provide us some perspective on -- you guys put out some very strong performance here relative to your peer group over the last couple of quarters. Maybe provide some perspective on how you plan on maintaining that performance differential going forward. And then in addition, some of your -- some commentary we've recently heard for some land drillers and from some of your competitors are calling for an uptick in activity in the U.S. market, U.S. land drilling market, going out into 2013. If you could give us some perspective on the outlook there, that'd be helpful, appreciate it.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So the first part to your question was related to North America as well?", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just globally, really. It looks like your performance overall for revenue growth, margin performance, et cetera, has been exceeding your peers over the last couple of quarters.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So if I -- if you go back to the first question, I answered that. I think a lot of the elements of our international performance I covered there. So maybe I just focus in a little bit more on North America.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So if you look at Q3, overall, again, solid performance for us in Q3. I'm pleased with the progress. Since we restructured our business about 2 years ago, we now have a very lean and focused North American organization. We have invested quite strongly in infrastructure over the past couple of years. So we are now able to leverage that. And we also -- after the Smith merger, we now have a very broad technology and workflow offering in the North America land marketplace, which we are also able to leverage. And finally, what I would say on the means we have to succeed, we probably have one of the best supply chain organizations in the North American market as well. They have done a really great job in particular, together with our pressure pumping organization, this year. So -- further on performance in North America, if you look at how we have been addressing the fracturing market, more or less from the beginning of this year, we have kept focus on what we call minimum effective margins. This is basically the product of our bid price times the utilization. So if these effective margins go below a certain level, we are prepared to lay down crews. So we laid down crews in Q2. We also laid down crews in Q3, and this is how we are able to protect better, I would say, the margins in our pressure pumping business. Now in terms of the other product lines on land, we continue to have solid performance both from Drilling and Wireline. Obviously, the Gulf of Mexico remained strong for us and was, in Q3, highly accretive again, even with the Hurricane Isaac impact, and this is with flat seismic sales quarter-on-quarter. Now if you look at the North America market going forward, from our standpoint, the -- on the plus side, we expect to see continued strong performance in the Gulf of Mexico from us, both when it comes to drilling activities as well as seismic. And we also see Canada having a positive impact for us in Q4 and Q1, although not to the same level it had in the previous year. Now on the negative side, fracturing margins are going to come down further in Q4 and likely also in Q1 as the new pricing levels work its way through our contract volume. But -- and also -- as I also mentioned, we also see some margin pressure in coiled tubing. Now what's going to happen beyond Q4 or Q1, I would say there's really 3 main questions in my mind. Firstly, will there be a Q1 recovery in liquids rig count after Q4? This is key to maintain the current land pricing overall, both for frac-ing as well as for the other product lines. The second question is will there be a share place in the frac markets and a new pricing floor, given the fact that there are significant excess capacity in the market, and also, when the guar leaf comes, is this going to be another source of market share place. And then the third question in my mind is in terms of how North America, overall, is going to perform, what are really the normalized frac margins. The way I see it or we see it, the frac market in North America today is largely a commodity market with a very low barrier to entry, where capacity is really driving the pricing. And we peaked at around 30% margins, and the trough is now in low single digits. And I would say, in my mind, that the normalized margins are more in the middle of this. They're certainly not towards the upside. So I think these 3 elements, obviously, are going to be important to sort of guide us in how the North America market is going to continue to evolve. But I would say I'm very optimistic, though, in terms of our ability to outperform on a relative basis in North America.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of James West with Barclays.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Paal, as we think about 2013, I want to dig in a little more on Dave's earlier question. Given the large number of startups and staging for contracts, it's underway now, which I guess, first off, makes your margins look even more impressive, but there's a lot of work that's been awarded to yourself and the industry that's getting underway now. That should lead to significant growth in '13. I'm talking more on the international side, of course. Do you see international growth in '13 consistent with '12, or could it be above or below?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think in terms of the activity, like our outlook for international, it's still a little bit early to kind of pin it down in detail, right? We are just entering our planning process, and our customers are doing the same thing here. So I would just say that we maintain a positive view in international markets. We see growth in 2013, and I think the rate of growth, I think, is going to be much clearer by year end. But again, we have not seen any major shift in customer sentiments over the past quarter. So unless there's a dramatic change in their view of the market and their spend at the commodity planning cycle, we are optimistic that it's going to be more of the same for next year.", "James C. West - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then on seismic, which has been an area of strength this year. It seems like the fourth quarter is mostly -- or close to sold out at this point on the marine side, and that would set up for a good 2013. Are you continuing to see good pricing gains on the Seismic side? And am I correct that the fourth quarter is mostly sold out, that that should lead to a very strong '13?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I think that's correct. Q4 is more or less booked, as you say, largely driven by South Atlantic activity, both West Africa and, for us, Uruguay. So our view hasn't changed. We were indicating that we didn't think that Q4 would see the normal seasonal low, and that's actually transpiring. So going forward, we continue to test pricing for 2013 work. We already awarded some work for the next North Sea season, and the pricing is even up from what we have bid earlier, right? We are now pushing about 15% versus the 10% that we talked about earlier. So overall, we maintain quite positive view on the seismic market.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of Scott Gruber with Sanford Bernstein.", "Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Simon, a question for you on initial CapEx thoughts for '13. Baker's come out and guided for a big 25% reduction. Halliburton was out earlier, guiding for a decline as well. Are you anticipating a reduction in spending levels next year?", "Simon Ayat", "Paal just mentioned that we're going to -- we're going through the planning cycle. And I'm going to turn it over to Paal to tell you what the initial numbers that are coming, but we are going through a planning cycle as we speak. And there is a bit of shift between activity places that might require additional CapEx. But Paal have a little bit input now at the early stage?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So firstly, 2012 CapEx spend is going to be around $4.5 billion, as we said, which is in line with the plan that we previously communicated. The main shift we've seen during this year, going back to what we were planning at the beginning of the year, is that we have significantly reduced NAM CapEx, and this has been offset by higher international CapEx. So as Simon was saying, the 2013 CapEx spend outlook, it's still early days. We are just starting in the planning cycle now. But I would say as a general view, at this stage, I would say CapEx would be likely flat to slightly down. The main drivers or the main focus for us in 2013 is going to be the international market, and it's going to be a traditional high-capital service segments, like WesternGeco, Wireline, Drilling & Measurements and Well Testing. Now while we continue to inject capital into these businesses, we also continued to drive efficiency and utilization for all of them to make sure that we can be as lean as possible with how we spend our cash, right? The other key thing for us next year in terms of CapEx is that we are -- we're also continuing to invest further in infrastructure, in particular in Sub-Sahara Africa and also in the Far East, in particular in China. And the last part as well, as I mentioned, we're looking to further expand our smaller product lines into the international market, and there is some associated CapEx with that. But overall, I would say, at this stage, CapEx is likely to be flat or slightly down.", "Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "And if I stood back and think about the broader environment, thinking not just about '13 but into '14, are we entering a period of declining capital intensity now that the big spend on U.S. pumping is over? I've realized there's still roofline investment going on abroad, but sounds like that's going to be flattish, maybe down, relative to this year. And it looks like, too, that the big spend on international shale operation is still a few years off. So if you look at CapEx relative to sales or cash flow, do you anticipate, potentially, a few years of declining capital intensity?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I wouldn't stretch it further than 2013 in the comments that I made. But I think your commentary around investment into pressure pumping capacity, I think those are fair. We have enough pressure pumping capacity at this stage to go around for a while, right, and, I think, so does the overall market. And you're also right in saying that the volume of international unconventional activity is not likely to sky rocket very -- anytime soon. With that said though, the investment into our high-end service line, such as WesternGeco, Wireline and Drilling & Measurements, in particular, for deepwater and exploration type of activities, there's lot of CapEx that goes with these activities. And the returns, both in the capital and the return on sales, is obviously very good to that. So if the market is there, we will happily invest into those businesses and as long as we get the right returns.", "Scott Gruber - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "But the investment in Seismic is primarily technology, not vessel spend right now, correct?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we have 2 vessels under construction, which will be delivered in 2014, where a significant part of the CapEx associated with those vessels will be taken in 2013. Also, as we continue to ramp up the coverage of IsoMetrix on our seismic vessels, that will also be a significant CapEx spend, right? So the Seismic over the next couple of years will be a significant CapEx spend for us, provided the market continues to head in the direction we see now.", "Operator", "The next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Back to the international outlook for a second and recognizing the fact that, as you mentioned, the outlook for '13 should begin to crystallize much better towards year end, but it doesn't -- it's not all that obvious to me that the IOCs, even with very generous oil prices, are generating significantly abundant cash flows, surplus cash flows, which leads to the same rate of growth that we saw this past year. I'm curious as to how -- just conceptually, how growth rates in '13 could match 2012 if the cash flow generation is going to be less generous. And then -- I mean, is the swing factor the NOCs, the greater sense of urgency on the part of Petrobras, more catharsis in West Africa, greater uplift in Saudi? How do we match those growth rates year-over-year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Sorry. First of all, I'm not saying we would match the growth rates. I'm just saying that we maintain a positive outlook on the international market, and we see growth in 2013 as well, right? So it is still -- typically, we don't even talk a lot about the coming year and the -- after Q3, we typically leave that to January. But like I said, we are -- we maintain a positive view on next year. I think it's probably better to look at -- so maybe you can switch from activity and revenue to earnings, right? And I would just say that we obviously continue our focus on growing total earnings, and that's through both the top line and margins. And I would say that assuming no major negative change in the global economy and no further setbacks and a second lag down in North America, we are, at this stage, aiming for double-digit EPS growth in '13, right? And that would be a combination of top line growth, as well as margin improvement. So I think it's too early to kind of break it down to look at what the IOCs and the independence and the NOCs are going to spend next year, because we really don't have the data. But we are aiming for double-digit EPS growth in 2013.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International, Research Division", "Okay, that's fair. And then secondly, with regard to sort of coming back to the near term here. You mentioned you're not going to witness the same seasonality with regard to the contract business, thanks to good bookings in the South Atlantic margin. Do you have a window into the outlook for year-end multiclient sales at this stage in the Gulf of Mexico?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, not really, other than that there is a lease round in November in the western Gulf and there is another one, what, in March in the Central Gulf. Typically, the way the fourth quarter goes when it comes to multiclient sales, it's down to the last week of December when we finalized the last major sales, right? So it's difficult to say what it's going to end up on. But I would just say that in North America or in Gulf of Mexico, there is a lot of positive sentiments around the outlook for the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling rigs continue to rise. We will be at pre-Macondo levels by the end of the year. The lease rounds that are announced, I think, is a positive. So we maintain a positive view on the business there, overall. So I would expect there would be a good multiclient sales in Gulf of Mexico in Q4, but it's going to come down to the last week of December.", "Operator", "Next question is from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about Canada longer term here. By our math, it probably is still north of 10% of your North America revenue stream. And I think what we found there's been some conjecture on whether or not this lower rig count has been more transitory here as opposed to something structural changing within the Canadian market. As we look out to next year, I know you mentioned earlier that you're aggressive in rightsizing your North American operations. But as you see Canada going forward here, do you feel like you're profitably rightsized for how you see the longer-term activity there in that market? Or do you think the industry, as a whole, is frankly probably overcommitted to that market at this time?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think we were a bit surprised when we looked at the -- when we saw the recovery in the rig count over the past quarter. We were expecting it to be pretty much in line with last year, right? Now this is a combination of high gas storage levels, as well as weather and structural conditions, right. So like I said before, we're expecting growth again for Q4 and Q1, but the activity levels are going to be well below last year. With that said, I think, overall, Canada they have a lot of resources, both on conventional gas liquids as well as heavy oil. So there will be a lot of activity, I think, in Canada going forward. We have, in my mind, a good setup there, and we will continue to invest into it as the market evolves. Where we probably have more opportunity going forward is in the heavy oil, which I think we are less represented than we are, for instance, in the shales and on the -- in Eastern Canada. But overall, the -- we maintain a positive view on Canada.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. So as you see it going forward, you're rightsized properly for that -- for the activity levels you forecast and actually be looking maybe to put some incremental services in there?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes that's correct.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "My follow-up would be just -- as we think about international just near term, is there anything, Paal, that would alter the view of kind of what we saw in 4Q as we think about the seasonal uptick that you typically get in your business from your own product sales and the like, that fourth quarter revenue growth, internationally, should be pretty strong here as we look to 4Q?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. No, we don't see anything largely different than what we would expect in previous years. So there's typically an uptick in fourth quarter sales, both linked to software and, say, hardware completions sales, as well as multiclient. So there's always some variation and uncertainty what happens with respect to those sales. But overall, we expect that to occur again this year.", "William Sanchez - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Because as I look at fourth quarter '11, you were up high single digits in Eastern Hemisphere, third to fourth quarter, that's probably not unreasonable to think about for 4Q this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I haven't looked at the numbers. But I would say that a similar type of uptick as we saw last year is not unreasonable to expect.", "Operator", "We'll go to line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Paal, I wanted to follow up on some comments that you made back at the last Analyst Meeting in Boston with respect to the supply chain and procurement initiatives. Can you give us a progress update as to how far along you are vis-a-vis those targets and perhaps some indication of the impact that that's had on the P&L thus far? I know it's a big part of the execution program, but focusing more on the cost side of the equation as opposed to execution on the field.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So I think if you split it into quality and efficiency, I would say the quality part, we have worked on now since 2008, 2009, and it's starting to have a meaningful impact in terms of the overall reliability of our services, right? And that's -- you see that, in particular, in a segment like Drilling & Measurements. So that is part of why I believe we are superior when it comes to execution strength from a quality standpoint. Now the other parts that I referred to over the last quarter was more linked to the efficiency side, and this has much more to do with the internal things like asset utilization, transportation, shared services and this type of things. I would say we are much -- in a much earlier stage of capitalizing all those benefits. You always get some lower hanging fruit as you start focusing in on things. But these programs are multiyear, and we will see gradually fruits of them coming forth in the coming years.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Can you remind us of what the targets are for that program.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I -- we have targets but I haven't shared the targets, and I don't intend to share them.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. The other question I had was with respect to the shale workflow. As we're moving from a horsepower-driven market, everybody's trying to differentiate themselves, and one of the common terms that we've heard just in the last few months has been around the notion of workflow. Can you address the competitive advantages you -- that you think that Schlumberger has in -- with respect to workflow?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. We've been talking about workflow now for a couple of years. So, I find it interesting to see that the broader industry is now taking up the concept and also want to take part in it, right? So the advantages we have is starting off with Reservoir Characterization and our ability to basically establish 3-dimensional models that can predict variation in shale quality, similar to what we can do in conventional reservoirs. Now when you have that capability, you can, firstly, place your wells in the right position aerially. And secondly, when you evaluate the quality of the rock in the horizontal section, you can also complete the parts of the horizontal section which is most likely to actual flow. Today, there's a significant part of the horizontal section that are frac-ed that never actually flows anything, which means that the frac itself was probably a waste. And then the last part also has to do with how you frac these wells. Today, we create a very deep fracture network, and we only are able to prop a small part of it, which means that all the horsepower and the water that you use to create a deeper fracture is also a waste, right? So I would say that we have a very clear view on where the waste in the current process is, and we have technologies and workflows that can help our customers address these. We see a further uptake of these technologies and these workflows in North America. And for the projects that we are involved in internationally, which are more exploration or appraisal focused, we always use these workflows overseas.", "Michael K. LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division", "If you had to sort of gauge growth internationally versus, say, penetration of the workflow domestically, which would grow faster do you think?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I -- it's difficult to say. I would say, in the international market, the two markets that I would say would have the most meaningful activity growth in the coming couple of years would be Argentina and China. And it's interesting to see now that YPF seems to be quite eager to pursue the Vaca Muerta shale in Argentina. So there's a fair bit of rig activity moving into the Vaca Muerta. And I think in that sense, we are a lot more optimistic on the activity outlook for Argentina, at this stage, than maybe what we were one quarter ago. And you also seen some of the moves we have been making in China recently, and that's again at the back end of our view that China also will see a good growth in both tight gas and shale gas going forward, right? So to what extent that is going to generate growth versus the penetration in North America? I think it's a bit of a toss-up. But I would say more and more customers in North America are interested in the shale workflow and the associated technologies that we have to go with it.", "Operator", "Next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Paal, you recently made some very positive comments regarding the clearly attractive subsea markets, and certainly, I understand you maybe in the early stages of looking at opportunities. But 2 questions. Would potentially a JV or an alliance with the subsea production company make sense around the now wholly owned Framo business? And two, given that you do now own Framo outright, would you consider bidding directly on subsea separation opportunities in the offshore market?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. When it comes to, generally, how we -- what we will do in the subsea market going forward, that's something that we're still evaluating, right? So I wouldn't provide any specific comments on any plans that we may or may not have in terms of how we address the market going forward. What I wanted to do when I put subsea on the agenda earlier this quarter was just to indicate our view on what the opportunity in subsea is. And a lot of the opportunity evolves around the fact that the recovery rates are, on average, half for subsea developments compared to what conventional topside developments are. And if you look at the capabilities we are -- we have in terms of subsurface understanding, modeling and prediction, the ESPs, the intelligent well completions and Framo, as you rightly point out, we have a lot of the ingredients that can help drive recovery from these type of developments, right? So would we bid directly or independently on processing projects? We would have to look at how big they were and how we potentially could align ourselves with other players that have some of the capabilities and some of the, I would say, technologies that also needs to go into that project, right? But we are undertaking a number of significant projects with Framo already, some of them we highlight in the press releases that we send out every quarter. And I would just say that Framo, as it is today, is one of our fastest-growing product lines, and they are at the cutting edge of technology. So as it is today, we are very pleased with how it\u2019s performing.", "Angeline M. Sedita - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "No, fair enough. Great business. And then as a follow-up or a separate question, thoughts on Mexico and Russia for 2013, both of them appear that they could be a bit stronger with new opportunities, specifically in Mexico, and what type of opportunities do you see next year in both areas.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. As we started with Mexico, I would say that we have quite a positive activity outlook on Mexico, driven by both land and offshore, and offshore both shallow water and deepwater. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico activity for PEMEX continues, and we have a significant presence on that. There is also continued focus on mature fields in Mexico and a potential for more SPM activity. And there's also now more focus, again, on the shales in the north region as well from the PEMEX side. So I would say that the overall view on Mexico is quite positive for us going into 2013. When it comes to Russia, quite similar, also positive. We expect to see, again, continued growth in Western Siberia, where we have a very strong position through our local presence there, and then you'll have continued exploration activity, for instance, in the Baltic and the Bering Sea. And we also see very solid activity for Sakhalin and the Caspian regions. So you're right to point out Mexico and Russia as positives going into 2013.", "Operator", "We'll move on to line of Brad Handler with Jefferies & Company.", "Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Let's see, maybe you can speak a little bit, guys, to SPM. You just touched on it with Mexico, I know. But can you give us a sense as to perhaps the run rate in the third quarter, how that compares to where it was a year ago or a couple of years ago on the top line?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. We don't disclose those details on other than -- we have -- if you look at the number of projects that we have won and are in the process of taking on at this stage, we are, I would say, significantly up in terms of overall activity and also, overall, the number of barrels that we actually manage, right? So a lot of the contract wins that we've had have been in Latin America. The Shushufindi project is the -- probably the biggest project that we've ever taken on, and the ramp-up has now been completed. We're operating 5 rigs in this project, and we are pretty much on track for the work program and the -- for the production profile that we laid out to achieve. The other project is in the Carrizo project in Mexico, where, again, we are just in the process of mobilizing now or are more or less finished and we are starting to mobilize for Panuco. So overall, I can't give you the exact number for revenue or for production. But we split SPM out from IPM about a year ago, and we did that to put a lot more focus onto these production incentive contracts because it is a differentiated growth opportunity for us, given the capabilities we have here. And also, the margins for this type of business is highly accretive to the overall margins of the company, and that's why we are continuing to pursue them. Now the overall sales process for this type of project is quite long. There's a lot of due diligence work needed to go in. And I would say that we are not -- we're not accepting every opportunity. If we're not satisfied with certain elements of how these contracts are set up, we will turn them down. And we have turned down contracts, even recently, that we decided were not good enough for us. So this is all about portfolio management and risk management, and we will take our time in terms of how we grow the business. But there's a lot of opportunities out there, and we will continue to pursue them.", "Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "You anticipated a couple of follow-on questions anyway, but I'll sneak in another one in the same area.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Sure.", "Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "The -- maybe you can give us some sense of the degree to which, as it sits today, with what you won? There is a performance kicker tied to SPM. Or how integral is that to your selling process? Do all of them have performance bonuses, presumably based on production increases and the like?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. All the SPM projects are performance based. If it's only turnkey drilling or normal contracts, we don't classify them under the SPM product line. So this is where we are typically paid on a fee per barrel. So we will invest the value of our products and services. We will agree a decline curve with our customer. And the production that we will generate through our investments on top of that decline curve, we will get a certain fee per barrel for. And that's, overall, how we are paid. And that's why, generally, this will generate cash for our customers, and there are ways -- this is a way for them to unlock maybe aging assets that is not really a priority for them to spend their cash on. And then that's why this is quite a good business model. Now in terms of how this will be a growth avenue for us going forward, it's still a relatively small part of our business. But again we continue to focus on it, and we will continue to grow it in a -- I would say, in a somewhat conservative way.", "Brad Handler - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. Is it -- do you think it's relatively less or more capital intensive than the balance of your business? Simon, have you looked at it specifically that way?", "Simon Ayat", "No. The capital associated with SPM project is not more than our regular business. What is more than our regular business is sometimes you have investments upfront, and this is part of the overall evaluation of the project and how we will -- how much is the cash flow required upfront and the investment. And the investment is not in CapEx, the investment in services that are spent ahead of time in anticipation of the uptick in the production and, therefore, the additional revenue that we'll generate. We are very conservative on how we will account for these projects, and there is a regular evaluation of the potential of the additional revenue and additional production that will basically compensate for the initial investment.", "Operator", "The next question is from Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose.", "James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Paal, I think in your remarks you talked about new Wireline tool introductions in the quarter. And your largest competitor also talked about that this morning, and theirs was focused very much on the deepwater, and then in return, and they mentioned the Gulf of Mexico. Can you talk a little bit about what your new Wireline tools are that you're introducing and what market they're earmarked for?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, the -- if you look at the 2 latest that we have introduced, is the Dielectric Scanner and Litho Scanner, is all part of the scanner family. So the Dielectric Scanner is focused in on formation evaluation in carbonates and heavy oils and mixed salinity. So these are special type of measurements with relatively broad applications, as you see, right? And the Litho Scanner is, again, a formation evaluation measurement linked to shale, which gives you shale composition and also total organic content, right? So what we are trying to do on the formation evaluation side in Wireline, at this stage, is to focus in on these, I would say, complex reservoirs or unconventional reservoirs in terms of formation evaluation, both in terms of fluid determination as well as the composition of the rock. So those are the 2, I would say, latest and 2 main introductions that we've done recently.", "James D. Crandell - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And as a follow-on, if the domestic rig count, domestic meaning U.S. land rig count, were to fall by another 10%, would you consider Wireline or LWD prices to be at risk of going down under that scenario?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I think if the overall North America land rig count was to drop by 10%, I think I would be concerned about the ability to hold pricing on the other services on land, that being Drilling or Wireline, right? Like I said, we're already seeing some early signs of weakness in coiled tubing. Whether that is going to continue or it's more of a Q3-Q4 effect, which will bounce back next year, it's too early to say. But it's really the first product line that we have seen pressuring so far. The other ones are holding. But you're right to point out that if the rig count was to go down, overall, further, then I think there might start to be pressure on the others. We haven't seen anything yet, but that is something that I would probably worry about.", "Operator", "We have time for one final question from the line of Jud Bailey with ISI Group.", "Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask about a couple of markets. Paal, you mentioned in your prepared comments some of the work you're doing in China. And I was wondering if you could give us a little more color just on that market, how we should think about it in terms of growth opportunity and what kind of product lines you're utilizing the most?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So the -- what's happened in the China market recently is that there's a lot of drive, I think, from the government to develop the unconventionals, both the tight gas as well as the shale gas. They're importing LNG at very high prices, and they have a significant unconventional gas resource in the country, which they are very keen to develop. So tight gas remains the main focus of the 3 main Chinese national oil companies. But shale gas, the government has classified not as hydrocarbon but as a mineral. And when it's classified as a mineral, the -- it is basically open for any other company to bid for licenses and actually go ahead and do work. So there's a lot of interest from other type of companies, whether it's utility, coal companies or just private equity companies, to come in and take licenses in shale and to start developing them. Now a very few of these have any capabilities when it comes to reservoir evaluation or actual well-side execution when it comes to these things. They don't have their own service companies, which the 3 main Chinese companies have. So that's the opportunity for us to have significantly more penetration of the shale market in China as it evolves going forward. And this is, again, why we have made some of these moves in terms of joint ventures. So the joint venture with Chongqing is linked at the reservoir evaluation standpoint, while the joint venture we signed this quarter with Anton Oil is more focused on IPM activities around well construction and frac-ing of these shale gas wells. So there's a reservoir aspect to it, and there is the full portfolio of drilling and production-related activities that goes with it as well.", "Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's interesting. And would you say the better opportunity is it market penetration? Or just the growth of the overall market itself?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think it's actually both. In the past, we've had limited penetration because the state oil companies have their own service arms. We do some of the high-end activities for them. We help them out with certain things. But there's a lot more opportunity in the shale now for these other players to do a much more significant part of the work, so I think that's where the opportunity lies.", "Judson E. Bailey - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. And my last question is just on Brazil. They've taken -- Petrobras has taken delivery to lot of deepwater rigs the last year or so. They're going to get more active in some of their presalt development, but another initiative of Petrobras is trying to stem some of the production declines at -- in Campos. And I just wondered -- I was curious if you could share your view on that market and the opportunities for growth, and to what extent you may be talking to Petrobras on some of their production issues.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I would say that, just in general, the -- we maintain a positive view on Brazil. There has been delays in terms of rig startups, rig arrivals during this year and also when Petrobras turned some of the -- their deepwater capacity towards production. That obviously impacts our drilling rate and product lines as well, right? But they are putting priority on, like you say, stemming the decline and getting production back up again, so that makes sense. And we will work with them in whatever capacity we need to, to help them out with that. But overall, Brazil is going to show good growth going forward. There are probably going to be some bumps along the way, but we are there. We have a very strong presence. We have a very good relationship with Petrobras, and we'll work with them the way they want us to.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I'd like to thank you for participating in today's call. Julie will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay after 10 a.m. today through midnight, November 19, 2012.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald, Please go ahead.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon and good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2013 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday.", "Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.15. This is an increase of $0.18 sequentially and is $0.14 higher when compared to the same quarter last year.", "During the quarter, we completed the wind down of our operations in Iran and as a result we have now classified this business as a discontinued operations. All prior period amounts have been restated. As previously disclosed, we completed the formation of our OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron prior to the end of the quarter.", "We recognized $1 billion gain in connection with this transaction which equates to $0.77 in terms of EPS. We also recorded $0.26 of charges relating to the impairment of drilling related equity investments. From an operational perspective, we had a very strong quarter. Oilfield services second quarter revenue of $11.2 billion increased 5.8% sequentially, pretax operating income increased 15.9% sequentially while the pretax operating margin improved 178 basis points to 20.4%.", "Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3 billion increased 9.6% and pretax income grew by over 25%. This resulted in margins improving by 380 basis points to 30.1%. This growth was driven by very strong performance in both Wireline and WesternGeco combined with the seasonal rebound in SIS software sales and maintenance. Drilling group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 4.4% and margins improved by 97 basis points to 18.7%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling and Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust international activity. Production group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 4.4% while the pretax income increased 12.6%. This resulted in margin expansion of 116 basis points to 15.9%. Growth was led by Well Services as a strong performance internationally and in US land more than compensation for the impact of the spring break-up in Canada.", "Completions and one intervention were also significant contributors to the growth. Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.3% in the second quarter compared to 23.8% in the previous quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2013 to be in the mid 20s, hwoever, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. Yesterday, our board of directors approved the new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest June 30, 2018.", "Our strong projected cash flow over the next five years allows us to increase the level of share buybacks while also maintaining enough flexibility to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities.", "Let me take this opportunity to remind you how we manage our cash flow. Our first priority is to reinvest into the business to drive growth. We do this through CapEx and the investment we make in R&D and future revenue streams.", "From a dividend perspective, over the past 10 years, we have increased our dividend on average by 13% per year. We will continue to review this on an annual basis with our board. After that, we will continue to be strategic when it comes to M&A, then the balance will be spent on stock buybacks.", "For the first six months of this year, we have generated $3.4 billion of cash flow from operations. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.6 billion as compared to $5.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.", "Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $906 million of CapEx, $600 million payment to Cameron for the OneSubsea transaction and $500 million of stock repurchases.", "During the quarter, we repurchased $6.84 million shares at an average price of $73.7. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion as compared to the $4.7 billion we spent in 2012.", "Now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong as international activity recorded significant progress and North American results benefitted from solid execution in land and increasing deployment of new technology in deepwater areas.", "Sequentially, revenue was up 6%. Margins expanded by 178 basis points, which together yielded a 16% growth in operating income. Compared to the same quarter last year, operating income was up 12%. The results were driven by solid activity levels in all our main markets as well market share gains for a number of our product lines on the back of new technology sales and our strong execution and integration capabilities.", "I am pleased with the overall results and even more so with the consistency in our business performance throughout the company seen, for instance, in the margin levels of our four main operating areas, which are all at or above 20%.", "The focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution is also reflected in our incremental margins, which were north of 50%, sequentially, as well as the cash flow from operations which was $2.3 billion driven by both, improving asset utilization and reduction in the use of working capital.", "The strength in our international business was again evident in the second quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 12% and margin expansion of 173 basis points to reach 22%, making up over 70% of the operating income of the quarter.", "Activity and customer plans confirmed our expectations for the year in all our major growth markets, while revenue per rig continued to steadily increase as a function of new technology sales, increased integration related activity and a favorable business mix.", "Our ability to consistently execute remains critical in the international market and is a driver for both, our market share gains and superior margin performance. While we continue to replace competition on contracts where they are unable to deliver, we are becoming more and more selective in terms of where and when we do so.", "In Latin America, the revenue was flat, sequentially, despite a 2% drop in rig count, while margins increased 107 basis points to 20.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 3%, while margin expanded 153 basis points.", "Our Latin America business showed commendable resiliency this quarter by maintaining laser focus on execution, technology sales and cost control overcoming both, activity headwinds and new contract mobilizations and startups.", "In Mexico with the third big round for production intensive contracts was concluded where we ended up bidding for only one of the six blocks. Drilling activity remained soft in the North and East regions of the country following the budget shifts announced in the first quarter.", "In Venezuela we signed a new agreement with PDVSA and we are now in the process of ramping up our activity in the country while payments are on plan. Elsewhere in Latin America, the Shushufindi SCM project in Ecuador is progressing well with production levels well above the agreed targets. While, in Argentina, we continue to be active in reservoir studies and well side operations relating to Vaca Muerta shale development.", "In Brazil, we continued to mobilize resources during the quarter for the new contract signed with Petrobras although overall activity levels were down sequentially. We have several new IPM projects starting in the second half of the year, however the overall activity level is expected to remain flat to slightly down for the rest of the year. Overall, our outlook for Latin America remains unchanged with 2013 being a transition year in terms of activity for the region and we remain comfortable with our position, our plans as well as the actions we have taken to handle the somewhat challenging business environment.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew 11% sequentially on a 3% rig count increase while margins increased 178 basis points to 24.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 28% while margins were up by 330 basis points. In the Middle East growth was again spearheaded by Saudi Arabia and Iraq but our United Arab Emirates and Oman geo markets also posted strong results. Common to all there markets is that we have gained noticeable share in the past quarters. Our business in Saudi Arabia continues to grow through a diverse portfolio of projects on both land and offshore and driven by both drilling and rigless activity.", "In Iraq, we have on the back on an unmatched execution track record built up a significant business that is now starting to yield excellent results. Activity levels continue to increase both in the North and in the South of the country and with our business footprint and contract portfolio, we have clear leadership in what is shaping up to be a very interesting market for us.", "Asia also contributed strongly to the area results by delivering a record revenue in four geo markets driven by robust market share and new technology sales. China led the Asia growth on a rebound from seasonally low land drilling and simulation activity in the previous quarter and also helped by an upswing in offshore activities. We also posted very strong in Australia, driven by continued growth in unconventional activity on land as well as offshore and deepwater activity in the Northwest and Papa New Guinea.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 10% sequentially and margins increased 275 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins increased 33 basis points. As expected, Russia led the growth in the second quarter as the high volume land as well as the offshore business entered the most active phase of the calendar year.", "EMP investments and activity levels in the country remained very strong in terms of offshore and land activity as well as for exploration and development and Russia will be one of our fastest growing markets in 2013. In the North Sea, WesternGeco saw strong activity as the seismic acquisition season started while the offshore drilling rig count stayed more or less flat.", "In North Africa, rig activity in Nigeria started to rebound following the security incident in the first quarter while rig activity in Libya remained flat due to delays and ongoing security challenges.", "In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity in the Gulf of Guinea as well as in East Africa was robust. On the other hand, activity in Angola was subdued in the second quarter due to project delays. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year remained strong driven by both exploration and development projects.", "In North America, revenue was up 2% sequentially while margins increased 65 basis points to reach 19.7%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues were flat while margins were down 83 basis. In the North America land market, the rig count dropped 14% sequentially driven by the Canada breakup and also impacted by the June flooding in Alberta. While the downwards pricing trend in U.S. land continued in the areas of drilling, simulation and wireline, although this slowed in pace during the quarter. However, continued strong drilling efficiency, resulting in solid growth in horizontal wells and frac stages completed partly offset these headwinds.", "Looking at our land performance we continue to execute very well in our product lines and we also see a gradual improvement in the uptake of our new shale technologies throughout the characterization, drilling and production groups. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater rig count is now 17% above pre-Macondo levels and on a year-over-year basis activity has increased by 30%. The call for reliable and efficient service delivery in addition to risk mitigation technologies continues in this growing market and is yielding very strong result for a number of a higher margin and higher market share product lines. In addition to the Dual Coil fleet operating in the Gulf of Mexico, WesternGeco also started isometrics operation in Eastern Canada during the quarter.", "Turning next to technology. During the quarter, we closed the OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron and the JC is now operational. Cameron, with its long history of innovation and firsts in the subsea market is an industry leader in design capability, manufacturing excellence and successful installations. In addition to this, Schlumberger brings a deep understanding of the reservoir as well as industry-leading well completions, subsea processing and integration capabilities. Through the combination of these strengths, OneSubsea will offer best-in-class subsea solutions optimizing the complete subsea production system and helping our customers improve production and recovery from their subsea development.", "In other areas, we saw growing customer interest in a number of our new or recently commercialized technologies. In Wireline, the Saturn 3D fluid sampling probe is enjoying one of the most rapidly growing deployments of new formation of our technology for a number of years. Its ability to acquire reliable pressures and high quality samples in difficult reservoirs has been impressive.", "Reservoir Characterization, the SIS Studio Manager software, which went from concept to market release in only eight months is enabling and increasing number of customer geoscientists to access data, collaborate with peers and share best practices within [partout] workflows.", "Within the Drilling Group, new and innovative drillbit technologies recorded significant progress. Drillbits equipped with Stinger conical diamond elements that add stability and improved drilling speed have now made more than 650 runs in North America alone since their introduction in the first quarter and have achieved an average improvement of 15% in rates of penetration.", "In the second quarter, we commercialized the ONYX 360 rotating cutters that we believe will lead to dramatic improvements in different lengths in abrasive formations. Lastly, at the Production Group, joint deployment of LIVE slickline with ACTive coiled-tubing services demonstrated clear benefits in the efficiency and effectiveness of our well intervention services both, on land and offshore, and units were active in the quarter in both, Latin America and the Middle East.", "Let's now turn to the macro environment, where the business outlook for 2013 has remained largely unchanged since April as expansion in the global economy remained soft. In summary, the U.S. has shown little or no impact of the financial sequester. The Eurozone is still in a two-year recession although the risk of any concrete to leave the monitor union appears reduced. And, recent Chinese data have been mixed with the outlook for long and progressive soft landing remaining unchanged.", "The oil market picture is also largely unchanged. The market is more comfortably supplied than it was in 2012, but spare capacity remains below pre- Libya conflict levels. The year-on-year increase in North American supply is enough to face both, increasing global demand and the production declined in other non-OPEC producing countries. The call on OPEC remains unchanged and is in line with the group's production target of 30 million barrels per day. Overall, the market continues to support Brent prices over $100 per barrel.", "For natural gas, the apparent rebalancing of the U.S. market is still fragile as gas production remained steady and as the power sector has already switched back to coal in some regions on higher gas prices.", "Internationally, Asian LME prices eased on weaker Chinese demand trends, but remained close to oil parity. While in Europe regional supply declined from the North Sea and very cold weather supported highest spot prices.", "Despite the overall slow progress in the economic environment, the latest releases of the third-party E&P spending surveys, so offer durations of upstream CapEx estimates making 2013 the fourth consecutive year of double-digit worldwide gains driven by the international and offshore investments notably in the Middle East and Asia regions, while the North American spending remained flat to slightly up.", "These estimates are further confirmed by the recon outlook that shows double-digit growth in a number of both shallow water and deepwater rigs active worldwide and a 6% growth in the international land rig count in 2013.", "In this market, we continue to focus on [key] control, which is the quality, efficiency and integration aspects of our operational execution. Through this focus, which permeates our entire organization, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver tangible results today as can be seen by our revenue market share gains, unmatched operating margins, strong cash flow and consistent double-digit growth in earnings per share.", "We also remain confident in the outlook of the industry, in our strategic position within the markets we operate in an in our ability to further improve all aspects of our performance going forward, which remains the overarching objective of the entire Schlumberger team.", "That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Paal. Greg, we will now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Good afternoon where you are. A question, Paal, for you on the North American market. You continue to show some differential performance on the margin front despite the fact that and show improvement in terms of activity, revenue and margins despite an anemic rate progression and a lot of discussion here about the well count and so on. So I was just wondering if you can us a little bit of additional color as to what product lines that you see will be benefitting from the shift in the type of drilling that\u2019s taking place in the U.S. marketplace and what kind technologies that Schlumberger has that will continue to enable Schlumberger to share differential margin performance going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think if you look at what enables to show differentiated margins, I think its several things. Firstly, our ability to execute very well on land, whether that is on drilling or on pressure pumping but also the fact that we have a very well balanced portfolio in between drilling and production related activities on land as well as in between land and offshore. So we honestly have a very strong offshore business both rig related as well as seismic but what we have done in recent years is, starting off in 2001 was to restructure the business on land which in previous years, I would say, had underperformed and through that restructuring, I think, we are performing on par with the best if not better in most of our product lines.", "So if you look at the trends of drilling, in the North America land market now going towards more and more horizontal wells, predominantly focused on liquids, all our drilling segments obviously benefit from that. At the same time, our pressure pumping business through new technology deployments such as HiWAY are also benefiting from this. We also introducing to the market our own multistage completion technology, which has been a gap in our portfolio in recent years which also should enjoy quite significant growth going forward. So I think it\u2019s a good balance between land and offshore, good balance between drilling and production on land and overall a very strong focus on execution.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "And as a follow-up on that, with respect to the overall margin performance of Schlumberger, especially in the international marketplace, are you getting any sense that we are starting to see a shift in the industry that will demonstrate Schlumberger's relative product and services strength, whether its deepwater or otherwise? Do you think whether that kind of an inflection point in the marketplace or we are going to see these strengths of Schlumberger?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at our margin performance in international over the past couple of years, I think we have been highly differentiated continuously, right. So I think we have done well in our contracts strategy, what contracts we are prepared to take on and the ones that we see more as must wins. We have continuously introduced new technology and we are also leveraging very well, I think our overall size and infrastructure. So to your question, whether its an inflection, we don\u2019t see any imminent inflection in big pricing at this stage. We are seeing a continuous uptick in another pricing indicator that we track which is revenue per rig. That is continuing to grow and going upwards. That obviously helps our profitability. What drives that up is new technology sales. It is our integration capabilities where we do more and more services and products on each rig and it is also down to the nature of the work that we take on. Typically take on the more complex and more intense work, because it is more difficult to do. If you perform well in that, that also is quite accretive to margins. So bid pricing, we still don\u2019t see any imminent inflection but we continue to drive revenue per rig upwards through new technology, through integration and there's very solid execution.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "James West - Barclays", "You mentioned in your prepared comments, the third party surveys, which of course you are well aware we do a very large survey. And, what we saw when we reran the numbers here in May and in early June was that international spending was creeping up about 300 basis points to 400 basis points. So, curious if you are seeing the same things from your customers who you are having the same post conversation that we are with.", "Then secondarily, which markets do you agree with what we showed as the biggest growth areas of kind of Middle East, eastern hemisphere in general and which seem like markets that are Schlumberger's backyard essentially. Do you see those as the best growth markets for this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So, to the first part of the question in terms of the spend, yes, if you look at the average of the spend surveys, we look at several. I think for international it was about 9% early in the year, and it was generally all of them revised upwards lately to average about 13%.", "So, we generally agree with that upwards revision. We see continued strong activity levels in the international market and those spend surveys are also I would say confirmed from the rig count outlook and also the rigless outlook in terms of activity that we have the second half of the year. So, yes, we are in agreement that that upward revision seems to be reasonable.", "Then second part of your question was?", "James West - Barclays", "On the specific regions where the spending has increased?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So, we highlighted going into the year five major growth regions, right? So, we said that international would grow north of 10% this year. We would see growth in Latin America, but due to the kind of transitional nature both, in Mexico and Brazil as we indicated earlier in the year, we weren't expecting a lot of growth coming out in Latin America which is being confirmed and we said that the main growth markets would be Sub-Saharan Africa, Russia, Middle East, in particular Saudi and Iraq, China and Australia. Those were the five main drivers. So, basically and ECA and MEA were the main drivers of growth in international market.", "James West - Barclays", "Okay. Then just a follow-up from me, the market share gains that you also highlighted in your prepared remarks, are those happening in those markets that are going the most rapidly?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think, in general that's fair. I would say in particular in MEA, we are gaining quite good market share.", "James West - Barclays", "Okay. Great. Thanks Paal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Paal, just a real quick [rig count] about six month behind schedule. Can you concur with that and does that have an impact on kind of your outlook for next 12 months?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at our view on the [rig count], we are still expecting the total rig count both drilling and workover to reach about 170 rigs by the end of 2013 or early 2014, so the rig count evolution in Q2 was flattish, but it is all about when new rigs arrive and how they are commissioned and so forth, but we are still expecting that we will reach the number that we have indicated earlier roughly by the end of the year or early 2014.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Then I just wanted to make sure you touched on that you can't expect bids from us. I was just curious what was about those contracts that kept away? Was it location, work, was it the contract structure or you guys just holding out for another set of tenders?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, let me just give you a little bit of background on our view on these production incentive contracts. So, we've been very clear about our interest in production incentive contracts, but we also stress the importance of picking the right project with the right terms.", "So, we evaluated all the 60s offered in the third in Mexico and based on the very detailed technical and commercially valuations we did, we only fund one field interesting. Now we've been at this field at the price that will give us the returns that we require and that is really factoring in the additional risks associated with these contract terms. The winner bid at a fee close to zero fee per barrel and basically we are not interested in doing that, so we did not win it.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Okay. One last quick question on some of the buyback you announced today. Could you just kind of give us a sense on your philosophy on the pace of that buyback? You talked about the cash flow you are generating over next couple of years. Should we expect the majority of that to go towards share repurchase? I heard on some type of broke in terms of the deal but it seems like you have an opportunity here to kind of accelerate that over the next, all it, I don\u2019t know, three or four quarters here. Am I right in my assessment?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Well, thanks David. As I mentioned in my remark, that the buyback is basically a balancing number for us when it comes to utilization of the cash flow. You are right in your assumption of the cash flow. That's why we said latest by 2018. So as the cash flow proved to be significantly better than what we have factored in the five year scenario in making the $10 billion program, we will accelerate it. We did this in the past. We look at our excess cash over a period of time, taking into consideration the growth that we are anticipating in terms CapEx and as I said investment in future revenue stream activity, be it multi client or production incentive contracts and any balance will go into the buyback. Yes.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from ISI Group. Please go ahead.", "Judson Bailey - ISI Group", "Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on Mexico, if I could. The first is, that's obviously a big market for you guys. Are you there?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes.", "Judson Bailey - ISI Group", "I am sorry. Obviously a big market for you guys, pretty-diverse. Pemex still has pretty ambitious growth expectations in next few years. It obviously pulled back activity in the North. I wanted to get your thoughts. They have the lot of tenders coming up and tenders in process and it would look like, you could see pretty strong growth in that market next year. In your view, is there any reason for skepticism that Pemex may be wouldn't follow through or is there else going on down there that would give you some caution in terms of the growth opportunities down in Mexico?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I don't see any reason for that. I do not think Pemex has signaled that there is a number of bids coming out for the remaining part of this year and probably into next year. We are going to actively compete for all of that work and we continue to see Mexico as a very interesting market for us.", "Judson Bailey - ISI Group", "Okay, all right. Then next question, just on North America. Obviously, very strong margin results factoring in Canada and everything else going on in that market. With the continued growth in the Gulf of Mexico and let's just say that the U.S. landmark, it kind of continues at this methodical pace with very little pricing traction. How should we think", "about Schlumberger's margins in terms of, we would assume you would get some more market share gains, you would benefit from the very strong Gulf of Mexico and a rebounding Canada? Can you help us think about maybe the near term and the long term margins for the Schlumberger in the North America market?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say that over the past year when there has been significant struggles in the pressure pumping business, I think we have shown commendable margin resilience and again, as I alluded to earlier, it is down to how we execute on land as well as the balance between land and offshore. So in terms of what the margin progression is going to be, the main uncertainty is still what is going to happen in terms of pricing on land. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still saw pricing pressure both in the drilling, stimulation and Wireline product lines in the second quarter but that was slowing somewhat in pace.", "So assuming that the pricing is reasonably behaved and drilling efficiency continues to be the main activity driver going forward, I would expect us to show continued margin resilience and obviously we are looking to drive up margins in any operating areas. I can't promise you exactly how that\u2019s going to progress but we have a lot of focus on margins in every part of our business and we will continue to look drive it up in North America.", "Judson Bailey - ISI Group", "All right, great. Thank you Paal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Thanks, good morning. Paal, I was wondering if you could sort of reconcile on the one hand for double-digit E&P capital spending growth, not so much for this year but on a structural basis perhaps going forward internationally, and reconcile the tension between on the one hand the increasing need on part of the customer base to reinvest simply to", "keep production flat and on the other hand increasingly challenged cash flows in a range bound oil pricing burn and rising cost environment. What do you think ultimately happens over the next several years assuming range bound oil prices? Does the rate of E&P capital spending growth decelerate or what happens?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think we are still optimistic about the further need to increase overall E&P spending going forward, right? So, we saw the upward revision for the spend survey this year. And at this stage, although it's early to conclude our next year the customers need to go through their planning process, but we are still optimistic about the initial projections for 2014.", "The resilience in the spend as you say is linked to partly the working intensity linked to fighting decline, but also due to the overall size and complexity of the projects that are undertaking in particular in the international market.", "So, I think for the company, for E&P companies that potentially are or will be facing cash flow issues, we expect them to be likely to shift more of the spend within the E&P spend from more infrastructure related projects towards more well CapEx.", "So that obviously will be good for our business, because that's sort of where we make most of our money on, right? So, I think the general shift from infrastructure towards CapEx is where I expect to happen for those E&P companies that are facing cash flow issues.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Okay. Then secondly switching gears. At the reservoir level, I'm curious as to what your views are with regard to the outlook for U.S. oil production growth, I mean, clearly it's been extremely vigorous. We are up about $1 million barrels per day on a leading edge basis that's 15% to 20% year-over-year, yet I think there is a healthy debate here with regard to the prospects going forward, the prospect of the Bakken growth flattening out and filling their production growths vacuum with other basins, perhaps not as easy as some contend. Where do you fall out with regard to the domestic production outlook going forward stronger for longer, or decelerating or too early to make a case either way?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It's a good question. First of all I would say that the overall production increases that we have seen on our North America liquids, they have been very impressive. We always maintained that it's too early to extrapolate the early production trends in terms of how great they see. Also, I think it's too early to conclude on whether the trends we are seeing on the Bakken, is something that is also sustainable, right?", "For the early production trends, I think we need more information to look at the production of these wells over a longer period of time and I think we also we need to look at the initial rates or the inflow performance for the wells that the operators are started to drill outside of the fairway, right? As they step out on the acreage, so I am going to have to go for option three of your multiple choice there.", "I think it's too early to say both, while we can extrapolate the initial overall trend from North America or whether there is any significant impact or the recent trend that we see in the Bakken.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Scott Gruber - Bernstein", "Paal, I found you comment about becoming more selective regarding when and where you chose you peers interesting. Is this a reflection of capacity constraints desires to avoid problematic contracts some of those? Why is the stance shifting?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think obviously if a customer calls upon us and wants us, generally, we will do utmost to serve them. At the same time, we also have to make sure that we prioritize putting our equipment into the customers that have initially selected us, and if we are going to go on replace the competitor on or their contracts, we obviously need a significant pricing increase from the initial rates that our competitors took the work on for, right?", "So, and there's also other strategic considerations as to where do we put our capacity while it's a priority in terms of the customer mix this well, so can't really going into the details of how we select, what to do. I would just say that we will always look to serve our customers as best as we can. But at the same time, we are continuing to look at how we optimize our business mix and how we maximize the return from the resources that we have up in operations.", "Scott Gruber - Bernstein", "Okay. Then an unrelated follow-up. Can you discuss the efforts internally to improve the working capital management? If you look over the last six months you guys have held the line here on receivables and other current assets but I assume that you are not completely satisfied in the working capital at this point. Then if you have year end targets that you could share with us, that would be greatly appreciated?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well maybe I will say a little bit about what I think the investment community call self help initiatives, right. So first of all, in Schlumberger we believe that in order to maintain and extend to our market leading position, we always need to do better tomorrow than what we did today. So, company wide programs addressing execution improvements they are not really sporadic or episodic with us. They are a way of life. So we have, in recent years or in the recent year, put more focus on working capital on cash generation. In the past before we had more focus on more cost and resource management to be trying to balance the focus on both cost and resource management with cash management.", "So we have specific programs running focused on capital efficiency, around receivables and also around inventory management and we build it into our business plans and we also build it into the incentives of the entire management team. So this is really how we try to put focus on it and what we put focus on in Schlumberger will generally do quite well.", "Simon Ayat", "I would like to add a bit to what Paal said. The last couple of years since the acquisition of Smith, you probably noticed that the working capital as percentage of our sales has gone up a bit. This was all planned. As a result of expanding certain segments or product lines of Smith internationally, which are more inventory intensive segments or products line, we had to increase inventory to meet the expansion that we have done internationally. One of the main reasons for acquiring Smith and integrating it with the rest of Schlumberger is also to use the footprint of Schlumberger, which meant that some of those segments that were mainly U.S. focused we took them overseas and therefore an increase in inventory. We have managed to do this now and going forward we will not have to increase it at the same pace that we have done before.", "Scott Gruber - Bernstein", "Great, I appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. First of all, congrats on your decision to return a greater part of cash flow to shareholders. I think there is a very clear difference at the moment in this evaluation of companies who do that and those who don't in this slower growth environment that they are in. First of all what were the biggest technologies that drove your share gains?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "In terms of specific technologies, let me elevate it and maybe focus in on the product lines. So I would still say we have gained more share in wireline and drilling and measurements. Those are the kind of spearheading segment for these efforts, right. So there is number of new technologies that we have introduced in both these product lines over the past year or two and the uptake of them is good. What we also find now, as you know, we have restructured our engineering manufacturing into same organization about five years ago and this is really starting to pay dividends now because the new technology that comes out, it's performing much better than the initial technologies that came out five or ten years ago. There were lot more teething problems, which we are basically now avoiding. So, the new technology, which is commercialized within its first year, is actually now growing significantly faster than what it did may be five or ten years ago. So, I would say, wireline and drilling and measurements are still the ones again that are gaining the most share.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "So it is then fair to say that this is largely driven by offshore?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No I think, it's both on land and offshore.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and a follow-up question would be, what market share changes are you seeing in the offshore market? One of your largest competitors continuously make claims that they are gaining share across all kind of (inaudible) technologies?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I don't know who they are gaining share from, because it isn\u2019t us. So I think, we are in the offshore market we obviously already have a quite a high share, but we reference Gulf of Mexico in some of these discussions and we continue to gain share in the Gulf of Mexico and in several of our high end product lines.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Just finally, how far away do you think from being a new pricing cycle in North America pressure pumping?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say there is still significant overcapacity horsepower in the sitting on the sides today, so I don't see that happening in 2013, at least. I think, we are still going to have overcapacity as we exit this year.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Finally, what are some of technologies that are reducing the pressure pumping in tentatively of shale oil and gas in North America?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "What technologies do that?", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, HiWAY is obviously one of them. We use significantly [less] and also generally less water in the operations that we do with HiWAY. The other way of reducing or lowering the intensity of these operations is to use much more of the subsurface approach prior to actually designing the jobs, right?", "So, having a much better understanding of the subsurface will allow you to design the completion of the well and the amount of horsepower water and pump use by be more selective in which stages you frac and also using more sophisticated frac fluids like HiWAY.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Are you seeing a change in attitude there with the shale oil gain becoming more and more of a large company gain?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Not a dramatic change, but I would say we have. We are starting to get several key customers that we are collaborating much closer with than what we've done in the past and where we engage all the way from characterization to drilling and production and taking a much more sophisticated approach to how we go about working with them on their developments, right?", "So, it's still relatively slow, but through some of the contracts we won over the past 12 months to 18 months, we have established as part of those contracts, a very strong technical collaboration agreements, which are also benefiting technology penetration.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "So, on Forest Oil, the contract being in Eagle Ford, how would you characterize that in the context of just that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I can't really comment on that. Forest will release their results I think in a couple of weeks. We'd need to refer you to them.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "Thanks and good afternoon, guys. I wanted to just follow up on the North American onshore market and a little bit on the Forest Oil as well as Spark. Let me ask the questions just from the context of shift in business model in North America. I think both with Forest as well as Spark, you've tried to introduce a new model to the U.S. land market and I was just wondering now as you've been out marketing concepts like that for a while what the perception has been and what you think the uptake and penetration rate might look like?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "On Spark, we are seeing a reasonable uptake on it. Nothing dramatic which we weren't expecting either. It's mainly focused on customers that are have vertically integrated. They have their own horsepower with very limited capabilities in terms of pumping more sophisticated fluid systems, so we continue to do Spark-related activity, but it isn't a significant part of our business which weren't really expecting either, but it's progressed reasonably well and we are happy with the performance from this. We are mainly doing Spark in North America, but we are also doing Spark in China for some of the frac operations there.", "The other part of your question in terms of the Forest Oil type of deal, initially as we said when we closed the Forest deal, our main motivation for doing that type of a deal was actually to get a display window for our shale technology capabilities, so we haven't really been actively out promoting SPM or production incentive type of contracts in North America, beyond trying to get that deal done, so we could demonstrate our capabilities for the technologies that we have developed. So, we know other progress or we haven't really even been pushing that model beyond that one deal we struck.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Thanks. Good morning. Paal, two questions, one, I wanted to follow up on just how things are progressing on the SPM side. In the first quarter, you mentioned you had 10 projects. Goal was that two to three a year. I didn't see anything in the press release with regards to another announcement there. Perhaps if you could just update us on your thoughts? And maybe perhaps your size for us on a revenue basis annually? What SPM is going to contributing to the top-line for Schlumberger?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, you are correct. We didn't sign any SPM projects in the second quarter. Our goal of adding two to three projects a year basically stands firm. But again, as I mentioned on my comments on the Mexico bid round, we will only sign the project that we believe are right for us. This is all about portfolio management. It is about picking the right projects, the right fields with the right terms and we have very stringent return criterias in terms of what we will engage in. So, our goal is two to three deal. If we can get the right ones, we will do it and if we can't find the right ones we won't do it. In terms of the impact on the business, it's still relatively a small part of our overall revenue stream, but by picking the right project it is a highly accretive part of our revenue stream and we will continue to focus in on maintaining it as highly accretive.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Right. Your view has been that these projects are accretive to margins and essentially every geo market in which you have rolled it out. Is that correct?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "That is correct.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Okay, great. Well, my second question was just a follow up on North America margins, specifically as it relates to Geco which was called out in the press release but you didn't you specify, perhaps I missed it in earlier comments, whether or not Geco really was being driven in the Gulf, more by the Marine side of the business or whether we saw multiclient or maybe a combination of both? Then maybe just address Gulf of Mexico Geco as we think about the balance of '13?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, in the Gulf, in terms of ongoing operations, we have one Dual Coil fleet operating. It continues to operate in the Central Gulf. It has got a good backlog of things to do there on the multiclient site acquisition. We have an ongoing multiclient late sales business where we had some revenue progression which is seasonal basically from Q1 to Q2. We don't break up what that revenue progression was in a multiclient. You can see what the total is. The total for Q2 worldwide was $250 million, up from $175 million in Q1. So a part of that was North America, but I would say as the general comment on the multiclient performance in North America in Q2, it was below our expectations. We were expecting more sales to multiclient than what we actually realized.", "In addition to the multiclient business in terms of late sales and acquisition in the Gulf of Mexico we also started of the third-party survey offshore Eastern Canada and this is with isometrics. So those are basically the WesternGeco business in North America.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "All right. That sounds like that continues in second half of the year should be accretive to overall North America margins?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "They should.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Okay. Thanks, Paal, for the time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita - UBS", "Good morning, guys or good afternoon and it hasn't been said. So I will say, congratulations on a great quarter. Very impressive of you and the team.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you.", "Angie Sedita - UBS", "On Mexico, Paal, I appreciate the color on the production of incentive contracts and the bidding there, but your thoughts on, I believe the next round of awards will be IPM potentially as much I have heard as $8 billion to $10 billion in contracts. You view that as the better and more attractive opportunity in the region and then along with that, have you had conversations with Pemex on the potential timing and is it multi-year for Mexico to open up and the opportunities there?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So what we know about the bids coming out is that there are a series of bids. So probably there would be a single service bids, there would be IPM well construction bids and there will probably be more production incentive type of bids coming out as well over the next couple of quarters. So, as I said earlier, we are very interested in the Mexican market. It is going to be very highly competitive. It has always been highly competitive but it's about, as I said before, being able to bid strategically, trying to pick up the right contracts and the right opportunities and having a plan for how you would create value for Pemex and at the same time create value for Schlumberger as we engage in these contracts, right. So I gave you a quick summary of our view on the third run of the FDM contracts and we will continue to evaluate every opportunity for gaining more work in Mexico and will engage in it with a view to make returns for the Schlumberger shareholders.", "Angie Sedita - UBS", "All right. Then on the U.S. market, thoughts on the pace of activities for Q3 and Q4, are you seeing based on your conversations with the customers still steadily higher in Q3 as far as activity and Q4, the seasonal decline or are we going to run into the spent budgets that we did last year?", "Simon Ayat", "Well, whether Q4 is going to see the same as last year, I think it's just too early to say. Obviously, as WTI ticking up a little bit over the past month or so could be a positive preventing that from happening, but I still think it's too early to say what will happen in Q4.", "Our overview on the second half of the year U.S. land is, I think rig count is going to remain relatively flattish, but drilling efficiency is going to be the main activity driver, again generating reasonable growth in stage count, sequentially.", "Looking at Canada, we expect the H2 rig count at this stage to come in or the recovery in the H2 rig count to come in lower than 2012. While the stage can be expect to be more or less flat with last year. Then, again, continued strong activity in terms of offshore Gulf of Mexico, both shales and deepwater.", "Angie Sedita - UBS", "Then finally you mentioned Russia being one of your strongest geo markets in 2013, is that in part driven by the Eurasia deal, or is it outside of that project?", "Simon Ayat", "Well, the Eurasia deal is part of our business and it's important part of our business in Russia, but it is only part of it. We have significant other activities both, on land and offshore both, in Sakhalin, in the Caspian, in the Barents, in the Arctic, so we are very well diversified in terms of both, customers and regions that we operate in Russia and that's why I think we manage to sustain very high growth rates.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Jim Crandell from Cohen. Please go ahead.", "Jim Crandell - Cohen", "Paal, one of your competitors was indicating in the marine seismic business relative softness in bidding activity for the fall winter season. What are you seeing in the fall winter season relative to the spring summer season and how does pricing look for that season right now?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "For the marine market, we maintain our positive outlook, which we have basically conveyed over the past couple of quarters, right? The way we see its supply and demand appears to be relatively well balanced. In terms of bookings for Q3, we are basically already fully booked, and also Q4 in terms of backlog is filling up quite well. So, activity wise, things are looking quite good for us.", "In terms of pricing, in the second quarter, we didn't see any significant further traction in terms of basic bid pricing, but we also track another pricing indicator, which is revenue per streamer and our revenue per streamer was up about 10%, sequentially, and that's mainly at the backend of new technology and the type of service we conduct and also some seasonality effect. That's basically where we stand.", "Jim Crandell - Cohen", "Good. That's helpful. And, one follow-up question about WesternGeco, when you used to break it out, this would of course be obvious, but could you give some indication where margins are relative to let's say the oil service average at WesternGeco, and I am just trying to handle on how much margin leverage there was there going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We are not breaking out about any individual product line is doing in terms of margins. I can't really comment on that, but given where pricing stands and given the very significant new technology portfolio, we have and just putting into operation both, on land in terms of processing as well as marine, we obviously see margin upside potential for WesternGeco.", "Operator", "And, we have time for one further question today. That question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering", "One of my questions I have is around the U.S. land business. You mentioned improved well service and pressure pumping utilization several times in the release. What are your thoughts around bringing some of the never deployed equipment in to the market given where your margins are? How do you see that as an opportunity in the second half of the year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So we will look at bringing equipment in from what we have apart when we can get the utilization that we require for the overall group and at this stage we are not looking to bring anything back in that we have parked and I don't expect that to happen in 2013.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering", "Great, thank you. Then my last question is just around the reservoir characterization business. With the significant margins increase there, I mean obviously multiclient helps, but if I look back historically there doesn't really tends to be a follow-up in multiclient sales in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter. So any reason we should think about margins perhaps stepping backwards in the Reservoir Characterization business in the second half of the year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, nothing fundamental. This is a huge business and there are mixed effects depending on what region grows and there is exploration and development type of mixes even in characterization, but overall I expect the Characterization Group to continue to post very strong margins.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering", "All right, thank you guys very much.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you. Okay, on behalf of Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Greg will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you.

For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions; instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.", "With that being said, I\u2019ll turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead, sir.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2013 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York City and joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We will welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.29. This is the highest earnings per share for a quarter in the history of Schlumberger. It represents an increase of $0.14 sequentially and it is $0.25 higher when compared to the same quarter last year.", "As a reminder, last quarter we completed the wind down of our operations in Iran and as a result, this business was classified as a discontinued operation. All the prior period amounts have been restated. Third quarter revenue of $11.6 billion increased 3.8% sequentially with 7% growth in North America and 3% International.", "As you will recall from a financial reporting standpoint, we do not consolidate the OneSubsea joint venture. As such, this was the first quarter we did not record any revenue from the subsea business that we transferred to the venture. Excluding this effect, revenue grew by over 5%. Oilfield Services pretax operating income increased 9.6% sequentially, while the pretax operating margins improved 114 basis points to 21.5%.", "Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3.2 billion increased 7.3% and pretax income grew by just over 8%. This resulted in margins improving to 30.4%. This growth was driven by very strong international performances in both Wireline and Testing Services, most notably in Russia. Improved vessel utilization at WesternGeco also contributed to the growth.", "Drilling Group revenue of $4.4 billion increased 2.8% and margin improved by 154 basis points to 20.3%. These increases were largely attributable to the Drilling and Measurements and M-I SWACO on robust offshore activity. Production Group revenue of $4 billion increased 2.5%, while pretax income increased 13.1%. This resulted in margin expansion of 165 basis points to 17.6%. Excluding the effects of the transfer of our subsea business to OneSubsea, Production Group revenue grew by over 6%. This growth was led by Well Services on a strong recovery following the seasonal spring breakup in Canada last quarter. Increased activity for Completion and Artificial Lift as well as continued increasing profitability in SPM, were also significant contributors to the growth.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 22.7% in the third quarter, compared to 23.3% in the previous quarter, reflecting the business mix between North America and International. The year-to-date effective tax rate for 2013 is 23.2%.", "From a cash flow perspective, we have generated approximately $6 billion of cash flow from operation during the first nine months of this year. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities, while at the same time, returning over $2.7 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases during this period.", "Net debt at the end of third quarter was $5.6 billion. This is unchanged from the end of Q2, despite the fact that we spent $833 million on our stock buyback program during Q3. During the quarter, we spent $953 million on CapEx and repurchased 10.1 million shares at an average price of $82.61. Total year for 2013, CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion as compared to the $4.7 billion spent in 2012.", "And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. Our third quarter results continued to show good progress driven by solid performance in both the International and North American markets. Our strong focus on integration, quality and efficiency remains core to our execution, and I am pleased with the response we are seeing from our organization in addition to the impact the efforts are having on our results.", "Sequentially, revenue grew by 4% excluding our subsea business, which in Q3 is included in the OneSubsea JV, while margins expanded by 114 basis points to yield a 10% growth in pretax operating income. Compared to the same quarter last year, pretax operating income was up 20%.", "New technology sales coupled with further market share gains contributed strongly to the quarter\u2019s results, and this is also reflected in our revenue per rig indicator, which improved again sequentially. The size and breadth of our operations and the quality of our execution allowed us to once again show widespread consistency in terms of financial performance, with all four operating areas posting operating margins north of 20%. In addition and for the second quarter in a row, we posted sequential incremental margins over 50%, while free cash flow progressed from the already solid levels of Q2 to reach $1.5 billion driven by improving asset utilization and tight management of working capital.", "Our International business continued to strengthen in the third quarter with year-over-year revenue growth of 12% and margin expansion of 134 basis points to reach 23%. Sequential revenue growth was 3%, dampened by operational delays in some regions, but proactive management and disciplined execution allowed us to generate 73% incremental margins on this growth. In spite of the operational delays experienced in Q3, we have not seen any structural changes to customer plans and we continue to maintain a positive outlook for our International business.", "In terms of pricing, we are not seeing any signs of an inflection point. However, the current operating environment with highly competitive pricing on basic services and slow but steady activity growth where we can get a premium for new technology and for the quality of our execution, suits us very well, as it plays to our strengths and allows us to continue to generate superior financial results.", "In Latin America, revenue was up 1% sequentially, while margins were flat at 20.6%. The sequential results were driven by strong performance throughout the area with the exception of Mexico and Brazil, where continuing challenges tampered growth. While we see the current headwinds reducing somewhat in 2014, we expect the situation for our overall business in the region to remain more or less unchanged in the fourth quarter.", "On a year-over-year basis and in spite of the ongoing challenges, revenues were up 4%, while margins expanded 273 basis points. In Mexico, revenue was down sequentially driven by the completion of contracts in the north and lower product sales offshore, which were only partly offset by the ramp up of activity in the south. In spite of the challenges we had faced in Mexico this year, we remain optimistic on the longer-term outlook for this market, and we are actively positioning ourselves for the future opportunities.", "In Brazil, revenue was also lower sequentially due to the startup of new contracts with Petrobras as well as due to lower activity for both independent and international customers. Based on the latest customer plans, we expect our activity to remain flat in the country in the fourth quarter. Elsewhere in Latin America, our business is progressing well driven by Ecuador, where the Shushufindi project continues to perform better than plan, by Argentina where we are actively involved in the Vaca Muerta shale work and by Venezuela where we are still ramping up activity following the signing of the payment agreement in the second quarter. In the Middle Eastern Asia, results were particularly strong, with sequential revenue growth of 5%, while margins increased 151 basis points to 26%.", "On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 25% while margins were up by 330 basis points. In the Middle East, sequential growth was, again, solid in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, while the highest growth rate was seen in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, where we also have very strong market positions. We are currently in the process of transferring in additional people and equipment to Saudi Arabia to keep pace with the additional work that we are taking on, while the \u2013 while in the United Arab Emirates, we have just completed a large mobilization linked to a recent major contract win.", "Asia also posted strong sequential results headed up by China, where conventional and tight gas activities on land were the main drivers. We also signed our first SPM project in China during the quarter and the team that will manage this tight gas project in the Ordos Basin will be on the ground in Q4. Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia also showed strong growth in the third quarter, driven by offshore exploration and development work, while activity in Australia was flat sequentially.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue was up 2% sequentially and margins increased 189 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins were up 83% basis points. Russia was, again, a major driver for our performance posting a record quarter with strong sequential activity growth as well as excellent incremental margins.", "Our wide footprint in the region provides a solid foundation for our business, which is essential for addressing such a large and diverse market. These sequential results were driven by Russia land and Sakhalin on high exploration and development drilling, and going forward, we continue to see Russia as one of our fastest-growing markets.", "In the North Sea, sequential growth was driven by strong WesternGeco seismic activity and solid drilling activity in Norway, while our UK business was impacted by summer rig maintenance. In North Africa, we had another challenging quarter in terms of top line growth due to operational delays in Algeria and continued security challenges and lower rig activity in Libya.", "In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity was mixed as a result of project delays linked to the influx of new rigs to the region. Still the overall activity outlook remains robust as the surge of rigs into the market continues and as customers firm up exploration programs in frontier countries. In North America, we had a very strong quarter with revenue up 7% sequentially to set an all time high and with margins expanding by 57 basis points to reach 20.3%.", "On a year-over-year basis, revenues were up 9% and margins were up 176 basis points. In the land market, the U.S. rig count remained flat sequentially while the seasonal recovery in Canada was more or less on par with last year. The downwards pricing pressure continued in most product lines in the third quarter including pressure pumping, although at a slowing rate.", "Looking at our land performance, I am very pleased with the quality and efficiency of our execution as well as with the team work within our organization, which is a key driver for our results. We have come a long way since we started the transformation of our North America land business three years ago, to the point that we are now setting the pace in North America land just as we do in the rest of the world in terms of both new technology deployment as well as financial results.", "As an illustration of this, we activated four additional hydraulic fracturing fleets in U.S. land during the third quarter, following a number of recent contract wins. As a result, our third quarter stage count increased by 7% sequentially. Looking at the North America offshore markets, we also posted solid sequential growth driven by new technology sales and the quality of our execution. Offshore Eastern Canada, we successfully completed an isometric survey in early September and activity continued to be strong in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico with minimal impacts from the hurricane season so far this year.", "Let\u2019s then turn to technology, where I will give you an update on our ongoing progress in the shale markets in North America. Over the past 12 months, we have continued to actively promote our shale reservoir workflow to the market with a strong focus on optimizing both well locations as well as completion design. As part of these efforts, we have introduced a data consortium business model, where multiple customers with neighboring acreage can contribute reservoir and production data and then co-fund field and well studies as well as the construction of 3D reservoir models for the shale plays.", "In return, each customer receives all the findings and conclusions from the consortium studies in addition to the reservoir model covering their acreage. We have so far conducted three such studies with very interesting findings and conclusions and these studies together with our technologies and workflows has helped to significantly improve the well performance for the participating customers.", "One major conclusion we have confirmed is that in order to optimize production, recovery and costs of the shale developments, there is a clear need to shift focus from the level of a stage down to the level of the individual perforation clusters that make up a stage. The reason for this is that the studies including production logs show that in traditional completions on average between 30% and 70% of the perforation clusters do not contribute to production.", "This means that we are not effectively addressing the available shale reservoir throughout the entire length of a stage and that we generally over-fracture a subset of the perforation clusters. Based on these findings, we are actively working on a number of technologies that target this opportunity.", "During the third quarter, we started field testing one of these new technologies, a novel solids-based diversion technology. The diversion pill is added to the fracturing fluid at various times during the pumping of a stage and this effectively seals off the clusters that are currently taking frac fluid. This allows us to access the perforation clusters that have yet to be properly fractured.", "This new diversion technology has two primary applications. first, in improving production and recovery by ensuring that more perforation clusters are accessed within a traditional stage; and second, in lowering completion costs by increasing the length of a stage, thereby reducing the number of frac plugs installed and subsequently milled in the well.", "Diversion technologies are not new to the fracturing market. they have been around in the industry for a while in various forms, however, so far without showing tangible or consistent results. The novelty of our approach is in the robust design and engineering of the diversion pill and the fact that field test results so far are showing very promising results.", "We plan to continue our field testing of this technology in the coming quarters, and in addition, we will also evaluate the technology as a potential way to refracture existing wells that are underperforming in terms of production. In parallel with our growing new technology penetration of the North America shale market, we have been gaining market share in hydraulic fracturing in recent quarters at what we consider acceptable incremental margins.", "These market share gains led us to activate the four additional frac fleets I referred to earlier in my comments. In terms of the equipment, the four new fleets were mobilized from pumps made available from our existing fleets that are in operation, due to steadily improving asset utilization and hence represent a zero net capacity addition to our field operations.", "This significant achievement is a result of ongoing R&D work focused on improving the reliability, extending the maintenance intervals, and reducing the maintenance costs of our hydraulic fracturing fleet. The strategy driving these R&D efforts has been to improve the design of the consumable part of our pump, rather than building a new pump that requires additional capital investment. These innovations have already helped to improve reliability and reduce the maintenance costs of our asset base.", "Currently, only a subset of our fleet has been upgraded, but we expect that through our normal maintenance schedule, we will have the entire fleet upgraded by the end of 2014. This upgrade will be fully covered through our ongoing operating costs and involves no capital investments.", "Let\u2019s now turn to the macroenvironment, where we in recent months have seen a number of positive signs in the world economy. The Eurozone is now out of its longest recession on record, the U.S. continues to show favorable trends in spite of the fiscal debate and the most recent data from China suggests a lower risk of a significant slowdown.", "Overall, these factors are offsetting lower growth expectations in some of the emerging economies. These trends are currently expected to continue in 2014, translating into both a higher GDP growth rate and increasing global oil demand compared to 2013.", "On the supply side, spare capacity, including the shut-in production in Libya, remains stable at around 4.5 million barrels per day. And even with an unlikely increase of Iranian crude exports in 2014, spare capacity will likely remain in the range of 5 million barrels per day in the coming year.", "At this stage, we therefore expect continued support for Brent crude prices around $100 per barrel going into 2014. However, the makeup of the risk premium is likely to shift somewhat with lower supply uncertainty and potentially lower geopolitical risk, offset by more resilient demand and lower macroeconomic concerns.", "The international gas market is expected to remain stable, supported by strong demand in Asia, while in the U.S. resilient production levels and strong competition with coal indicates that our recovery in dry gas drilling activity continues to be pushed out in time.", "In terms of E&P spend, the second half of this year is unfolding in line with expectations. Visibility of 2014 is still limited, as our customers are in their planning process. but at this stage, we foresee a continuation of the overall trend seen in 2013, which should yield another year of steady activity growth.", "In this environment, our entire organization continues to focus on both new technology sales and the quality and efficiency of our execution. In parallel with our ongoing operations, we are actively pursuing our internal transformation programs focused on leveraging the size of our operations and the breadth of our offering and with a clear goal of further elevating our performance in terms of top line growth, margin expansion and cash generation.", "That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, Paal. John, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We do ask in your time, if you can please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. First, we go to James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, James.", "James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Paal, clearly good progress in your strong momentum in the international markets, I know you touched on kind of how the year should end up here in case some broad guidance reports. I was hoping you could dig in a little bit further on 2014 and just give us your view of, we had obviously \u2013 we\u2019re going to have strong growth this year, probably low double-digit growth internationally on E&P spending, do you think that\u2019s going to be kind of steady, more the same, is it going to accelerate or is there potential for some slowdown in the E&P spending?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, as I mentioned, James, in my prepared remarks, I think it\u2019s still early to comment on specific numbers on what the international growth is going to be next year, but as I said, the \u2013 from where we stand today, I think a continuation of the trends that we\u2019ve seen this year is our most likely bet. That means reasonable growth in the spend levels, but that the market dynamics that we play in will continue to see steady activity growth, but competitive basic pricing. But as along as we can get a premium for new technology and the quality of our execution, we are comfortable that we can continue to generate solid incremental margins without a inflection in the pricing.", "James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Understood, okay and then just a quick follow-up from me. On the international markets, you mentioned Russia is one that looks to be good for 2014. What other kind of key large markets are you looking at to drive this growth?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would probably name the same five that as I\u2019ve been talking about throughout this year. So that\u2019s basically\u2026", "James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sure.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "\u2026Russia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, with particular focus on both Saudi Arabia and Iraq, but UAE, we have also gained significant share in recent quarters and I see the UAE also to be a strong growth driver in 2014, and then, in addition, China and Australia, as we talked about again this year.", "James Carlyle West \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we go to line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks [indiscernible] Paal. So Paal, just curious your thoughts around the North American market and your ability as you said to utilize your efficiencies to increase the number of frac crews operating. Just wondering what\u2019s your concept in terms of the implication? You already have 20% excess capacity of equipment and if you are getting more efficient in utilizing your existing assets in the marketplace, do you think it takes a while longer for the supply, demand lines to cross with respect to frac?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I can only speak for us, but I would say that we still have upside in terms of the operational efficiency of how we conduct our business, which we show with the activation or basically creation of four additional fleets out of the existing asset base that is currently in operation. So yes, at least for us, I would say that in general it would take us most likely longer to consume the overcapacity we have, unless we gain significant share to the point that we choose to activate some other fleets that we have in the idle asset program as well. But as of now, we are continuing to focus in on the operational efficiencies of the assets we have in operation, and if we can get decent incremental margins on additional work that we potentially take on, we will primarily look to create fleets out of assets currently in operation before we look to the idle asset program.", "Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So from your standpoint, then if I were to \u2013 and if I understand what you\u2019re saying correctly that irrespective of the excess capacity in a marketplace that may exist or may continue to exist, given your internal drivers, you feel very confident about your ability to get margin improvement?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, in the pressure pumping business, not dramatically right, because pricing is actually still going down, but as long as we can offset that with new technology and operational efficiency, there is potential to get some improvement in margins in pressure pumping, but obviously what helps our margin as well is a strong offshore business and also a good drilling and characterization business on land, where the pricing pressures have been less than what we\u2019ve seen in the pressure pumping.", "Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. And then my follow-up question would be in the context of the level of optimism that you expressed in your commentaries here on the call and in the written commentary, how do you feel about the progression from an earning standpoint. I think the Street has tended to get out in front of itself a little bit too much and put you guys in a tough position where you had to hog numbers down, how do you feel about the earnings progression as it sits right now, as you head into 2013 and even more importantly into 2014?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if we started looking at Q4 first, as you know, we do not give guidance, but I would say a couple of things about the fourth quarter. Firstly; that the fundamentals of our business remains intact going into Q4, but there are some seasonal effects that I think everyone should factor in. On the negative side of these effects is that we are likely to or we will see seasonal slowdown in some of our highest growth markets this year such as Russia and China, which will have an impact. We\u2019ll see the normal seasonal slowdown in Marine Seismic and we also expect to see some impact from the holiday season in North America. While on the positive side, we have the year-end product sales, which will offset some of this. But overall, if I look where the current consensus for Q4 is now, I would say it\u2019s about right.", "Now looking into 2014, obviously very early to look at specific EPS targets, other than that; again, the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our overall target is going to be to continue to deliver double-digit growth in earnings per share, and that will be for the fourth year in a row.", "Kurt Hallead \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. Paal, I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. So Paal, you\u2019ve been highlighting the new efficiency and reliability efforts that you\u2019ve been implementing throughout the organization. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about how this has already attributed to margin improvement, specifically, as I kind of look at Europe, Africa, CIS margins. Over last two years, you\u2019ve gone from mid-teens to low 20s now and Middle East margins kind of took a step up. Could you talk a little bit about how much of that was due to these efficiency efforts that you have in place and how much is left in there do you think over the next couple of years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say that the progression we have shown in these operating areas over the past year is partly down to very strong management focus on managing both working capital and costs in general, so that on basic activity growth without pricing, we can generate quite significant incremental margins. So our transformation programs are looking at some structural changes to how we are set up and how we conduct and run our business. I would say that there is not a significant part of these structural changes that have taken place so far. So a lot of what we are doing now is just managing with particular focus on driving both cash flow and incremental margins, and that overtime, we will see more of the impact of these structural changes as part of the transformation. So there is little structural changes impact on our results as of yet.", "David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So, in other words, even without pricing, you should still see margins continue to improve in eastern hemisphere?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, that's what we're going to work towards, yes.", "David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. Okay. On the U.S. side, I was just curious you talked a lot about the technology and particularly on the perforation clusters. I think in the release, you had talked about Whiting. I was just curious if you could kind of compare and contrast the E&Ps versus the majors in the resource plays that you are working in. It seems to us like the E&Ps are a lot closer towards the true development phase whereas the majors are a little bit further behind. I\u2019m just curious in terms of technology that you are talking about. Are we talking more of your conservation of the E&P side or are the majors kind of sitting back watching and then will implement this later? How do you see this playing out?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think generally, we talked to all of our customers about these things. So I don't see a huge difference between what the independents do and what the IOCs do in this market space, right. I mean, it's all about the acreage, the challenges and the main focus and priorities that they have. So we are openly discussing the whole range of capabilities and new ideas and innovations that we have with all our customers and I can't really separate I would say who is doing what. I think they are all eager to look at what can be done better and the way they are implementing obviously varies depending on what their priorities are.", "David Anderson \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And next we go to Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.", "Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Thank you. Good morning. Back to your markings, Paal, for a second and your internal transformation. So I was struck by the fact sort of breadth and sweep of the internal transformation with regard to structural change, which you\u2019re trying to prosecute and this is the second consecutive quarter that you have generated incremental margins in excess of 50% and yet you say thus far that has very little to do with the internal transformation that you are trying prosecute?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "In general, yes. These \u2013 we always are doing pilots, we are trying things out at a small scale in various places around the world, but that\u2019s in its \u2013 still in its early phase. So yes, there has not been significant structural changes as to how we operate our international business. Obviously in North America, we started our transformation about three years ago, so a significant part of these structural changes have already taken place there, but in the international business, no there has not been any significant impact of structural changes yet.", "Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Okay and I think you mentioned that one of your objectives along with these internal transformational initiatives was to get back to prior cycle consolidated operating margins, which I think for something like 26% to 27% thereabouts. You are 20% today on a consolidated basis. Over what timeframe should we expect that evolution to take place roughly?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "But I\u2019m not going to give you a timeframe here. I mean, we have a horizon of these transformation objectives of plus, minus five years. Exactly when we\u2019re going to hit or if we\u2019re going to hit this targets is too early to say, but we set out quite an ambitious target and that is to get back to previous cycle operating margins and I\u2019m still optimistic and relatively confident that we are going to get there.", "Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Okay, and last one from me. Recently Total came out at its Analyst Day and announced a fairly significant reduction in capital spending over the next two years. And we\u2019ve sort of talked about this before, I mean, the IOCs in deepwater, NOCs are cash flow constrained and it tend on the one hand an opportunity rich on the other hand. So two questions in that particular regard; one, the outlook for seismic and two the outlook for deepwater capital spending in terms of rate of change going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, that\u2019s a lot of questions wrapped into one. But I\u2019ll \u2013 let us start up with the seismic, so maybe I\u2019d say a little bit about our seismic results in Q3 and then on the outlook and then we can go on to the next part of your question right. But Q3 results gross were solid, multi-client was down a bit about 9% sequentially, which was in line with our expectations. In marine, we had a good quarter as expected, fully booked, good pricing from the new technology, but really no further traction on basic pricing and also on land, we had a very good quarter. We have restructured our land business over the past year, focusing now entirely on Unique deployed in Middle East and North Africa and we are now generating very solid operating margins on land, which is as long time since we\u2019ve done.", "Now in terms of the outlook for seismic, as you can see from our disclosure, our backlog is now at $856 million, which is down 12% year-over-year, but this backlogging includes all four parts of our business; the marine, the land, the data processing and the multi-client. So actually the main driver for the year-over-year growth in the backlog is actually land, and that\u2019s basically due to the fact that we have downsized our business and focusing more narrowly on Unique and Middle East and North Africa.", "So the marine backlog was slightly up year-over-year, but the visibility on Q1, Q2 is lower than what we had at the same stage last year. It doesn\u2019t mean that there are no surveys out there, but our customers are now in their planning cycle and they have been reluctant to make early commitment as to these surveys that they have on the table.", "So I would say that we basically expect to gain further visibility on marine seismic activity during the fourth quarter. So there is a bit of uncertainty over that as of now, but I can\u2019t really conclude what that\u2019s going to mean for next year. So overall, the outlook for seismic, for data processing, land and multi-client looks solid, with some lower visibility on marine.", "Now in terms of deepwater, there is \u2013 we\u2019re still quite, I would say, bullish and optimistic on deepwater. There are a number of new rigs coming into the market in Q4 and also going into 2014 and that\u2019s going to grow \u2013 that\u2019s going to drive the deepwater spend in 2014. So we\u2019re still optimistic on deepwater.", "Bill A. Herbert \u2013 Simmons & Co.", "Thank you, sir.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And thanks for that. Paal, I wonder whether you could elaborate a little bit more on what you said on the efficiencies in North America pressure pumping market. Your pitch sounded a little bit increased productivity from the well and reducing the number of stages needed, sounded pretty much like the picture on introduction of highway a little while back. Is it something more than highway gaining foothold?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I think highway is one technology that obviously has applications in the market. As I\u2019ve been saying over the past year or so, we continue to work on other technologies as well. So there is \u2013 while highway increases conductivity in the fractures that we create, this new technology I talked about today, the diversion technology, has a different objective, which is basically to ensure that we access all the perforation clusters along the horizontal section, which the industry basically today does not do.", "So it\u2019s another technology, which in conjunction or in parallel with highway can help to drive production and reduce costs.", "Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. thanks for clarifying. Also on Framo, well, did you account for anything at all this quarter or is it the one quarter delay on how you report the equity income?", "Simon Ayat", "Ole, Simon here. We reported on one-month lag, but it is \u2013 we didn\u2019t report anything during this quarter from Framo. So\u2026", "Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. So that would have added a couple of cents.", "Simon Ayat", "Quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s basically in Q2, we have Framo and in the third quarter, it is part of the venture and it will be reported by the OneSubsea as they consolidate in Cameron.", "Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "Simon Ayat", "What did you say, Ole?", "Ole H. Slorer \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "No, that \u2013 that\u2019s clear. Thanks for clarifying.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Morning. On the North America market, clearly your strength in technology and execution have led to very impressive efficiencies and you noted the deployment of additional frac crews in the U.S. Do you think \u2013 on existing equipment and not using capital, which I think is very interesting, do you think you will be able to continue this in 2014, where in essence, you are adding additional frac crews into the market without adding any and or on-stacking any capacity or adding any capital?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, we don\u2019t plan to add any capital in 2014 based on where we stand now. So if we \u2013 it\u2019s all going to be a function of the amount of works that we will win and the first priority will be to try to address that work through the equipment we already have deployed. and beyond that, we are prepared to activate assets from the idle asset program, if we cannot address the work with the assets already in operation. but I think there is still upside in terms of the efficiency and utilization of the assets we already have in operation.", "Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Great, fair enough, and then as a follow-up to that, clearly, you are seeing significant efficiency gains through execution on the pressure pumping side. Are there other product lines outside of pressure pumping that are particularly apps to be able to drive additional product efficiencies through execution or are there specific regions that you think you could see more of it as you go into 2014 internationally?", "Simon Ayat", "Well, internationally, we continue to drive efficiency through other operations, right. There is no one item that I would single out. I think every product line that we have, all 15 of them, have specific programs and targets where they drive both the efficiency of our workforce as well as the utilization of our assets in all aspects of our operations. So, that's a key part of what you see in terms of the incremental margins that we are generating in the international market.", "Angie M. Sedita \u2013 UBS Securities LLC", "Great. I'll turn it over.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just had one question as it relates to your longer term outlook on Brazil. I know you hadn't always felt like this would be kind of a transition year in the contrary and you remarked 4Q you see activity flat versus third quarter which was down. Can you just give us your more longer term thoughts on Brazil as a whole and how we should expect that unfolding for Schlumberger here next year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I would say that, our view on 2014 overall in Brazil is that it\u2019s going to be another challenging year. And it's mainly down to the activity levels that we see at this stage, which is relatively flat from where we stand now. That's a function of obviously of what Petrobras is planning to do, but also there is some impact in this in lower activity projected for both the Brazilian independents as well as on the IOCs in Brazil in 2014.", "2015 is likely to be higher when the exploration work linked to the last license round is likely to kick in, but the majority of the activity in Brazil next year for us is going to be centered around Petrobras who are not looking to significantly grow activity at least from what we can see at this stage.", "William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.", "Okay. And for you, you feel like you are pretty well balanced in terms of service and equipment capacity in Brazil?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. We are we well set up in Brazil. We have a strong focus on both quality and efficiency and also introduction of new technology for these long-term contracts. So I\u2019m comfortable with our position and our set up in Brazil, it is challenging, but we are executing well.", "William D. Sanchez \u2013 Howard Weil Inc.", "Okay. And that was it from me. I\u2019ll turn it back. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael Kirk LaMotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning guys. I wanted to follow-up Paal on the transformation program and in particular ask you about some of the metrics we can be looking at over the next five years. We tend to focus on top line growth and incremental margins and obviously the margins should improve and you\u2019ve given some good guidance there. But if I think about capital efficiency, can you give us some sense as to where you think ratios such as reinvestment rates, CapEx to revenue, asset turnover, some of the key utilization metrics that might better reflect the doubling of asset utilization and some of the other elements of the program?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I mean, I would reiterate the main indicators that I gave you during my talk in this conference in Q3. We are aiming at doubling asset utilization, which by itself means that we should be able to reduce the CapEx relative to activity in terms of growth going forward. So I\u2019m not going to give you a specific CapEx as a percentage of revenue , other than that, we reduce CapEx in 2013 while we were still growing and my initial, I would say, indication for 2014 would be flat to slightly down on CapEx and that is assuming that we are still going to grow in 2014. So the focus on asset utilization should help us reduce CapEx relative to growth going forward.", "Michael Kirk LaMotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. And then one other point on the financial focus areas, you mentioned cross training of the workforce particularly in remote areas. I'm wondering what that means in terms of new recruitment and thinking about training of \u2013 cross training or existing employees as appose to the recruitment program, university program, et cetera and overall headcount growth?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Right. So, we are not looking in the near-term to change significantly the level of recruiting, because this all cross training and ensuring that we got proper competencies for the people that we do cross train is going to take a little bit of time. So, in the near-term, there is no change, no significant change to the level of recruiting that we are planning to do.", "Michael Kirk LaMotte \u2013 Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Simon Ayat", "Morning.", "Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I guess Paal in your comments you\u2019ve spoken optimistically, bullishly about deepwater development, I understand that and we are looking at the rigs coming in and perhaps thinking similarly. I guess I'm curious if you have pause related to a couple of the events that seem to be at least percolating, I guess of anecdotally, which is in the Gulf of Mexico a bit of swapping out of new in place of older rigs even if they're still deepwater, even if they're still BP. And there perhaps in West Africa and Angola and Nigeria it seems like it's a bit of a backlog in terms of getting some of those rigs signed and under contract. So I guess I\u2019m curious for your thoughts about that. And I imagine you're calibrating that into your comments, but I guess I'm curious if that gives you pause if there is an element where you are a little less encouraged perhaps, because of those kinds of developments?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I\u2019m aware that some of the new arrivals that are coming into the market in 2014 still do not have contracts. But based on what we are hearing from the drilling contractors, they appear confident that these rigs are going to get contracts by the time they arrive. To the other point that you are making, yes maybe some of the older generation rigs will be replaced by the newer generation. But either way, we have a positive view on the market. There were significant growth in deepwater drilling activity in 2011 and we expect the continuation on that trend into 2014.", "Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Fair enough. Okay. An unrelated question, you mentioned in you\u2019re \u2013 the written commentary about Statoil, a couple of nice multi-year contracts, I guess on the fluid side as well as cementing. I think that there are one or if not more of those contracts still outstanding. I wonder if you could speak to us about the lay of the land there if you expect there are some awards that might still come and if you can at all calibrate if the implications for you given the fact that you've won the ones that you've announced?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "You\u2019re talking about Statoil Norway?", "Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I'm not aware of any major outstanding contracts beyond the ones that we have \u2013 that's already been awarded earlier this year as well as the ones that we are referencing now. But I would say overall our position in Norway and our position with Statoil is strong from where we see it and we're well positioned there.", "Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Very good, okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Robin Shoemaker with Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead.", "Robin E. Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Thank you. So, Paal, could you give us idea now of what percentage of your fracturing stages are employing the leading edge technologies such as Highway and this recent innovation that you mentioned on the diversion of perforation clusters. I mean what kind of percentage are we talking about here of total stages fracked?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So, we haven't disclosed what percentage of stages are done with highway. The only thing I would say is that we have seen continuous growth in Highway stages throughout this year and the year-over-year growth is very significant as well. So, we continue to penetrate the market on highway. But we haven't been disclosing what percentage of our own stages we are doing highway on.", "And on the other technology I referenced, this is the technology that is in field test. So, it is very limited what the deployment is and it's not yet commercialized. So, I would say that this is something that we are trying out. There is still a fair bit of field testing done before we are potentially going to commercialize it. But I wanted to share with you this technology, because it is interesting and the early field test results are showing great promise.", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Okay. And just staying on that theme, you had mentioned in some of your earlier kind of outlines of the evolution of highway and other fracking technologies that you could eventually come to a point where you might not be necessarily providing the fracturing fleets themselves, but more providing technology for the fracking operations. Is there any \u2013 how far have we advanced towards that possible goal and is it in the foreseeable future?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "What you are referencing is what we call this Spark model this is basically where we provide the fracturing fluid, the engineering, the blending while we have a third-party providing the horsepower. So we have deployed this business model with a number of customers who are vertically integrated in North America, but the overall business volume is I would say is not significant but it's continued to grow this year from where it was last year when we introduced it. And similarly, we have also deployed this business model for part of our operations in China.", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "I see, okay. Thanks very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We will go to Waqar Syed with Goldman, Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Thank you very much. Paal just following upon highway are there any particular basins in the North America where highway has had the best penetration and could you outline which ones are those?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I would say the basin where we have had the most success and where the penetration is the deepest is in the Eagle Ford. So we have a significant number of wells and stages down there over the past couple of years and also I think a fair bit of data indicating the results that highway can bring both in terms of higher production and recovery and lower cost in terms of pumping less propane.", "Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Now is it something to do with the geology of the basin or the structure of the formation or this technology is applicable in or effective in every basin?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well generally, we believe its applicable in every basin I think what you find is that there are two main applications of highway. One is to increase conductivity so you thereby increase production and recovery. And the other one is that you reduce cost because in general we pump about 40% less [propant] per job which is a cost saving.", "So, what we found that is that in Eagle Ford, we have both a significant production recovery increase together with the cost savings. While the production increases we have not seen the same level of production increases in some of the other basins, which is partly down to the geology as you reference it right. But in general we have not seen \u2013 we've always seen I would say a flat or higher production and we generally always see lower costs. So it's just a matter of the technology uptake taking a bit of time when you look at a large market like North America land.", "Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Sure. And then just on, in terms of your efficiency improvements how they are having an impact on the margins, could you quantify for us what the margin impact has been in North America because of these efforts. And if you didn't have those efforts where the margins would have been?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I can't really give you a number on that. I mean, the efficiency improvements going all the way back three years to when we started restructuring the land business is obviously a key part of the performance that we continue to post quarter-after-quarter. But at the same time, we have a very strong offshore business both in Gulf of Mexico and Eastern Canada and we also have a very strong business in Alaska.", "So it\u2019s a combination of everything where we needed to improve the most going back three years was in North America land and there has been a significant improvement there. But at the same time, we have continued to progress on our offshore and high-end business as well.", "Waqar Syed \u2013 Goldman, Sachs & Co.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Good morning guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Paal geographically and product lines, your incrementals are through the roof and that's fabulous. Where geographically and what product lines typically generate the highest incrementals?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think if you are talk about international market, I think we had great results basically in all regions, I would say takeaway Latin America at this stage in terms of incrementals right. We managed to keep margins flat in Latin America in a very challenging business environment and mainly driven by the headwinds or challenges in Brazil and Mexico while the business in the other countries in Latin America progressed very well. So the incremental margins were driven by ECA and the Middle East and the Far East.", "In terms of product lines, obviously characterization continues to do well. I mean their incremental margins were not as high this quarter but they have been progressing very well year-over-year and so far this year. But both drilling and production continues to do very well. So I can't really single out one specific product line internationally other than that all of them are doing very well and together they come together extremely well.", "Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay. My follow-up, if I could, is Brazil has been a difficult year for everybody this year and it maybe next year. What percentage of your Latin American revenues generally come from Brazil these days with the contract wins you have?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We haven't disclosed that. So I\u2019m not going to...", "Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Is it your biggest market in Latin America?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It\u2019s not our biggest market in Latin America.", "Jim K. Wicklund \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ll go to Holm Turner with RS Platou Markets. Please go ahead.", "Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS", "Yes. Hi, guys. Just a question on the operational delays that you had in this quarter. It sounds like much of that came in offshore Africa, I was just curious if you could give us a bit more color on that. Was the delayed in new builds coming out of the yards or was it more on the operator side? and related to that, do you think you can get most of that work back in 4Q and if so, maybe see a bit stronger sequential progression that you would typically expect seasonally?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think the Q2 operational delays was really the sum of all the things you mentioned. Some of the rigs delayed coming from the yard, then you've got to commission them and get them started off and then it's having everything ready from the customer side to start operations. Right. So no one thing impacting it. But there was a significant planned influx of rigs and there were delays with several aspects of it which is not uncommon for these types of markets. In terms of Q4, there will be some improvement in Q4, but I think it's going to go into Q1, Q2 before everything is ironed out.", "Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS", "Yes. Okay, alright. And just to change gears a little bit. I was just wondering if you could comment on the growth in the Arctic market. There is a lot of things going on there, you have Exxon Rosneft kicking off a drilling campaign in the Kara Sea next year, there is increasing activity in the Norwegian side of the barrens and talk of doing some work on the Russian side and of course there is Cairn and Greenland and also some Alaska work. So just curious if you can talk about the opportunity in the Arctic in terms of service intensity and sort of your expectation for how quickly that market can become significant for Schlumberger?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "That's a good question. I think we see Arctic as a interesting market and a good opportunity going forward. We are, I think, very well positioned to take part in that in particularly in Russia, we're already involved in one Arctic project there Prirazlomnaya. At the same time we are also actively pursuing the other projects that are coming up both in, like to say, Greenland as well as other places in Russia and North America and Norway. So in terms of overall impact and activity, I think it's going to take a bit of time before it becomes really material. But there is a significant potential there that we are going to actively position ourselves to take part in.", "Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS", "Okay. Thanks. And last other thing is that, your two largest competitors talking about sort of 10% E&P spending growth next year in North America. Would you kind of echo that sentiment? And if so, I was just curious if you\u2019re position in the Gulf of Mexico would give you the expectation that you might grow a bit faster than whatever the E&P spending comes in, in North America next year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, I think it's too early to comment on specific growth numbers for any part of the world next year, given the fact that our customers are still in their planning cycle. I am optimistic though that we'll see growth in North America in terms of spend next year and potentially higher than what we saw this year. But beyond that I\u2019m not ready to give you a number at this stage.", "Holm Turner \u2013 RS Platou Markets AS", "Okay. All right, thanks guys. I'll turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Malcolm Theobald", "On behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I'd like to thank you participating in today's call. And John will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this conference is available through replay.

Please go ahead.", "", "Malcolm Theobald", "Thank you, John. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2013 results conference call. Joining us on the call today are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document, which is available on our website or upon request. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "And now, I will turn the call over to Simon.", "", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.35. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and is $0.31 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter, we recorded a $0.09 charge relating to a provision of accounts receivable in connection with the client in Brazil who filed for bankruptcy during the quarter.", "Fourth quarter revenue of $11.9 billion increased 2.6% sequentially. Of this $298 million sequential increase, the vast majority came from the year-end surge in software product and multi-client sales that we typically experienced in the Q4. Oilfield Services pre-tax income of $2.6 billion increased 4.3% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margin increased by 37 basis points to 21.9% largely due to the positive effects of the previously mentioned seasonal year-end sales.", "Sequential revenue and pre-tax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization group revenue of $3.2 billion increased 1% while margin improved 132 basis points to 31.7%. These increases were driven by traditionally strong end of year software and multi-client sales offset in part by the seasonal decline in the WesternGeco Marine activity and the conclusion of several higher margin exploration projects.", "Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.5 billion increased 1.9% while margin declined by 69 basis points to 19.6%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to robust M-I SWACO and IPM activity in the Middle East and Asia area, while the margin decline was finally due to an over less favorable revenue mix.", "Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of $4.2 billion increased 4.8% as a result of robust Completion and Artificial Lift product sales and pre-tax margin declined by 27 basis points to 17.3% as the impact of stronger results from our Schlumberger production management projects and end of year product sale was more than offset by continued pricing pressure in U.S. land. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 22.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.7% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $4.4 billion representing an improvement of $1.2 billion as compared to end of Q3. Most notably we spent almost $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during the quarter. We repurchased 11.9 million shares at an average price of $18.67 during the quarter. In addition during the quarter we took advantage of the low interest rate environment by issuing $1.5 billion of 3.65% 10-year notes and \u20ac500 million 1.5% 5-year notes.", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of approximately $1.2 billion. We were quite pleased with our working capital performance during the quarter. From a cash flow perspective we generated approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operation during all of 2013. This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities which we did by completing various acquisitions and investment in other companies most significantly our investment in (indiscernible) and investing $4.3 billion in CapEx and multi-client. While at the same time returning $4.2 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases during the year. During the full year 2013 we repurchased 31.3 million shares at an average price of $82.82. From for a total of $2.6 billion while paying out $1.6 billion in dividend. As it relates to 2014 CapEx is expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013. We expect the EPR for the full year 2014 to be in the low to mid-20s however this can vary on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings.

And first go to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "You have made a big push an emphasis on returns on capital efficiency of your previous two quarterly calls in particular and we can see the results now some pretty strong free cash flow as a percentage both of sales and EBITDA but can you talk just a little bit as to how much more efficiency is there squeezed out of the system now? Because you seem to have come quite a long way already.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I mean as you see from my numbers and as you point out, we have stepped our focus on cash generation this year. We have put a lot more emphasis in that throughout the entire management and even it's starting to pay out. Now in the first three quarters of 2013 we generated around $3 billion of free cash flow and in Q4 alone we generated 2.5 billion on top of that which is the new quarterly record right? So the key drivers I think is both, it's management focus on working capital and asset utilization and we want to continue to perform over that into 2014. We indicated that on CapEx next year is going to be around $3.8 billion and the continued growth in the top line and the bottom line and I\u2019m optimistic that reaching further step up the generation of free cash flow. It's essential how we manage our cash flow. Simon do you want to, a few things on that?", "Simon Ayat", "", "So basically if you look at our cash flow generation the last couple of years we suffered a bit from the increase in working capital and the increase in working capital as we have mentioned before was our way of setting up all the Smith acquisition that we made in order to distribute the product further worldwide. The current performance that we have seen is back to normal and I think we will continue to be performing very well as far as the working capital efficiency and as Paal mentioned we are finally got to a point where our CapEx as a percentage of revenue at a manageable level and I think the cash flow generation will continue to be strong as you\u2019ve seen it in 2013.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "What is it in your business that gives you confidence that you can take CapEx down while your revenue is increasing? I mean that\u2019s something which sort of no other company has not been able to do.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "", "By coming down to some of the elements that we have discussed around the internal transformation. There is a lot of focus and lot of things we\u2019re doing to guide asset efficiency or asset utilization that revolves around better sharing between locations you know quicker turnaround in maintenance and a better transportation network setup as well. So, yes we\u2019re going to continue to grow in 2014 an we\u2019re taking CapEx slightly down and I think I\u2019m quite comfortable with really different [ph] levels we\u2019re making in the in-line growth with higher than what we anticipate. We have the option of further increasing CapEx but as of the $3.8 billion number that I\u2019m indicating I\u2019m quite comfortable with.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "", "Just little clarification Paal you didn\u2019t sound particularly upbeat about general pricing trends, either in North America or international for kind of commodity and the type of services. Yes you highlighted but in your case if I heard you correctly you had a 5% positive pricing indicator because of technology and again, could you kind of elaborate a little bit on exactly what you mean by that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well the revenues were rich indicators basically we talked to revenue we generate for the unit rig activity and but using more revenue earnings well obviously that house [ph] but also by substituting existing basic technologies with new technologies really command the pricing premium that basically helps drive that indicator out. So on average in 2013 that revenue for pricing indicator grew by 5% over 2012 which obviously helps both in the top-line and on the bottom line.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", " ", "Okay you also highlighted the higher price contracts rolling off, how do you see 2014 kind of the headwind there and the tailwind on your technology and ability to push more value as through products offering.", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well if you look at 2013 it's one of the highest years we have had in new technologies both in new technologies that we were introduced over past years and we track it very (indiscernible) and also the technologies that were introduced in the past five years which we also track very closely. So we have a number of new technologies that came on 2013 and a similar number is not even higher coming up in 2014. So we will continue to leverage what we have introduced in the past year and also augment it a significant number of new technologies coming out in 2014. So I\u2019m quite positive and optimistic that through the new technology introductions we can continue to drive the effective pricing up. Now big contracts like for instance we saw in Mexico recently it's continue to be a big, quite aggressively and competitively on the basic pricing but having a number of new technologies that we\u2019re introducing we should be able to continue to our improve that revenue for rig pricing indicator.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities", "", "Paal can I follow-up on the comment that you made about the new technology on the fracturing side. You commented the lesson of two things one just fracture stage effectiveness and two I guess in propagation but the technology platform that\u2019s looking to be rolled out this year looks to be more than just fluids involving the hardware et cetera. Can you expand upon that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "", "With further comments on the Broadband family until we have completed the key testing and the commercialization milestones. The few things I mentioned are around high precision fracturing where we cross address each perforation cluster as well as having finished with which better control to sort of coupling. There will be technologies in this family that will advance those, there might be some other things there is lot of we will talk about that when we have firmed out the key testing and we\u2019re ready to roll it out.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities", "Okay but it's fair to assume at this point that it really is sort of an end to end solution as opposed to a single point solution the way highway was introduced. Is that a fair characterization?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "That is fair to assume, yes.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities", "Okay great. And Simon, quick one for you, the working capital frankly I have never seen a $45 billion revenue company use almost no working capital for the course of 12 months. First of all congratulations on that and second one is that something you can expect to continue in \u201914 and what have been the major levers that have brought that about this year?", "Simon Ayat ", "So as I mentioned thanks Michael for the comment first of all and as I mentioned in the last couple of years we were gearing up the acquisition of Smith in terms of strength in their level of inventories and (indiscernible). So it's consumed more than lot more [ph] in terms of working capital. The working capital performance is here obviously resulted also from collecting and improving our receivable you know performance. Going forward it should be back to normal, it should be less than the previous two years but I cannot promise you it would be the performance of this year and hopefully we will maintain it but you know growth always consume a bit of working capital. So you can assume it would back to normal not the level of the last couple of year\u2019s consumption and it will be continue to be efficient because entire organization is basically focused on sharply to improve the working capital performance.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities", "Okay so when you say back to normal I mean is it still 1% of revenue plus or minus?", "Simon Ayat", "That would be yes more or less the case.", "Operator", "Next we will go to David Anderson with JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan Securities", "", "So Paal you were talking about your expectation for about I think I believe I heard 6% kind of overall E&P spend, guidance of earnings up double-digits. Can you talk a bit about how much that earnings improvement in \u201914 is going to be related to the internal transformation on the efficiency and the asset turns?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "While if you look at the solid double digit growth in earnings per share it's kind of a combination of the two (indiscernible). So we aim to grow our foot line faster than the growth in the E&P spend. This is going to be driven by new technology which we just talked about but also the quality of our service and our integration capability. But we all plan to continue to expand margins even in a challenging pricing environment. That\u2019s going to be driven by our execution efficiency and our ongoing transformation in the program. So how much is going to come from each, we obviously have a very clear on view I\u2019m not going to go into the detail probably but I think both of them will be very good contributors.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan Securities", "In your outlook I was just curious the market has been on focused on some of the IOCs having some budget cuts out there I think (indiscernible). Some of the other IOCs their cuts have been feeding really market concerns about offshore and development spending, can you help us put this into perspective I think I heard you say about the infrastructure but can you talk about how that\u2019s looking right there in terms of their pure upstream spending and maybe kind of collectively I mean would you just think that the offshore spending will be up at least mid-single digits? I mean it just seems like we\u2019re hearing kind of different stories in different parts of the market.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah if you look at the comment I made on tool for E&P spend, this is expected to be around 6% and that\u2019s really based on the third party survey. So at the average of that, they will come in around that level. Within the 6% as I said the international growth somewhat north of 6% and NAM growth somewhat below. But now while the industry focus is on the total E&P spend what is really driving our business is the well related E&P spend. So we actually have our own spend model which is entirely focused on well related E&P spend and this is a global model and it's based on well count, well price, well cost by cost I mean by countries [ph], whether either complete role as part of our planning process and this model suggests that the well related spend will grow faster than the 6% and that\u2019s really what I\u2019m basing my comments on. As within that outlook offshore and deep water continues to look solid. So and in this model the valuation and spend growth from the Super Mega\u2019s to the IOCs to the independents and the NOCs is all part of it. So in these comments those valuations are captured.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies", "", "If I could I guess follow-up on that if perhaps you can give us some perspective because part of what I think is raised concern among investment community is the lack of contracts recently for deep water rigs for example casting somewhat of a shadow on the what had been the fairly obvious trajectory for a deep water activity growth. Do you have any thoughts on the nature of that and then presumably there is a release of a lot of the contracts that you would envision happening soon?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Yeah first of all we saw strong growth on deep water activity in 2013 and we expect to see also solid growth in 2014. But as you point out the drilling activity and the rig scheduled for deep water could be impacted by some of these ongoing commercial discussion. There is a number of rig contract coming up for renegotiation as you indicate and also some of the new arrivals who not yet have contract but in rig contractors that we talk whom seem confident that the new rigs will be contracted basically because of the higher operating efficiency that they have but the contract excursions [ph] could have an impact on the day rate for the other generation rigs, not now. We have factored these elements into again into our outlook so we\u2019re not overly worried about what that mean from an operational perspective for us.", "Brad Handler \u2013 Jefferies", "Understand, okay. Maybe it's a related follow-up maybe it isn't but the conversation has shifted to sort of an overall level of spending from what had been a mixed conversation a little bit ago but I wouldn\u2019t mind coming back to that the mix of exploration versus development. In your modeling as you see \u201914 playing out, so a two part question first is there a discernible mix that you look for and then in a sense the second part of the question is does it matter as we look at some of your what I think are some of your higher margin businesses on the exploration side if there is to be a move away from that, how much can you mention seismic in or seismic was mentioned by your colleague earlier. How much of any of that matter? That mix shift if you see it coming for \u201914?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Basically we have a very broad and well-balanced portfolio. So these shifts they might have small impact but overall I\u2019m not overly worried about that going into 2014. With respect to exploration we still see growth in exploration in 2014. It's going to be lower than the roughly 10% that growth that we saw in 2013 but still decent growth. Now in terms of the nature of the growth in exploration we expect this to be more well related again so we\u2019re pretty clear that the flattening of the pricing spend is happening. There has been a lot of data acquired in recent years. So the growth in exploration is going to be more well related than exploration related and well that is that means that it's a more challenging environment for WesternGeco it still bodes well for our Wireline well testing and drilling product line. So of course they called in the balance.", "Operator", "And next we will go to James West with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "So Paal I think we have gone beat up the E&P spend numbers globally and it's clear that you guys intend to grow faster than 6%. Maybe if I turn to one of the markets I guess it's been more troubling for the industry which is North America. We\u2019re looking at least at some acceleration or some increase in spend in North America pricing obviously still weakish but do you think with this pickup in activity that\u2019s envisioned, you hit a point where these product lines that had been at a balance can start to come back into balance and maybe pricing is no longer that much of a concern?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well we would like if that happen but if you referred to the fracturing if I go like fracturing there is still today significant industry overcapacity of horsepower. So at this stage we do not expect the market to reach equilibrium in 2014. Now in terms of activity for North America you expect solid growth in activity on land in 2014 and a lot of this is still going to be driven by further improvements in drilling and fracking efficiency. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we do not see any significant combat in in dry gas (indiscernible). So if you look at the trends that you saw in 2013 I think they are continuing into 2014 and North America last is going to be I think more of a same.", "James West - Barclays Capital", "And then maybe a perhaps on related follow-up but talking about your technology pipeline it sounds like there is acceleration in new technology introductions. Are these more focused on the U.S. land market as you kind of highlighted some of the stuffs that you\u2019re testing right now or is this global and you just choose to highlight the North America technology?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "It's more than up against, I choose to focusing on North America because this is where I think technology will have a significant impact in terms of how the market is going to be shaped going forward. We talked about that on previous calls. We obviously have a broad I would say portfolio of new technologies coming out also addressing the international markets with the range of businesses we all present but I choose to highlight North America land and attracting on the coal.", "Operator", "Our next question is from (indiscernible). Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Paal I appreciate the comment especially on the near term outlook for 1Q and the seasonality, I was curious so if we think about adding back the negative impact you saw on fourth quarter for Iraq. We thought about first quarter Middle-East Asia margins let\u2019s say should we assume that add back of revenue and the attaining profitability at least offsets whatever multi-client excuse me you\u2019re in product sales that you lose traditionally in the first quarter so perhaps maybe revenue flattish margins flattish is opposed to down in Middle-East Asia for 1Q?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well the question is to if you want to welcome to give you a specific number or go much more in detail. I would say the change the sequential change both in revenues and margins in both environment I think is going to be more and less in line in what you see at an average over the past couple of years. So there are a lot of moving parts in our business and the way we see we do want to at this stage that is going to be more or less at normal seasonal growth that we see.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay my follow-up Simon will be for you. I guess with the dividend raise now by looking consensus numbers for \u201914 the dividend is coming by a 28% of net income, is there a target range that you guys have as a management team or as a Board that we should be thinking about longer term here in terms of where that dividend potentially can go as a percentage of net income.", "Simon Ayat", "You know if you look back on several years now, we look at our dividend every year in January and we decide based on the level of activity, the cash flow where we\u2019re going to be as far as the dividend is concerned. The 28% this is on the higher side and reflect the new level of cash flows that we are at and we will continue to be but there is no target number for the dividend. We will look at it every year and we will reflect basically on the condition of the business and the growth in the cash flow but there is target number.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And Simon do we just, should we view the assumption of debt during the quarter specifically just to fund the share repurchase program and is that something that we should expect to continue and what is still a little interest rate environment?", "Simon Ayat", "Frankly we don\u2019t need to borrow to fund the repurchase, we did the borrowing to take advantage of the lower interest rate which as you know kind of climbed the business during the quarter so we did it at the right time and we have some maturing that\u2019s coming in the first half of 2014 which we will use this excess cash to bring it down.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert \u2013 Simmons", "With regards to 2014 I\u2019m not sure if you made mention of this or not yet but with regard to your international margins in \u201913 incremental were kind of 40% to 45% in that range for last year. Should we expect much the same in 2014 with regard to international incremental margins?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well we want to try I can\u2019t promise but we have a lot of drivers that we\u2019re working on to which is kind of you know puts us to try to refuse that. But now it's going to come down to a number of things but the new technology introduction and a further improvement in efficiency and quality are one of the key drivers. So, I can\u2019t promise but we\u2019re certainly going to try.", "Bill Herbert \u2013 Simmons", "Okay and secondly back to the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter, if I look at that what you guys have done over the past 5-6 years on average earnings per share is down a low double digit percentage, quarter-on-quarter is that what we should be expecting or modeling for the first quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well what number did you say?", "Bill Herbert \u2013 Simmons", "A low double digit percentage quarter-on-quarter.", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Yeah I would say plus minus 10% is the rough, is the average of the past 3-4 years, yeah", "Bill Herbert \u2013 Simmons", "Okay so that a buck 20 an buck 21 I know you\u2019re not endorsing a specific number but that\u2019s not necessarily an implausible place to start for at Q1.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It is implausible but I will stick to the number that I gave you more well which is look at the previous years and do not (indiscernible).", "", "Operator", "And next go to Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Securities", "", "Paal could you give us a little further color on the North American price weakness, obviously we had seasonality in Q4 and what are you seeing in Q1? Is it too earlier to tell or do you think those stay continued price weakness into 2014?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "So season for us we would have appropriate impact in pricing in Q1 that\u2019s mainly down to the renegotiation and rollover of all the certain contract that we have. So we believe that a few of them during Q4 with some impact in Q4 we get a full impact of those in Q1 and the other contract as well that will probably impact in Q1 to a certain extent. So that\u2019s dated for the kind of pricing comments that I already made.", " ", "Angie Sedita - UBS Securities", "All right and then on the overcapacity kind of in reference to James question certainly going to be able to, the capacity in 2014, is your thoughts that we will certainly see that in 2015 as well based on the market condition as we see it today?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well I think I will focus my comments on \u201914 for now and things can move fast in North America land but we\u2019re pretty confident that we will not reach equilibrium in 2014.", "Angie Sedita - UBS Securities", "And then as I\u2019m really a follow-up on Mexico, congratulations currently on the market share gains. Some color there on when you expect to mobilize equipment or actually start activity in Mexico and then comments on Mexico longer term. Obviously expectations for the region are fairly high, is it still too early to tell how meaningful Mexico will be or are you becoming more confident on Mexico?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "As I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks the early indication for these (indiscernible) we will have a pretty solid market share gain. Now these contracts are not finalized yet, they will be finalized during the first quarter. We expect to mobilize the additional resources that we need to take on the additional work during Q2 and that we will get into kind of full operation on these contracts in the second half of the year. So we still see H1 [ph] activity to be somewhat challenging partly due to the (indiscernible) slowdown but I think H2 [ph] will be better for us given the market share gains. Now with respect to the and as you recall obviously the net profits for the industry in Mexico but the earlier impact on our activity will be 2015.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Crandell with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities", "", "Well the Chinese companies CNOOC, PetroChina seem to be estimating a lot lower growth in E&P CapEx in 2014. Do you expect that as well and can you characterize which is just being in terms of the awards and business coming out of the Chinese companies?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well we continue to see strong growth and activity for us throughout in China on land and this is driven by both conventional price gaps and there are certain expense (indiscernible) right, so partially this is through the market penetration for us. There is lot better demand now for our new technology, for our fracking expertise and also for our further management capability. So I still the overall I still think China as one of the fastest growing geo-market for us in 2014 as it was in 2013. I have a pretty positive outlook on China for the coming year.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen Securities", "Okay and then my follow-up is if you could comment on Brazil you had some cautionary comments about Brazil. I assume you\u2019re forecasting a lower level of business out of Brazil. If that\u2019s true what kind of drop do you see in business there for either drop in the market or drop in business for Schlumberger in 2014?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "I would say overall rig activity we expect to be flat in 2014 which is going to be another challenging year. Exactly what\u2019s going to happen (indiscernible) I\u2019m not going to going reach out there but it will be a challenging year you know coping with the frac activity which is obviously lower than what we were expecting going back 12 to 18 months.", "Operator", "And we will go to Jeff Tillery with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "", "In the release you mentioned a couple of operational startup delays in the drilling group. Could you give us just some color on which geo-markets that may have been impacted as well as the timing of those startups when you see some this impact projects?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "I don\u2019t have the detail for those available (indiscernible). So I can\u2019t comment on them and follow-up maybe Jeff.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "Okay and then how should we think about from a top down standpoint measuring the progress Schlumberger makes on some of the cost and efficiency initiatives in \u201914? Do we just watch that through the margin line or through incremental or what\u2019s an external measuring sticks we can use to judge you by?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well I think both the margin probably is going to be a good measure of it, it think also it will have some impact on our ability to generate the free cash flow. So I think both of those are good yardsticks to look at.", "Operator", "We will go to Scott Gruber with Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Scott Gruber \u2013 Bernstein", "Just one quick one from me, Simon can you provide some color on the CapEx trends in North America versus rest of the world and where you\u2019re spending it down equally or is it weighted toward one region?", "Simon Ayat", "It's really in-line with the rest of the world. I mean you know last year it was lower because obviously the pressure pumping is consuming less as we have consumed some of the excess equipment. Exact figure I don\u2019t know ready with me but I will follow-up with you on this.", "Scott Gruber - Bernstein", "But there is you know I was thinking of the international side there is no bigger drop on the international side versus domestic at this point?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "If you look at 2013 we obviously stayed back significantly in North America due to basically hardly any CapEx required for pressure pumping. So I think what you see going into 2014 is an more even increased North America versus international and obviously we included in North America to growth of Mexico where we see had price significant growth and these services are also quite capital intensive.", "Operator", "And we will go to Jud Bailey with ISI Group. Please go ahead.", "Jud Bailey - ISI Group", "", "I wanted to follow-up on Latin America that was difficult market for Schlumberger and for the rest of the industry in 2013 although you still have to grow margins. With the Mexico work ramping up, with Argentina growing how much of a pickup in growth can we see in 2014? If you grew low single digits in this year or last year rather is that a market that can grow high single digits with Mexico coming back and Argentina growing or is that a stretch?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Jud we typically don\u2019t comment on details kind of growth outlook for either but I would say that we\u2019re aiming to grow in Latin American in 2014. What level I can\u2019t really comment on.", "Jud Bailey - ISI Group", "And just another question, you were able to like as I mentioned grow margins pretty nicely despite a difficult market in Latin American last year. You mentioned cutting cost in Brazil given your cost structure down. Can you comment maybe on how to think about margins in Latin America for 2014? Does it stay kind of soft until activity in Mexico starts to pick back up?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "", "I think in the third couple of quarters given the challenging activity levels, both in Brazil and Mexico, across the [ph] mobilization as we probably say in Q2 in Mexico there will be challenges now we\u2019re going to work very hard on keeping the margins where they are but there are some headwinds we\u2019re dealing with. Now on the flip side of that we have very strong businesses in terms of growth perspectives in Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela. So while we have headwinds continue in Mexico and Brazil, we obviously are going to do what we have to kind of offset those with the strong performances in those three countries.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Robin Shoemaker with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Robin Shoemaker \u2013 Citi", "Paal you mentioned that you\u2019ve seen price weakness across most product lines in North America. I wonder among all your product service lines and drill bits and fluids and LWD, MWD et cetera where are you seeing relative pricing stability in contrast to areas that are weakening?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "In North America.", "Robin Shoemaker - Citi", "In North America, yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Yeah I think for both of the product lines we\u2019re seeing continuous pricing challenges. I would say the only one that has kind of stood out as a positive and that\u2019s very much driven I would say new technology introduction is actually a good thing. So but the other ones given the market conditions are all facing pricing challenges.", "Robin Shoemaker - Citi", "Okay and you highlighted artificial lift as an area of focus in the shale play. Now obviously a lot of the and the lot of the shale plays that have lower productivity wells, ESP Technology is not generally employed. So what is Schlumberger solutions that you\u2019re working for lower productivity wells?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well what we have done over the past couple of quarters which I had in my prepared remarks is basically that we are both in number of smaller Broadcom [ph] companies for the key liquids shale basins both in the U.S. and Canada. So our plan is to combine the offering from the biggest Broadcom [ph] companies with our existing artificial lift business and then the objective is then to provide a life of well lift solution to the customer base. So we will do that by looking at what is the idea of lift or ESPs and lot of technologies to optimize production and we\u2019re going to obviously leverage our production adhering expertise and our ability to monitor and integrate the production based on from these wells.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Edward Muztafago with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.", "Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale", "", "I did have one follow-up question on sort of the incoming rigs and specifically as it relates to the Gulf of Mexico. There has been a little bit of chatter recently that while there is a fairly large influx of rigs coming in and we may see a little bit exodus out of the Gulf as well and I guess what I\u2019m wondering is on a net basis does the exodus you know sort of the lower specification, shallower water rigs have material effect on Schlumberger or you know do you think that because you\u2019re little bit more deep water focus does that say on that\u2019s less of a concern?", "Paal Kibsgaard ", "Well when I comment on the Gulf of Mexico my comments are generally focused on deep water which is obviously a large part of one operation and so while there might be some offshore rigs we\u2019re still quite optimistic in terms of the rig projections and the results for the Gulf of Mexico or deep water in particular for 2014 and that\u2019s what I\u2019m basing the outlook on.", "Edward Muztafago - Societe Generale", "And then this is kind of a follow-up to the revenue per rig discussions in North America, you know obviously one of the things that we have seen as the well count go up fairly dramatically in relation to rigs and so I haven't run the numbers I\u2019m hoping maybe you will have but if we were to actually look at sort of revenue per well, is it probably a better metric. Do we see the same sort of trend between Schlumberger revenue as you would with rigs but maybe to a lesser degree that is the technology upscale has driven some atypical improvement in that metric.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "", "So for the revenue per well in North America land I don\u2019t have that data available at this stage. I would still say that that\u2019s probably you know not up as much as the 5% in terms of global revenue, international revenue that I was referring to. So there is continuous negative pricing pressure in North America. So I would say revenue per well is probably more challenged than revenue per rig over a quarter.", "Malcolm Theobald", "", "Okay that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. So now on behalf of the Schlumberger management team I would like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. I would like to also personally thank you for your support. John will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this conference is available through replay.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2014 results conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Paris, where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the information in today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after our prepared statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.37. This is an increase of $0.16 sequentially and is $0.22 higher when compared to the same quarter last year, represents increases of 13% and 19% respectively.", "During the quarter, we recorded $205 million charge in discontinued operations relating to the potential resolution with the governmental authorities concerning historical matter. Please refer to the supplement information contained in our earnings press release for further details. Second quarter revenue of $12.1 billion increased 7.3% sequentially. Pre-tax operating income increased 10.7% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 67 basis points to 21.7%.", "Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir characterization revenue of $3.1 billion increased 8.5% and pre-tax income grew by almost 18%. This resulted in margins improving by 233 basis points to 29.7%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in wireline, improved WesternGeco marine utilization, and an increase in SIS software sales.", "Drilling group revenue of $4.7 billion increased 7.4% and margin improved by 74 basis points to 21.1%. These increases were largely attributable to robust international activity in M-I SWACO and strong drilling and measurement activity in North America and Russia.", "Production group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 5.5%. This growth was led by well services as a strong performance internationally and in U.S. land more than compensated for the impact of the spring breakup in Canada. Margins declined by 123 basis points to 16.7% primarily as a result of pressure pumping commodity inflation combined with the impact of the Canadian spring breakup.", "Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.7% in the second quarter compared to 22.6% in the previous quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2014 to be in the low to mid 20s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business. During the quarter, we generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations. For the first six months of this year, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This compares to $3.8 billion for the first six months of 2013.", "As we have mentioned at our Investors Day, our investment in SPM business have now reached a point that\u2019s starting this year. We have begun to report them separately in our cash flow statement, similar to the way we report CapEx and multi-client. While this change has no impact on our free cash flow, it does result in an increase in the amount of cash flow from operations that we report.", "Net debt increased $1 billion during the quarter to $6.1 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of stock repurchases, $522 million of dividend payments, and $922 million of CapEx, excluding multi-client and SPM. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.5 million shares at an average price of $101.85. CapEx, including multi-client and SPM, is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the $3.9 billion we spent in 2013.", "And now, I will turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong and fully in line with our expectations as international activity rebounded in Russia, Norway and Australia and North American activity grew in both offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and on land in spite of the Canadian spring breakup.", "As a result, second quarter revenue grew 7% sequentially and 8% year-on-year while pre-tax operating income increased by 11% sequentially and 15% year-on-year. Year-to-date, we continued to show solid growth in all our main financial indicators compared to last year, with revenue and operating income growing by 7% and 18% respectively, pre-tax margins expanding by 191 basis points, earnings per share increasing by 22% and the incremental margins at a solid 48%. Several factors are contributing to the strength of this performance. These include additional market share gains at the back of new technology sales and operational efficiency as well as further support from strong quality cost and resource management throughout our global operations.", "Our overall financial results continued to demonstrate our leadership in technology, reliability, efficiency and integration, which formed the four components of our engine of outperformance that we detailed at our June investor conference in New York and which will continue to drive our corporate performance in the years to come. In the second quarter, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow bringing the year-to-date number to $1.9 billion, which is 35% higher than for the same period last year. The strength of our cash flow reinforces the confidence we have in the financial targets we laid out at our June conference and will also enable us to further invest in the business while increasing the cash we returned to our shareholders.", "Our international business continued to perform well in the second quarter with seasonal rebound of activity coupled with growth in key markets leading to an 8% sequential increase in revenue, while pre-tax operating margin expanded by 122 basis points to reach 24%, a level not seen since the pre-financial crisis peak of 2008. Compared to the second quarter of last year, international revenue was up 7% when adjusting for Framo on the back of strong growth in the Middle East in Asia and in Europe, Africa.", "In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive and we have still not seen any signs of a general pricing inflection. However, our latest technology and our best-in-class service quality continue to carry a premium, which together with the growth in integration related activity is reflected in our strong top line and margin performance. The premium in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and efficiency puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets which we are using to drive both market share gains and further expand margins.", "In Latin America, revenue was up 5% sequentially while margins were essentially flat with the previous quarter at 21.2%. Compared to the second quarter last year Latin America revenue was down 3% driven by Brazil and Mexico where the impact of lower activity on pricing were only partly offset by the strong activity in Argentina, Ecuador and Venezuela. Pretax operating margins however, was up 62 basis points due to careful cost and resource management as well as our broad and diverse business portfolio in the region. The stronger sequential revenue growth was recorded in Venezuela where we also renewed our payment agreement with PdVSA during the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year our revenues in Venezuela this quarter was up significantly while we at the same time have reduced both DSO and the absolute value of our receivables.", "In Argentina the strong sequential growth was driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale where we are now seeing encouraging results from the application of new technology and work flows and where a continued focus on the well cost reduction is also improving performance.", "In Ecuador we continued to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project. And during the quarter we also signed a letter of intent for Group 1 of the mature field tender with contract signature and ramp up of operations expected in the second half of this year.", "In Mexico revenue fell sequentially and year-over-year due to lower overall rig count in the county, continued budget restrictions in Pemex and as several of our IPM rigs in the south were shutdown for the entire quarter due to local social issues that are outside of our control. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year is stronger as we continued to ramp up activity on the new mega tender contract where we have gained significant market share and as Pemex and the local government resolved the social issues impacting our IPM projects in the South.", "Middle East and Asia revenue increased 4% sequentially while margins grew by 161 basis points to 27.8%. The year-over-year revenues increased by 12% and margins were up by 323 basis points. In the Middle East sequential revenue growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia, where new well activity continues to expand supported by steady growth in the rig count and where rig less activity is also increasing in a number of fields. We continued to add resources and invest in additional infrastructure in the Kingdom to keep pace with the additional growth we are taking on and with the capacity and capabilities we now have on the ground our Saudi operations is quickly becoming one of the largest and most advanced setups in our global portfolio. Growth was also driven by the United Arab Emirates as activity continues to ramp up on our existing contracts together with additional seismic and completion technology deployments.", "In Southern Iraq activity was as expected down both sequentially and year-over-year as commercial discussions between the government and the international oil companies continue and where the situation was further complicated by mounting civil unrest during the quarter. The worsening security situation led us to take additional measures to protect our people and assets in the country, but beyond the additional costs and lower efficiency there has been no impact on our ongoing operational capabilities. However, safety remains our top priority and we continued to monitor the situation closely together with our security advisors and we are ready to take the appropriate actions should the situation worsen further. Activity in Northern Iraq on the other hand was strong in the second driven exploration drilling and we expect growth in this part of the country in the second half of the year to offset the activity drop we are seeing in the South.", "Turning to Asia we saw strong year-over-year growth in several geomarkets driven by higher customer activity as well as market share gains. The strongest growth was seen in Australia from continued land activity in Queensland, successful completion of the first isometric seismic survey in the Great Australian Bight and strong new technology sales for both wireline and drilling and measurements on exploration projects. In China revenue was up sequentially driven by strong offshore activity, seasonal recovery on land and our tight gas SPM project in the Ordos Basin for Yanchang Petroleum. Still year-over-year revenue was down in the second quarter due to slowdown in activity in several land basins as customers continue to review budgets and internal processes.", "Looking at the second half of the year, offshore activity looks strong and land activity including the shale gas developments is set to pickup from current levels. However, we expect growth rates to be somewhat tempered until our customers complete their internal reviews and spending plans are clarified.", "In Europe, C.I.S. and Africa, revenue grew 13% sequentially with margins improving by 180 basis points to 22.1% as activity rebounded from the first quarter seasonal lows. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew by 4% and margins were up by 158 basis points. Sequential revenue growth was driven by Russia, where we saw strong recovery in activity after a harsh winter. The underlying activity outlook both offshore and online in Russia continues to look solid and with recent contract awards in Sakhalin, we expect to finish the year on a strong note.", "Activity also increased strongly in the North Sea driven by seismic and core rig-related services in Norway for a number of customers. In Africa, sub-Saharan activity was solid in particular in Chad and Mozambique, while in North Africa activity rebounded sequentially with growth in both Algeria and Tunisia, but was partly offset by Libya, where activity remained subdued.", "In North America, our revenue grew 6% sequentially in spite of the Canadian spring breakup and 16% year-over-year as we continue to grow our market share online in hydraulic fracturing, artificial lift and drilling services. As we actively expand our land business, we are currently seeing some impact on our pre-tax operating margins, which were down 53 basis points sequentially and 170 basis points year-over-year driven by additional costs related to supply chain and transportation and on-boarding of several new companies. However, these effects should be short-lived as we continue to implement our strategic plan for our North America land business and in the process established a broad and unique platform for profitable technology-driven growth in the coming years.", "In our hydraulic fracturing business, we posted strong year-over-year revenue growth driven by market share gains, further improvements in operational efficiency as well as introduction of new technologies, which altogether more than offset the effects of the spring breakup in Canada. In terms of basic pressure pumping pricing, we saw some improvement in the second quarter, but this was contained to newer basins with lack of service capacity and to customers, where we still operate at very low margins. Still the pricing traction was partly offset by continued cost inflation for labor side and transportation and pricing discussions with our customers therefore continues to have a strong focus on cost recovery at this stage.", "In the second quarter, we also saw further improvement in our land drilling product lines, where the combination of new technology introductions, new business models and new alliances are driving both market share gains and higher operating margins. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater drilling activity was up sequentially due to the expected rebound from the operational delays that impacted the first quarter. In the second half of the year, the drilling rig count growth will flatten somewhat as some rig shift to completions related work although we still expect to see revenue growth through market share gains in several product lines.", "The highlight of the quarter was undoubtedly last month investor conference in New York, where we set out clear goals for continued strong growth and financial outperformance over the coming years. Our plans are built on the four key themes of technology, reliability, efficiency and integration, with technology and integration driving superior growth and reliability and efficiency improving financial performance. In terms of technology, we showed how our R&E transformation that started six years ago has led to a step change in operational performance of our products and how we continue to accelerate the pace of new technology introduction with flattening R&E investments.", "During the investor conference, we also laid out full details of our reliability and efficiency transformation programs and how this will change the way we manage our people, our assets and our inventory as we look to further improve our financial performance. Based on a set of realistic assumptions covering the global economy, the oil and gas markets and industry investment levels, we are confident in our ability to continue our run of financial outperformance and to deliver on the earnings per share, return on capital employed and free cash flow targets that we laid out during the conference.", "Turning our focus back to the remaining part of 2014, we continue to see a relatively constant mix of headwinds and tailwinds in the global economy and in our industry, which leads us to maintain our already established outlook for the year. The slow and steady recovery in the global economy is continuing and the global oil market remains relatively tight with a solid demand outlook, continued supply uncertainty related to geopolitics and with Brent prices holding steady above $100 per barrel, which should encourage oil directed investments in both the North American and international markets.", "The North America natural gas market appears more comfortably supplied as U.S. production continues to grow and storage levels gradually reconnect with historical averages, while the market balances in the international natural gas markets remain more or less unchanged. We continued to expect well related EMP investment levels to grow north of 6%, driven more by development and production focused activities while exploration spend will likely be flattish in 2014 driven by lower seismic spend at the IOC\u2019s focus on free cash flow generation.", "Within this scenario the growth and performance drivers that we outlined in late June amplified by our broad geographical footprint, our balanced technology portfolio and our agile organization will enable us to outperform in almost any market whether in North America or anywhere else in the world. We therefore remain positive and optimistic with respect to 2014 outlook as we continued aim for solid double-digit growth in earnings per share viewing this quarter\u2019s results as merely a steppingstone on the way to delivering the commitments we made in New York.", "Thank you. We will now open up for Q&A.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you, Paal. Greg we will now take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much. And Paal I wonder whether you could just shed a little bit more light about what your comments on the cost structure in North America, we are seeing very large volumes of sand for example, this can hardly carry the same margin as your technology offering, so how does this impact and how did it impact the margins in the quarter and how do you see that impacting margins in the quarter and how do you see that impacting margins in North America going forward when it comes to the relative pricing power and ability to take a markup on sand costs and logistics?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Thank you, Ole. So there is \u2013 as I said there is a lot of moving parts for us in North America at the moment. So maybe I can just take you through the picture the way I see it. So we have been focusing lately on revenue and expanding our revenue base in North America land. At $3.9 billion in the quarter, revenue was up 6% sequentially and 16% year-on-year which is a record for North America in spite of the Canadian breakup. Now the growth came from both efficiency and share, including pressure pumping, artificial lift and drilling services. In pressure pumping, we added one more fleet during the quarter and that takes the total of eight additional fleets in the past year, so we have clearly gained share in pressure pumping.", "So the key here is like I said expand the revenue and share base in North America land to further broaden our platform for technology driven growth in the coming years. Now with that we see some temporary impact on margins as we take on a higher proportion of somewhat lower margin businesses, but we plan to drive margins up in the coming quarters in these businesses through integration, scale and new technology introduction. And like you said as well, there were also some short-term additional costs related to supply-chain. For instance on sand where we took some higher costs because there were some significant changes in sand price and volume for several of our customers and also transportation had some higher costs due to the fact that we had a very high growth rate and transportation availability become quite tight. In addition to that you have the Canada breakup and you also have somewhat lower multi-client sales. So all in all, that drove the 53 basis points reduction, but our focus going forward again is to drive the margins back up, but on a much broader platform for revenue growth.", "Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks, Ole.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen", "Good morning. Paal, could you address the potential for sanctions impacting Schlumberger\u2019s business in Russia?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, as of now nothing has really changed for our position in Russia. Sanctions were implemented earlier in the year. There were some new sanctions coming out this year. So far, that has no real impact on our business. So, as of now it\u2019s business as usual for us. In Russia, so far this year, activity has been as planned or even slightly stronger. The only change from the plan we laid out in the \u2013 at the beginning of the year was the impact of the ruble, which had a fairly significant impact in Q1, but the ruble rebound somewhat in Q2. So, that\u2019s really only the main change from the plan that we have seen so far in Russia. So, as of now, no impact on sanctions and whether there will be impact in the future is a bit difficult to comment on, but as of now, we continue business as usual.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen", "Okay. And one follow-up Paal, could you talk just a little bit about the recent announcement of the deal with Precision Drilling and how quickly you think the U.S. can move to incentive pricing or some kind of integrated model? And I guess would this in that sense be shared with Precision or would this be \u2013 would Precision be working for you or are there a number of different scenarios as you look forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So, part of the reason for doing this alliance with Precision Drilling is that both ourselves and Precision Drilling believe that over time the North America land drilling market will move towards a general contractor model, towards more of a construction turnkey type of market. And in that setup, we have now established this alliance where Precision Drilling will be the general contractor and we will rent them our downhole technologies. In addition, we will train their people to run it. And obviously, we will own the equipment and we will maintain the equipment for Precision Drilling. So, we see this as an avenue to establish further penetration for our unique technologies in the North America land drilling market and hence it\u2019s another good growth opportunity for us.", "Jim Crandell - Cowen", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you. Next question? Please check the line.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just wanted you kind of expand a little bit about the cost pressures on your supply chain. I guess, my first question is are you able to pass through most of those costs right now you had said kind of near-term pressures, I am just wondering is that because you are expecting to get those pass-through or is it also partly because the kind of the way your transformation is setup, it just takes a little while to kind of absorb those and you start to see kind of better margins as we start to progress?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. David, I think in general, we are able to pass through those costs. What happened towards the end of Q1 and also into Q2, there were some significant changes in the way some of our customers operated in terms of sand prices, in terms of volumes and these were basically somewhat unannounced and something we have to respond to relatively quickly. We manage to continue to support our customers and support our operations, but we took some additional costs in order to do that. And over time, we are able to pass these on and lower than we manage to pass on towards the second part of this quarter, but there were some short-term changes that resulted in additional cost for us that we decided to absorb.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Alright. And then I guess my other question around that was on your logistics obviously we are very big logistics operations. As we start \u2013 as we see our North America progress over the next several years and in some of the cases we are seeing doubling of the amount of sand in wells, do you need to build that out more, are your sales I guess I am asking are you satisfied with the logistics footprint or is this an area where we need to build up a little bit better?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "This is all part of the entire story that I am talking about as well. We are gradually expanding that to make sure that we can meet changes to how our customers want to operate, but also continuous expansion of our business, right. So we continued to invest in that. And given the fact that we have grown so much over the past years, I mentioned eight traditional fleets in the past four quarters, we are at the point that now that we are upgrading some of this as well and that is resulting in some additional costs in this quarter.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you. Just a real quick question, Simon, could you just tell me where the share count was at the end of the quarter, if you don\u2019t mind?", "Simon Ayat", "Okay. Well, the average for the quarter was 1.315 billion, and this is a result of what we purchased during this quarter, which is 11.5 million shares. So your question about the end of the\u2026", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Yes, before the end of the quarter, just help me understand that?", "Simon Ayat", "I think towards the end of the quarter I have to confirm this figure for you will be about 1.38 billion.", "David Anderson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Simon Ayat", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita - UBS", "", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Simon Ayat", "Good morning.", "Angie Sedita \u2013 UBS", "", "So Paal, on the Analyst Day it certainly was clear that Schlumberger has decided that land rigs are important to furthering your technology and you just discussed the Precision deal, but you acquired earlier in the year the Saxon, 100% of Saxon, so can you talk about how that differs and the thoughts there in being able to integrate the rig with the bottom hole assembly and the timelines actually develop a newly designed rig and how many rigs that you actually put into the market over the next three years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if I first address the alliance with Precision versus the acquisition of Saxon, so Saxon is generally focused on the international market. And that\u2019s the mean that we are going to use to pursue the international well construction market. As of now, we have decided to pursue the North America well construction market, more through alliances, and that\u2019s where the Precision Drilling alliance comes into play. So in terms of our investment into new rig technologies, that is something we are just starting, so that\u2019s going to obviously take a little bit of time before we have something to put into the market. So I can\u2019t give you a specific number of how many rigs we will put in to the market, but that will be when the rig is ready. And we will then just gradually add capacity as we have viable work for these type of rigs going forward. So we have two different strategies, one is for North America through the Precision Drilling type of an alliance and through our own rigs in the international market.", "Angie Sedita - UBS", "That\u2019s quite fair enough. And then on China, you hit on it on your opening comments, but clearly things have changed here with the recent events, with the corruption of CNBC and a slowdown of PetroChina, so has that just changed your near-term outlook for China or your long-term outlook as well. And now do you believe it could be difficult for the independent Chinese oil service companies to succeed in the region?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I can\u2019t really comment on how it\u2019s going to be for the independent Chinese companies, but I would say that the main thing that is changing for us is the short-term. We are still very bullish on the medium to long-term growth prospects in China. We are very well setup in China to be part of that through our technology and integration capabilities. So as these processes continue and hopefully draw to a conclusion over the next couple of quarters, we see growth being tempered but beyond that I am very bullish on China going forward.", "Angie Sedita - UBS", "Okay. Thanks. I will turn it over.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "Thanks. Good morning guys. Paal if I could return to the Precision in North America strategy question a little bit and maybe ask you to address it within the context of the joint venture that you did last year with Forest in the Eagle Ford, my understanding of that venture was that it was really about establishing a business model in the U.S. of integrated services and control of project, can you contrast that versus what we are seeing now in the Precision arrangement which looks more like Schlumberger as a supplier or vendor to general contractor?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think these are two different things. So, within IPM, we have two different business models, one is well construction and one is production management. And the Forest deal we did is a production management type of deal where we are paid on a feet per barrel, while the alliance with Precision is more along the well construction lines, right. So, in some cases, we end up being the general contractor and we either own the rig or rent the rig and deploy our services through that or in the case with Precision Drilling, we will be renting them our downhole equipment while they are the general contractor. So, these are different permutations of the well construction model.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "Thank you for the clarification. That helps. Simon, if I could ask a quick one for you on Venezuela and the Bolivar exposure. Paal in his prepared comments talked about the good performance even on DSOs. Can you talk about what the currency impacts are there and what they might be here in the third quarter?", "Simon Ayat", "So, in the third quarter, we don\u2019t \u2013 I mean in the third quarter, our assumption that the exchange rate for the Bolivar will continue at the same rate that we are using today. And this is 6.3 Bolivar is to a dollar. Some of our revenues are in Bolivars and obviously the receivables, some of the outstanding receivables are also in Bolivars. If the exchange rate will change, will definitely impact us, I don\u2019t know to what extent the exchange rate will change. We know about the different exchange rates that are being used and we simulate our results on the various exchange rates, but for the time being, our Q3 assumption that there will be no change.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "No change, okay. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse", "Good morning guys. If we could shift to Latin America, Mexico first if I could, revenues were down. We all know what\u2019s kind of going on in Mexico, you have won some projects, you mentioned you had some rigs down in the IPM project in the south. Can you kind of walk us through the next 18 months of what you expect to see happen in Mexico?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "18 months is a long time, Jim. But let\u2019s start off with H2, so we see activity picking up in the second half of the year and that\u2019s going to be primarily in marine, but also in the north. We have had in addition to the mega-tender also several service contract wins in marine and in the south, which is going to give us further market share gains. So, this year is still impacted by the budget constraints of Pemex. So as we work through that, we still see growth in the second half of the year, but I believe most of these budget constraints as well as the rig shutdowns will be sorted out over the next one to two quarters. So, while I expect growth in the second half of the year, I am still a lot more optimistic about 2015 and hope that we can get back on track to have a really good year, next year in Mexico.", "Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse", "Through 2015 covers my 18 months, I appreciate that. Now, can you do the same thing for me for Brazil considering the drilling contractors now being re-tendered, do we expect that really to switch over at the end of the year? And what\u2019s the implication for your idle equipment in Brazil if that happens?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "First of all, we don\u2019t have any idle equipment in Brazil. We don\u2019t hold idle equipment around in various countries. If it is idle, we put it into the pool and put it to use. But in Brazil, this year is obviously significantly down both due to pricing and significantly lower activity. There might be some uptick in 2015, but I am not as optimistic on the improvement in 2015 in Brazil as I am in Mexico. I think we will see improvements in activity partly due to the drilling activity surrounding around 11 exploration awards, which is going to start for some of the IOCs in 2015. And there could also be a chance that Petrobras will increase some of their activity, but I am a bit more guarded on how great 2015 will be in Brazil until these two contracts that are now tendered, I expect them to be quite competitive to bid again, I don\u2019t think there is going to be any dramatic change to that now. We will see what happens.", "Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Becker from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. I want to circle back on North America, first quarter was impacted by weather, we saw second quarter impacted by some of the supply chain sand labor issues. Just any quantification in terms of what type of impact we have here that would be outside the norm?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I can\u2019t give you that like I reviewed in the \u2013 I think the first question from Ole, there is a lot of moving parts from our supply chain, has some impact, but there is a lot of other moving parts that I just reviewed. So, I can\u2019t break it down for you, but with all the moving parts, 53 basis points down isn\u2019t dramatic. And we are quite confident that we can improve margins going forward from this point.", "Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Sure. Maybe just order of impact between supply chain sand labor, just\u2026.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I am not going to break it down any further.", "Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just circling back on Latin America, just an update on the mobilization for the mega-tenders, is that on pace to be complete this year or do we actually maybe see some margin improvement in the fourth quarter as that winds down?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, we are on track with mobilization for that. So, a fair bit of the equipment that we needed for those contracts we already had in country. So, at this stage, we are operating 10 rigs across three projects for the mega-tenders. This was probably gradual increase in the second half of the year, but I don\u2019t expect any significant negative margin impact for the mobilization. So, we should see progress from this point.", "Doug Becker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Question with regard to international revenue outlook for the second half of the year, first half broadly speaking, we were up about 5% year-over-year, what do you think would be a reasonable expectation for second half on a year-over-year basis?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you correct for Framo, which was counted as revenue in H1 of last year and obviously now as the minority interest in OneSubsea this year, our international revenue was up 7% in H1.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Okay.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "And we expect that at least to continue in the second half of the year.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Okay. And a similar question, incremental margins were about 75% year-over-year, I mean, stunningly strong, I expect in the moderate for the second half of the year, but I guess the question is I know your target for 2017 on a consolidated basis is 40%, but it just seems to be that the execution is generating considerably stronger incrementals than frankly most seasoned observers have been expecting.", "Simon Ayat", "Well, was there a question or?", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "I guess the observation and the question is the sustainability, what we are seeing in the first half I mean I am modeling a considerable moderation and that\u2019s what the Street estimates convey and yet you continue to outperform markedly on that front?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Fair enough, so H1 like you said I think we are about 65% incremental. So I can give say \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that there might be some moderation in there in the second half of the year. Now we are working very hard on keeping these incrementals up and the strength of our position internationally should allow us to have higher incremental margin spend and obviously what we see in North America. Whether it\u2019s going to go down from the 65%, potentially it should, but we are going to do our best to keep it as high as possible.", "Bill Herbert - Simmons & Company", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on North Americas and outside of the supply chain side you mentioned on-boarding on some of the acquired companies, so if you can just talk about artificial lift business in aggregate I mean a dozen different companies in rod lift, I mean where are you in the continuing of kind of bringing everything to some sort of standardization or giving your manufacturing and operational efficiency where you want to be and what sort of timeline would you think that occurs on?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, it\u2019s a good question. So we are in the early phases of bringing everything together. So we are not looking to integrate each of these 12, 13 companies into one, one completely unified entity, they are working in different basins. They all have their individual setups. But we are looking to consolidate supply chain as much as possible and also take the best practices from the individual companies and try to populate them across all the different companies. So this is going to be done gradually and I still think it\u2019s going to take us probably a good 12 to 18 months to get everything setup exactly the way we want. But these companies are well run. It is a different business that what we have been in the past and we are also partly learning some of these things as we go into it. But I would say it probably will take us at least another 12 months to get this setup up exactly the way we wanted.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "And then you had referred on the last conference call to I mean you have to be in the game in order to change it from a technology standpoint, is there \u2013 how should we think about that timeline for introducing new technology in that business, that occurred \u2013 does that come post that 12 months period or should we look for some markers here interim?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Now what we are gradually doing now is to bring our ESP business closer together to these rod pump companies because we still believe that there is a period of utilization for different type of lift solutions throughout the life of the well. So by having a very good footprint when it comes to rod pump market share, it should be easier for us to penetrate this market in the early phase of the wells before you put the rod pump on the well with our ESP. So the first step in getting more technology into this is to increase the penetration of ESPs on that rod pump footprint.", "Jeff Tillery - Tudor, Pickering, Holt", "Thank you very much, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Paal maybe in some comments out of some major operators in the Norwegian area about maybe relooking at their capital spending what\u2019s your outlook for Norway for the second half and maybe more also in the \u201815 \u2013 into the \u201915?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you focus on H2, I mean for the summer months we expect a normal impact from the rig maintenance both in the UK and Norway. But as of now we have a solid activity outlook for the remaining part of the year in Norway. We have some good contract wins recently. There is some other work that is out for bid that will probably be awarded relatively soon. Some of these contracts are key for us. So we are hopeful that we will be successful in winning them. So I think overall, I am positive on the activity outlook for Norway for the second half of the year.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And then I am curious there are some important drilling going on, are there any discussions going on regarding anything follow-up beyond the first well right now or is it too early to have that till we see the results from the first well?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "You are talking about Russia?", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs", "Yes, that\u2019s right.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don\u2019t know the detail of the specific value you are referring to, but I am aware that there is good activity in the Arctic in the second half of this year. Going into 2015, I don\u2019t have any detailed visibility yet, but there is strong focus on advancing both these exploration and development programs in the Arctic in Russia and we are actively participating in that.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you very much. That\u2019s all I have.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brad Handler - Jefferies", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Brad Handler - Jefferies", "Couple of questions related to seismic please. Obviously, you have laid out your macro view and that\u2019s very helpful, but noted that multi-client sales in the second quarter were particularly soft, I guess, they haven\u2019t been this soft in a few years and I am curious if you can put that into some greater context for us and give us a sense of if that has implications for reviews on the fourth quarter, which is obviously where it\u2019s seasonally strongest generally? And then secondly just perhaps overall for the year, I think you signaled that you expect that seismic to be down for the industry, but I am not as clear if that\u2019s what you expect for yourselves as well or are some things like isometrics and other factors helping you out on a relative basis?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. If we start with multi-client like you said, multi-client revenue in Q2 was weak than we expected at $133 million. This is down 47% year-on-year, which is quite significant. It is not surprising that multi-client revenue falls when there is basically added scrutiny on exploration and seismic spend, but we are now at the lowest level that we have seen since 2009 just following the financial crisis, right, but we manage to absorb that reduction in the second quarter and still deliver on the quarter, which I am pleased with.", "In terms of the rest of the year, I expect Q3 to be fairly similar to Q2 I don\u2019t expect any significant improvement. There should be a year end effect. It might not be as high as what we saw in 2013, but I still expect there to be a surge towards toward year end, but potentially lower. In terms of the overall outlook for seismic for us, we also expected to be down in terms of overall revenue for this year and is driven then partly by multi-client and also through marine, where we at this stage have gone from 15 vessels at the beginning of the year, down to 13 vessels at the end of Q2. And we plan to reduce also down to 12 vessels in Q4. So, we are doing this to maintain profitability and utilization and we will continue to look at further vessels tax if it\u2019s necessary.", "Brad Handler - Jefferies", "Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Paal, I wanted to ask you just quickly on your offshore revenue growth outlook here, I mean clearly the offshore revenue component is very important for Schlumberger, just how are you seeing the unfold here versus maybe where you were at the beginning of the year given the fact that we have certainly seen some utilization challenges on the floater side as new capacity has come into the market and certainly you mentioned again the demand waning here on the IOC side. Has there been any material changes as you think about revenue growth here for you, what should the market externally look at, I mean because clearly we see the utilization numbers and we are able to track that, we know day rates have come down significantly. We know you have got share opportunities here that you are gaining, I mean, how do we think about the offshore revenue stream for Schlumberger?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at the international market, so far this year we have seen about 6% growth in rig count on land as well as 6% growth in rig count for the conventional offshore. Deepwater is basically two stories. You have Brazil, which is down about 27% year-to-date, while the rest of the world is also up about 6%, which is similar to the conventionally offshore. So, there is really no change to what we expected going into the year. We had factored into our deepwater plans, some lower utilizations as we were expecting these commercial discussions on rig rates to lead to lower utilization. Some of these discussions have concluded actually quicker than what we thought. Then I think that has the positive impact on the utilization versus what we assumed, but really nothing dramatic. We expected Brazil to be down significantly and the rest of offshore to continue to grow at the solid pace and 6% is we consider that quite good.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Okay. So the rate of growth really nothing has changed.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes.", "Bill Sanchez - Howard Weil", "Okay. I appreciate the time. I will turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "Yes. Just a quick follow-up. Simon, can you give us a breakdown of how much of the 16% growth year-on-year North America was organic versus the acquired companies?", "Simon Ayat", "Well, Michael, we obviously have these numbers, but we are not going to disclose all of these details.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim", "Okay, thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie from IBERIA Capital. Please go ahead.", "Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital", "Hey, guys. I guess I got a little bit of a different question for you on the lift business than what you had so far. My question is centered around your view of where that business develops over time, because clearly obviously buying rod lift companies and the dumb iron if you will associated with that is not something that is \u2013 something Schlumberger has typically been interested in the past? Is there another angle here we should be looking at namely perhaps making it more of a service delivery business through the life of the field versus just a pure equipment sale business? What\u2019s your vision for where that segment goes?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It\u2019s a very good question. So I think there are two things to be said about that. Firstly, I think over time there are things that could be done to advance the technology that is used. Now, I think you will be needing a range of technologies, because the flow rates of these wells, they vary gradually with time. So \u2013 but I think there are things that could be done both on the ESP side and on the PCP rod lift side, which we are working on. So, that\u2019s on the technology itself. But the other part is the business model like you allude to. And our view of this for the future would be that we potentially ultimately can sell lift. So, we will take on the well and we will basically have a business model, where we are paid on production for off time and our ability to maximize production through the optimal lift solution for the well. So, that is our view on the future. That\u2019s why we are getting into this. And again changing, changing the game will have to be done from within. Rod pumps are going to be key in this based on the installed base in North America land, but I think there is opportunity to optimize the technology and there is also a very good opportunity to potentially change the business model over time. ", "Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital", "Great. How would you help us thinking about how that trajectory looks, how long it takes, pace of adoption and so on an so forth?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, it\u2019s a bit difficult to predict on that, Rob. What we are focusing on now is to basically consolidate all these companies that we have both, gain a further understanding of the market and get closer to this part of our customer base, which we haven\u2019t worked on \u2013 worked with closely in the past. And I think as we do that and establish ourselves as a credible player in this market, which I think we can do relatively quickly, I think our chances of starting to change this business model say over the next one to two years should be there.", "Rob MacKenzie - IBERIA Capital", "Great, thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. Now, on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today\u2019s call. Greg, will you now please provide the closing comments?", "Unidentified Company Speaker", "Thank you.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you, Greg. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full quarter 2014 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston where the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting took place yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information is included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your comments after the prepared segments.", "I will now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $1.50. This represents an increase of $0.01 sequentially and is $0.15 higher when compared to the same quarter last year. During the quarter we recorded $1.8 billion of pretax charges. These charges are primarily related to actions we have taken to meet the challenges of the current market conditions.", "The $806 million of charges relating to the restructuring of the WesternGeco seismic fleet are as we announced last month. We recorded $296 million of severance cost associated with the headcount reduction of approximately 9,000. This reduction which will largely be completed by the end of the first quarter will bring our headcount more in line with the currently anticipated activity levels.", "In Venezuela effective December 31, 2014, we changed the exchange rate we applied to our bolivar denominated transactions from 6.3 to 50 bolivar per dollar, which is in line with the SICAD II exchange rate resulting in a $472 million charge.", "We believe that this rate now best represents the economics of our business activity in Venezuela. Going forward, this charge will reduce the US dollar amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses. Had we applied this exchange rate throughout all of 2014, it would have reduced our full year EPS by approximately $0.08.", "The last item relates to $199 million write-down of unconventional integrated project in the Eagle Ford as the result of the decline in oil prices.", "Fourth quarter revenue of $12.6 billion was flat sequentially. This reflected approximately $260 million of yearend software product and multi-client sales which were weaker than what we typically experienced in the fourth quarter.", "Pretax operating income of $2.8 billion decreased 1% sequentially while the pretax operating margins decreased by just 19 basis points to 22%. This level of margin is consistent with the same period last year.", "Sequential revenue and pretax margin highlights by product group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins increased by 95 basis points to 30.9%. The revenue decrease was largely attributable to the seasonal drop in marine seismic activity while wireline experienced declines in Russia due to the seasonality and the weakening of the ruble. These decreases were partially offset by yearend multi-client and software sales. The margin increase reflected a more favorable revenue mix as a result of the yearend sales. ", "Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.7 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined by 94 basis points to 20.7%. These decreases were primarily driven by unfavorable currency effects and activities declines in Russia that impacted the drilling and measurement and M-I SWACO as well as lower IPM activity in Mexico.", "Fourth quarter Production Group revenue of just under $5 billion increased 5% sequentially on higher well services activity in both Western Canada and US land. Year end sales of Completions and Artificial Lift Products also contributed to the increase. Pretax margins were essentially flat at 18.3%.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 21.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 22.1% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion representing an improvement of $458 million as compared to the end of Q3.", "We spent $1.1 billion on our stock buyback program during Q4. This represented 12.1 million shares at an average price of $90.22. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $1.2 billion of CapEx and an improvement in working capital of almost $1 billion.", "From a cash flow perspective we generated $11.2 billion of cash flow from operations during all of 2014. During this same period we generated a free cash flow of $6.2 billion. This represents $700 million increase over 2013 and means that we converted 84% of our 2014 earnings excluding charges and credits into free cash flow.", "This strong cash generation has allowed us to continue to invest in growth opportunities which we did by completing various acquisitions and investing $4 billion in CapEx, $1.1 billion in multiclients and SPM projects while at the same time returning $6.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.", "During the full year 2014, we repurchased 47.5 million shares at an average price of $98.38 for a total of $4.7 billion while paying out almost $2 billion in dividends.", "Yesterday our board of directors approved a 25% increase in our annual dividend to $2 per share. This is now the fifth consecutive year that we have increased our dividend and it results in doubling over the five-year period.", "This new level of dividend reflects our confidence and our ability to continue to generate superior cash flows and return excess cash to our shareholders even in the face of market challenges. As it relates to 2015, our strong balance sheet will continue -- will also allow us to be opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of market conditions to make strategic acquisitions and investment.", "CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM investment is expected to be approximately $3 billion in 2015. We expect the ETR for the full year 2015 to be in the low to mid 20s. However this can rally on a quarterly basis depending on the geographical mix of earnings.", "And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter we continued our strong financial performance driven by record activity in North America and in the Middle East and Asia. In other international areas, Latin America revenues improved slightly on higher activity in Venezuela and Columbia while Europe, CIS and Africa fell as the ruble weakened and the seasonal decline activity started in Russia.", "Europe, CIS and Africa declined further from the downward trend in oil prices which curtailed customer activity and reduced rig count in the North Sea and parts of West Africa.", "Overall fourth quarter revenue was flat with the previous quarter but grew 6% year-on-year. Pretax operating income decreased 1% sequentially and grew 7% year-on-year while pretax operating margins were essentially flat slipping 19 basis points sequentially but rising 13 basis points year-on-year.", "This performance ended the year in which Schlumberger revenue climbed to a new high in spite of significant head winds including activity challenges in a number of geo markets, geopolitical unrest in Libya and Iraq, international sanctions in Russia and reducing customer spend.", "Still our global footprint, broad business portfolio, and strong execution capabilities provided the required resilience to outperform even in this environment.", "Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $3.4 billion in free cash flow in the fourth quarter bringing the full year total to more than $6.2 billion. This represents an increase of 13% over 2013 and a conversion of 84% of the full year's earnings into free cash flow.", "During the quarter we continued our active stock buyback program buying back $1.1 billion in stock to keep us on track to complete the $10 billion program within the stated two and a half year period. ", "As a further demonstration of the confidence we have in our continuing ability to generate free cash flow, the board of directors just approved that 25 increase in our quarterly dividend which means that we have doubled our dividend payment over the past five years.", "By geography, our North American results set the new record for the area as revenue grew 2% sequentially. Line activity improved in spite of tough sequential recount as new technology introductions and operational efficiencies drove performance.", "___ drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico returned to normal, and grew by 12% sequentially following the impact of loop currents in the third quarter. While multiclient seismic sales also improved although ending up significantly down compared to the same quarter last year.", "Sequential revenue gains were led by the production group on higher pressure pumping activity on land in both the US and Canada and further supported by very strong uptake of the BroadBand family of stimulation technologies that are growing at four times the rate of highway at the same stage of it's introduction.", "North America margins increased by a further 24 basis points in Q4 to reach 19.6% driven by stronger activity and new technology uptake, solid execution and further supply chain cost improvements.", "Lower oil prices have already created pricing pressure on land for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services and we are actively working with our customers in all basins to help lower their overall drilling and completion costs.", "In addition to general typing discussions, our customer interactions are focused on how we can better work together and how we can create savings from new technologies and workflows as well as from improved operational planning and efficiency.", "Looking forward in North America we see a relatively flat first quarter for offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico as well as solid activity in Canada. However the dramatic fallen oil prices has already led to a reduction of around 400 rigs in US land compared to the October peak and we expect the trend of activity reductions and pricing pressure to continue in the first quarter.", "In our international business, strength in the Middle East and Asia and solid performance in Latin America was offset by significant revenue reductions in Europe, CIS and Africa. As a result, revenue slipped 1% sequentially but improved 1% year-on-year while pretax operating income decreased 2% sequentially but grew 4% year-on-year.", "Full year performance in the international market was strong in spite of E&P CapEx spend remaining flat with 2013. Year-on-year revenue grew by 4%, operating income by 12% with incremental margins of 69%. ", "International margins which ended the year at 24% grew 168 basis points versus 2013 and we generated more than 70% of our global operating income in the international market in the past year.", "The significant drop in oil prices have put pressure on our customers to further reduce their cost of barrel and we are actively engaged with most of them to find ways to generate their required cost savings while maintaining a very strong focus on the quality and integrity on the products and services we provide.", "Within the international areas, performance was led by the Middle East and Asia where sequential revenue grew by 4% and pretax operating margins increased by 71 basis points to 28.3% driven by activity growth in the Middle East while activity in Asia was largely unchanged.", "Year-on-year revenue increased 6% and margins grew by 2013 basis points. In the Middle East region, activity reached a new record in Saudi Arabia led by growth from a number of key projects and we expect to see continued strong levels of both rig-related and rig-less activity in the coming years.", "Kuwait was also strong on land seismic activity and yearend product and software sales while Oman continued to be driven by wireline services and hydraulic fracturing work. Activity was again higher in the United Arab Emirates particularly for well construction technologies both offshore and on the island drilling project.", "In Iraq, activity was steady in the north as an improved security environment had allowed operations to slowly resume. However the overall activity level still remained significantly below pre-conflict levels. In the south, we saw modest activity improvements although new project start-ups continued to be delayed.", "Southeast Asia remained flat through the third quarter as strength in shale gas development on land in china offset modest activity declines in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam.", "China was also boosted by increased product sales during the fourth quarter and strong offshore activity in Bohai Bay. In Malaysia, work has begun in the new well construction project on the Bokor field where we have now been conducting integrated project and production management operations for more than 10 years.", "This is another example of the value that long-term relationships bring to integrated operations.", "In Latin America, revenue improved 1% sequentially while pretax operating margins fell 102 basis points to 20.9% as growth in Columbia and Venezuela was offset by weakness in Mexico and delayed in Argentina and Brazil. Year-on-year revenue grew by 3% while pretax operating margin slipped by 31 basis points. In Venezuela growth was driven by new technology and work flow deployment for PDVSA as well as increased activity in the far half through a series on new project startups.", "In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget constraints and seasonal weather effect impacting offshore activity. The lower customer spent mainly impacted land development activity although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in the area activity in Brazil was solid on land but offshore work was lower and IOC projects were completed and drilling delays were experienced on existing project. In Argentina growth slowed in the fourth quarter although activity from conventional resources grew and the highway technology continuing to penetrate the market.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue fell by 7% sequentially with margin declining by 112 basis points to 22.3%. Compared to the same quarter last year, Europe, CIS and Africa revenue fell by 5% while margin slipped by 21 basis points. In Russia, weakness in the ruble and the onset of winter weather led to the lower result.", "The North Sea activity also declined on lower rig count in both Norway and the UK as customers reduced activity in response to lower oil prices. In other parts of Europe, Africa and CIS area, activity was stronger in North Africa with increasing activity for unconventional resources in Algeria and Tunisia. This was partially offset by very weak activity in Libya where we now have successfully restructured our operations in line with the lower activity.", "In Angola, activity decreased following the peak in explorations seen in the third quarter while elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa activity was strong in Congo and we also secured additional growth in Chad and Gabon. Before leaving the Europe, CIS and Africa area, I would also like to mention that we were awarded a full-year contract for drilling and well services by Statoil for the UK Mariner development east of Shetland. Mariner is one of the largest project development on the UK continental shelf in the last 10 years and their 22 distinct services that Schlumberger will provide offer considerable opportunities for integration in this unique project.", "In terms of the outlook for the international market, as part of the Middle East and partial Latin America, we do expect a reduction in spend levels for all customer groups in the coming year although we believe that the activity and pricing impact will be less than what is projected in North America land. It is also worthwhile to keep in mind that E&P spend in the international market was already flat in 2014 with a corresponding drop in discovered reserves and in oil production capacity. So a further reduction in spend levels in 2015 will likely accelerate these trends.", "Turning to the overall macro outlook for 2015, GDP growth rate softened somewhat in the fourth quarter but that 3% growth is still projected to be higher than 2014 confirming that the global recovery remains intact and as a result, demand for oil is again expected to increase by around 1 million barrels per day in 2016.", "Looking at the supply side, the growth in global oil production capacity of around 1 million barrels per day over the past year matches the growth in demand. So the overall oil market is still relatively well balanced from a capacity standpoint.", "The dramatic fall in oil prices is instead a result of higher marketed supply in the second half of 2014 from North America and also from OPEC who have shifted focus from protecting oil prices to protecting oil prices to protecting market share. In response to the falling oil prices, the industry is currently in the process of significantly reducing E&P investments which will lead to a reduction in supply as declining rates impact current production capacity and lower exploration and development activity delay supply additions.", "In a scenario of continuing economic growth and increasing demand for oil, the lower E&P investment levels will lead to a tightening of the oil market with the first indication being the reduced production capacity in the international markets in 2014 following a year of flat E&P investment. In this uncertain environment, we continue to focus on what we can control and we have already taken significant steps to restructure and right size our business to match the reduced E&P investment level.", "We are further convinced that performance must now be driven by and accelerated change in the way we work through our transformation program. The delivery of new technology that improves the performance of our customer's reservoirs, the increases in efficiency and reliability that reduced overall timing, development and production costs and the opportunities for growth and greater integration bring are all significant drivers of our own and our customers' performance.", "The technical performance targets of our transformation program is independent of the macro environment and we are in 2015 actually looking to further accelerate the implementation of the program. In terms of technology, we still expect new technology sales at premium pricing to contribute more than 25% of our revenue while we also target integration related activity where we had unique capabilities to exceed 30% of our total activity.", "In terms of reliability and efficiency we are in 2015 aiming to make further progress towards our targets of a 10-fold reduction in non-productive time and doubling in asset utilization at 20% increase in workforce productivity and 10% lowering of support costs which will all help to significantly lower our operating costs.", "Part of our transformation program requires us to work differently with our customers in order to fully realize the value for both them and for us. Given the current business environment, we have engaged with many of them in recent months to drive forward these changes with very positive response.", "Still given the level of the oil price and the industry wide focus on reducing E&P investments, we clearly have a challenging year in front of us. In this environment we have our entire organization fully focused on continuously engage in our customers to understand any changes to their plan, retailer resources through activity in line with the targets and playbooks we have established and to manage commercial discussions according to the priorities we have put in place for each of the over 80 countries where we operate.", "Beyond our strong execution focus, we also see the coming year as flushed with opportunities for us which we intend to fully capitalize on as we look to further strengthen the company going forward. With our wide geographical footprint, extensive business portfolio, and clear financial strength, we remain confident in our ability to outperform in any part of the cycle including the current market condition.", "Thank you. We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer", "Yes, thanks a lot and thanks for your insights there Paal. I wondered whether you could start with the macro here. I wondered whether you could help us understand your slight change in language from the third quarter. You highlighted both in the third quarter release and the fourth quarter release that negativity, the peer revisions, I mean, that's consistent. But on the supply side you talked in the third quarter about pipe capacity and now you are talking about increase in supply. I just wondered whether you could just elaborate a little bit and help us understand the difference in the magnitude.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. So if you look at the high level macro view that we have, nothing has really changed from what we said on the Q3 call. So looking at GDP at 3% we are still looking at solid growth overall in 2015 and oil demand is also going to be up. So as we said in Q3 the issue is really on the supply side where I think it's very important that we separate the three in global production capacity and marketed supply. So if you look at the global production capacity in 2014, it grew by about 1 million barrels a day which is equal to the growth in demand. So the significant drop in oil prices is not driven by this over capacity but rather by the higher marketed supply which is coming from North America and from OPEC.", "So we believe that the supply side is currently going through a significant change where the key local producers have shifted focus from protecting price to now protect market share, and the consequence of this is that at least for a period of time, this is going to make the high cost producers become the new swing producers where the activity is going to be even more driven by the variations in oil price and the economics of their project. And the tool used to drive this change to the supply side is the lower oil price which is what we are seeing now.", "So the main new element from the Q3 call is that OPEC decided not to cut production so the reduction in the marketed supply will have to come from lower E&P investments and that is really the only offtake to our macro view.", "Ole Slorer", "And my second follow up would be exactly on that. You highlight this time around in your release that the two effect of lower CapEx increased declined curves from existing fields and delays in new field start-ups. So I wonder whether you could talk a little bit at a high level at what point do you see the impact of this will change market psychology on the direction of incremental capacity versus a direction of incremental demand assuming demand plays out in line with your view there.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, if we assume that oil demand is going to be up by 1 million barrels, if we don't take lower investments and already reduce their capacity, the market is already heading towards a tightening. I think that's very clear. Now we don't expect the oil prices to improve significantly until there are signs of weakening supply, and the weakening supply will either first come from North America or from international. I think the signs we need to look at are different from the two regions. Given the strong growth momentum in North America I think what the market will be looking for here is the slowing year-over-year growth while given the flat investment levels in international market in 2014, capacity already reduced in 2014. So here I think we are looking for a further reduction in absolute supply. So I think these are the two main signals to look for.", "Ole Slorer", "And then your guess again on timing?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I am not going to guess at least not in public.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay, Paal, I will hand it back. Thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson", "Good morning Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "David Anderson", "I was just wondering, in light on your commentary around the supply response and you are talking about international and North America, there is clearly a pretty healthy debate out there about the economics of North America in unconventional. Just wondering with Schlumberger's expertise in reservoir, can you help us understand how you think about that marginal cost supplier and in particular how you see the trajectory of spending and activity levels in North America over the next several quarters?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I think if you look at 2015 activity in North America and you look at the third party spend surveys, it indicates about 25%, 30% reduction. So it's clearly going to be a tough year going forward, right. As to the viability of the project I think there is still a broad range of operating costs in North America land. But I would say that as a general statement the shift in OPEC from protecting price to protecting share is raising some questions around the US shale going forward and I think the new oil price dynamic is clearly going to test the resilience of several North America land producers from their ability to get financing, their ability to continue to drive cost efficiency and reduced cost of barrel and also their ability to maintain production at current level. So I think most likely we are going to face the situation in North America land with lower activity, more focus on the lower cost production areas for a while. That's our view at this stage.", "David Anderson", "And then just kind of sticking still on North America in light of the headcount and CapEx reduction and keeping in mind that you are getting more capital efficient of the transformation. I just wonder if you could help us understand your strategy during this downturn to align your capacity with activity levels. Should we expect a similar strategy that Schlumberger employed in 2009 or can we expect it to be a little bit more focused on utilization this time around?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I am not going to go into the detail tactics and strategy we have on pricing and share. That's going to vary all depending on I would say the basin, the customer type and so forth. But I will say that the general rule that we have applied in recent years that below a certain contribution margin, we will rather stack the equipment than operate at the level that is unacceptable.", "David Anderson", "Okay, thank you Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert", "Thank you, good morning. Paal, so switching gears here a sec from North America to the international realm and recognizing that the early data internationally has not been as transparent as it has in North America given the litany of capital spending analysis for '15. But given where oil prices are today, certainly it seems that the indication points to a pretty hard landing in the international realm and while we share your view that the contraction internationally is going to be more benign than in North America, it's still going to be fairly consequential. So just as a starting point, is down 10% to 15% internationally within the realm of reason where we sit today?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "While to think to kind of venture out and even make full year statement at this stage I think it's too early. We have very significant lack of visibility. The way we are going about managing actually both North America and internationally, is we are looking quarter by quarter now. So we have taken actions to be in line with costs versus the activity that we foresee for Q1. And we will continue to stay very closely in touch with customers to look at plans going forward to make sure that we continue to tailor resources to the projected activity.", "Now we are aware of the third party surveys and the 10% to 15% reduction in international spend for 2015 I think today is probably a reasonable starting point although I wouldn't confirm it from our side for the full year.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay. And then secondly kind of juxtaposing downturn as it were 2015 versus what prevailed in 2009, I mean clearly you are a different company coming into this downturn than you were in 2009 given the internal transformation focus. In light of that, do you think the decremental margins this time around are going to be better behaved anywhere in 2009 or basically about in line?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I would be very disappointed if we don't see a significant improvement in our decremental margins in this downturn versus what we saw in 2009. The -- we've had a very, very strong focus on generating incremental margins in the past four, five years, and over the past quarter we have basically converted our strong and peer expectations on incremental into equally clear expectations internally on what good decrementals are. I am not going to give you what the number is but like I said I will be very disappointed if we don't do significantly better than in 2009.", "Bill Herbert", "Very good, thank you sir.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte", "Thanks. Good morning Paal. I am trying to hone in on how you're actually approaching 2015 and maybe take it from the perspective of the methods to the leadership of Schlumberger in terms of controlled business. You mentioned several things you can control, maintain the targets on the transformation program with the lack of visibility, maybe tighten up the reaction time from six months reviews to quarter-by-quarter. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about in terms of approaching the downturn of '15?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I think you hit on several of the things. But if I was to just kind of repeat to clarify them, what we have passed to our senior management team in the quite frequent meetings we've had over the past quarter, there are really three high level things. Firstly, the increased importance of staying very, very close to our customers. First interactively support our efforts to reduce their cost levels but also to make sure that the -- we very clearly understand their plans and changes to their plans. That's the first one. The second one is what you will alluded to do that we stay focused on what we control. And that is to proactively adjust costs to activity levels, and factoring in the benefits from the transformation. And also having a clear plan on how we are going to navigate the commercial landscape in terms of activity and pricing discussions with our customers but also very importantly to continue to focus and deliver safe and high quality operations, which is essential to our performance but also to our customer's performance.", "And the third one which we are also balancing into the total picture is to capture the opportunities that we see in the current environment and we see the current environment as being flushed with opportunities for us. First is to gain market share in light of our two main competitors looking to combine. Secondly to accelerate the transformation, our organization is now pulling very hard on it and we also see our customers being very open to adjust how we work with them and how we interact with them to gain some of the benefits. And then the third one is inorganic growth. We see lots of opportunities for this based on our strong cash flow and also very solid balance sheet.", "So these are the high level messages that we have already passed to our management team and they are currently executing.", "Michael LaMotte", "That's very helpful. Thank you. If I can follow-up on your inorganic growth comment quickly, does the current environment change the process around acquisitions and the last few years they've been smaller, bolt-on has been used as a term to describe the strategy since Smith. Does the appetite for a larger deal change in this environment?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, I wouldn't see that. The current environment has changed the strategic directions that we were looking to pursue. It is more about when these opportunities arise. We have a clear view of where the company is heading and what we want to do from an M&A standpoint. We have been executing a number of these things in pervious years and as we go forward now, we would look at whether the other opportunities that we have in our list become accelerated opportunities in which case we will pursue them.", "Michael LaMotte", "Okay, thanks so much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks. Good morning guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Morning.", "Angie Sedita", "Paal, so could you talk a little bit, I mean you have the 25% reduction in your CapEx and could you give us a little bit of high level color on that cut where the cuts are coming from and I recall that in 2009, you did reduce your CapEx tied to technology but based on your opening remarks, it sounds that that would not be case to cycle and then also how flexible are you on your CapEx outlook for 2015?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Well like you say in the current full year CapEx estimate is 3 billion, but given the lack of visibility and the uncertainty, this is still subject to change. So I will also that part of the CapEx reduction is due to the efficiency gains that we are planning from the transformation. So you cannot directly translate the CapEx to a projected revenue for 2015 and I also don't think you can directly compare it to the CapEx reductions that we did in 2009.", "I will also say that we have significant flexibility built into our manufacturing capabilities. We are, as I mentioned, targeting market share gains in particular in the international market. So if we need more CapEx, to serve these gains, we have the flexibility to increase CapEx during the year, and also we have the opportunity and flexibility to decrease CapEx further if the impact on the transformation is even beyond what we are targeting. ", "Angie Sedita", "All right. And then kind of an unrelated follow-up, I mean obviously your customers are coming to you and the international markets talking and looking at the contracts and where you can pull out cost out of the system, and you are seeing it in the US, how much success or have you begun conversations and where you can pull cost out of the system specifically in US frac. Is there other cost recovery opportunities besides proppants, truck, rail and what are you seeing along those lines?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well overall or in the US?", "Angie Sedita", "Both, actually.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "While I would -- our approach to these discussions with our customers and we are receiving invitations to engage in these discussions both international and in North America. I mean our approach is that we fully understand the need our customers have to reduce their overall costs. And we have engaged in a range of discussions where we are looking at volume discounts versus market share, further application and new technology, generally better planning and efficiency maybe less use of backup resources, better terms and conditions and it also involves general pricing discussions, right. So with the transformation, we have significant opportunity to drive costs of our system internally but some of these cost savings will also depend on our customers being open to work with us in different ways. And I would say there is a significant increase in that openness to start to realize these values and I think our discussions in general are focused on how we can create more value together, obviously in addition to general pricing discussions.", "Angie Sedita", "All right. And so -- I guess to add on to that, are you going back to your supply chain vendors for changes in cost reductions and proppants and other sources that you have in the US or internationally and are you able to pull cost out of your system besides the efficiency side?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, absolutely. And over the past three years or so, we have fully centralized our shared services and supply chain organization including global category management. So we are fully leveraging firstly our buying power and secondly I would say a highly capable supply chain organization to drive a similar type of discussion with our suppliers as to the discussions we have with our customers.", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks. I will turn it over.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "James West", "Hey, good morning Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "James West", "I wanted to just touch on the transformation program again and kind of clarify a few things there. Obviously you are looking to speed up the transformation. I wanted to know if you could give us some sense of kind of how much more quickly you can go through this? And then secondarily, does the downturn, which I know we all don't like, nobody likes downturns, but does that not make the transformation easier to be in a downturn?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "In some ways it does. Because then you are performing quite well and you are busy taking on more work and growing to change to where you were both internally and in the interfaces, you have both the customers and suppliers. It's more difficult to drive change in that type of situation. When you have a shift in market conditions as you have now, we see even more interest internally and even more openness on the customer supply side to engage in doing things differently. So I would say, yes, the changing market condition provides us with more opportunity to accelerate so then the key is just how do we put resources on to this from a central management standpoint to have the various parts of the program staff and given the financial means to accelerate some of the investments that we are making to realize these gains.", "James West", "Okay. Great. And then I have a follow-up not on that but unrelated. You made a comment earlier about going after market share as a result of your two major competitors combining. Have you already seen customers come to you and have you already seen market share gains? I know it is early days but is it already happening?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No I think it's a bit premature to say it's happening now. I mean the transaction is not closed yet. So I think as of now we are preparing for this. In discussions with our customers, the topic comes up, but I would say that this is more something that will take place if and when the transaction is closed.", "James West", "Okay. Got it. Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "Hey, good morning Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Kurt Hallead", "Just follow-up on James's question on the potential fallout from the merger. As you indicated there is nothing yet shaking loose necessarily and that will come post deal close. So you've indicated or you've emphasized at least in your prior commentary market share gains and with an emphasis on the international side. So I was wondering if you might be able to just give us a little bit of color on what you think may shake loose and how many basis points of market share gains could come out of this if not for Schlumberger specific, maybe on a broader basis?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well if I was going to comment on the transaction firstly at the high level, I would say that the pending transaction first validates what we have been saying all along and that is that scale is essential to drive performance in the business that we are in. Now from our experience making a making a large transaction to build and leverage scale it has a series of challenges. And in general everything takes much longer than you initially think. And in addition to this, all the extra work that is involved with making such a transaction, easily distracts you from running the base business. So as I have been saying we look at this transaction as an opportunity within capital low for us and we do intend to capitalize on it, and this is again linked to the gaining of market share. In the international market I would say in many countries our market share has been limited by a glass ceiling and this glass ceiling has been put in place by our customers to make sure that there is enough work to make a third player viable. Now if the other two players were to combine into one, then I think this glass ceiling can easily be broken and that's why we are basically going through pretty much all our contracts in all the international countries we operate in and to make sure we have targeted plans for how we would look to capitalize on this market share opportunity if and when the transaction closes.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay. That's good. And so many topics and so little time, so just wanted to try to calibrate some things with you. You said you guys reduced headcount by 9,000 to address current activity levels, then you reference a couple of third-party E&P surveys with the US down 25% to 30% which seems low in my view and 10% to 15%, which if I were to interpret your commentary though you didn't state specifically might suggest is you think that 10% to 15% reduction in international spend is too low, or too much? ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "While as I said I didn't make a full year statement on this. We are going to focus on managing this year in quarters. I think the general statements I would make is that the impact on North America Land we expect to be significantly more dramatic then what you would see in the rest of the world.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay. And then if I just may finish with one. Just curious about your views on what's going on with the market opportunities in Brazil given all the corruption, scandals and so on and so forth. And maybe tying that back to the merger coming up here, which would give your competitor about 70% market share, if I'm not mistaken, of the recently awarded drilling package. So first and foremost, with the mess in Brazil, is that going to lead to activity declines you think in 2015? And then secondarily, how do you see the possibility of this drilling contract being re-bid one more time?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I think as to your -- the things going on but in Petrobras I will let Petrobras comment on those things. Our relationship with Petrobras and our working relationship continues to be very good. Now Petrobras did recently announce budget cuts for their first half of 2015 and versus a previously indication of flat spend. So there will be challenges in Brazil going into this year. As for the new contracts, the latest information we have is that the wireline and E&M contract will kick in mid-year of 2015. And what is going to happen to the market share within these contracts and I don't know. We are based on the bid happy with the contact. Now what Petrobras chooses to do in terms of market allocations we will have to revert to them.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay. I really appreciate it. Thanks a lot, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Bill Sanchez", "Thanks, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Bill Sanchez", "Paal, given your quarter-to-quarter kind of look here how you are managing the business I was hoping perhaps you could help us just calibrate 1Q relative to fourth quarter? I know we didn't see quite probably the yearend product sales one would expect. You talked in your prepared comments just kind of some of the puts and takes in North America but I didn't hear much specifically around international. And just trying to see if you can help us calibrate how we should think about 4Q to 1Q here from an EPS perspective?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay, if you look at the first quarter, even for the first quarter there is still significant visibility challenges. Now we do expect a significant sequential drop in revenue due to, like you say, last year on product sales, the normal seasonal impact in particular in North Sea, Russia, China as well as in Marine Seismic and also the exchange rate impact in particular from Venezuela and Russia is going to felt. And the last part which is kind of new this year is further activity and pricing impact from the reduced E&P CapEx spend. So what we have done is and we have tailored our cost space for revenues to be around the levels for the first quarter of last year. So this involves a range of cost measures taken in Q4 including the release of the 9,000 people that we quoted. So I would say I am comfortable with our cost structure with respect to this base case of Q1 activity around revenue levels of Q1 of last year. Now this activity is stronger, we have means to cover it, and if it is lower we have the ability to quickly cut more.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. So 1Q revenue '15 equal to 1Q revenue '14 overall?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I am not saying that the revenue is going to be that, I am saying that that's how we have tailored our cost base.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. So if I just get back then to the headcount reductions then, so the reductions you have made, I guess, first, assume that this -- it seems like from the call this is strictly a North America reduction, is that in fact the case of the headcount cuts you have made so far?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, it's not. This is a global reduction and it both a combination of I would say structure headcount as well as fee capacity headcount.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. So there's still room here as your quarter-to-quarter view changes for further headcount reductions on a global basis? I guess is that a fair comment, Paal?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, as Q1 evolves we will firm up our view on Q2 and the playbook we run through in Q4 to be right-sized for Q1, we will repeat if necessary during the first quarter to be right-sized for Q2.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. If I could just ask one more, what should we assume right now [inaudible] of the headcount reductions that are being made currently?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I am not going to predict the cost here but I will tell you that normally we recover our costs in the severance within the following time here. It's probably more than this number. So I have already covered in fact [inaudible] be within the 2015.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, I will turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jud Bailey", "Thank you, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Jud Bailey", "Paal, one thing that strikes us about this downturn relative to what we saw in 2008 and 2009 is the urgency of some of the large operators to cut back on their offshore spending very quickly. I would be curious to get your thoughts on deepwater activity in kind of the three main basins, Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Brazil, how your customers are approaching that and how you see the outlook there over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well if you look at global deepwater activity, it was down I think 6%, 7% in 2014 predominantly driven by Brazil and in 2015 at this stage and I am talking about deep water activity now, we still expect another 5% to 10% decline. Where it is going to come I think is a bit early to say. The Gulf of Mexico looks likely to be reasonably flat. As I just mentioned Brazil, there seems to be potentially further cuts in Brazil and I think there is still a bit lack of visibility in Angola. But I would say, 5% to 10% decline in activity is what we expect which is more I think in line with what we absorbed in 2014. Now I think with a big saving in deepwater drilling spend it's going to come in 2015, it's going to be around the rig rate which started to come down in 2014 but I think the big saving our customers are going to get on deepwater drilling in '15 is going to come from the rig rate.", "Jud Bailey", "Okay. And that kind of leads into my next question is, one thing that we've heard from rig contractors is more so than in '09 we are hearing from them that operators are approaching them more so than '09 on trying to renegotiate existing contracts. I would be curious how are your customers approaching you in terms of pricing? Are they looking to try to renegotiate existing contracts? And then also do you have a sense on the ability for you to sell them new technology to save time and cost, or are they just in the mode of trying to get cost down and not really looking at that aspect of it yet?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think on the deepwater size for our product and services, we do have discussions around trying to drive costs out of the system. But I would say our customers in this market segment in particular are still very-very focused on operational integrity and also looking at using the latest and best technologies to make sure that they drive performance through that. So we haven't really had any significant I would say price book discussions or requests for price book reduction. On the deepwater side it is more how we can work together to drive total cost down through better planning, through better execution, through less downtime, rather than specific price book discussion.", "Jud Bailey", "Okay. Thank you. I will turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie from Iberia Capital. Please go ahead.", "Rob MacKenzie", "Thank you. Good morning guys. I wanted to ask about technology adoption, something you highlighted again in your press release, specifically on US land. And my question is are you seeing a greater or lesser propensity of operators to adopt technology in the effort to drive down -- or drive up -- returns in this cycle? One might think you would but operators typically haven't always behaved that way.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Oh, you are right. In North America land that has been the situation. I would say that we are seeing or in 2014 we did see a growing uptake and a growing appetite to apply new technologies to drive both higher production and lower cost to improve cost per barrel. So I would say that BroadBand family of stimulation technologies is a very good example of this. Highway was one of the first and a major technology innovations on the fact side in terms of fluids for quite a while. As we introduced it in 2011, it grew very fast. But with the BroadBand family which was introduced in the early part of 2014, this is currently growing at four times the pace. So part of this is that we have engaged our customers in a slightly different way this time around for BroadBand and we have met myself and my team included with a range of our customers at the CEO, COO level to lay out firstly what the technology does but also to give them introductory offers to basically demonstrate what these technologies can do and I believe that when we introduce them in this way then the adaptation to all these organizations actually is quicker and more significant.", "Rob MacKenzie", "So when they come to you as many of them say they are doing now coming to their vendors and asking for price concessions, how does that change the conversation?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I think our customers still look to drive down total cost or improved cost per barrel and when they engage in these discussions there is already pretty clear on the standing of what some of these technologies have already done for them, and when we have commercial discussions these improvements and these benefits that we offer are factored into the overall situation when we discussed pricing with them.", "Rob MacKenzie", "Thank you.", "Simon Farrant", "That's all the time we have for the questions today. And now on behalf of the Schlumberger management team, I would like to thank you for participating in today's call. Greg will now provide the closing comments.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston.", "Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our first comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information, is included in the earnings press release on our website.", "We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share, excluding charges earning credits, was $1.06. This represents decreases of $0.44 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the same quarter last year.", "During the quarter, we recorded $439 million of pretax charges. This includes $390 million of charges associated with the headcount reduction of 11,000, as well as an incentivized leave of absence program. This program provides us with some flexibility as we manage the uncertainties of the current environment.", "In Venezuela, during the first quarter, the SICAD II exchange rate of VEF50 to $1 was eliminated and replaced with a new system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI rate was approximately VEF192 as of the end of the quarter. As a result, we recorded $49 million of devaluation charge during the first quarter. After this charge, the U.S. dollar value of our Bolivar denominated net assets is not material. Therefore, any further devaluations of the Bolivar will not have a significant impact on our results.", "Our first quarter revenue of $10.2 billion decreased 19% sequentially, while pretax operating margin decreased 255 basis points. Approximately 25% of the sequential revenue decline was attributable to the currency effect and the absence of the year-end increase in product, software and multi-client sales that we experienced last quarter. The remaining decrease was driven by activity and price declines.", "Despite the very challenging environment, pretax operating margin declined 255 basis points sequentially which resulted in incremental margins of only 33%. This is a result of prompt and proactive cost management across the organization. It's worth noting that although our revenue was significantly impacted by the fall in value of many currencies, this phenomenon does not have a significant impact on our pretax operating income. This reflects the benefit of our local cost structure which largely serves as the natural hedge against currency movements on our bottom line.", "Highlights by both product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.6 billion, decreased 21% sequentially, while margins decreased 447 basis points, to 25.7%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower multi-client and software sales and a fall in higher margin exploration activity. Drilling group revenue of $4 billion decreased 15% sequentially, while margins only declined 80 basis points. These declines were primarily driven by the severe rig count drop in North America.", "Production group revenue of $3.8 billion decreased 22% sequentially and margins fell by 389 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and pricing pressure in North America land. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 20.9% in the first quarter, compared to 21.4% in the previous quarter.", "This decrease reflects the fact that we generated a smaller portion of our pretax income in North America during Q1. As we [indiscernible] throughout the year, the EPR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings. We generated almost $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations and net debt increased $100 million during the quarter, to $5.5 billion. This is all despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1 which is driven by the annual associated with employee compensation, as well as the payment of $245 million in severance during the quarter.", "Even with the challenges of the current market, we still anticipate generating very strong free cash flow. This is because, during the downturn, we continue to reduce our investment in CapEx and working capital requirements will also come down. This combination should more than offset the decrease in earnings.", "During the quarter, we spent $719 million to repurchase 8.7 million shares, at an average price of $82.98. We spent $606 million on CapEx, full year 2015 CapEx, excluding multi-client and SBM investment, is now expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.", "And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter revenue declined 19%, driven by the activity collapse on land in North America and the associated pricing pressure. International activity was lower, as customers cut budgets in response to lower commodity prices and was also impacted by the normal seasonal effects in the northern hemisphere and the fall of certain local currencies against the U.S. dollar.", "In spite of these top line headwinds, we have been able to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins, to prompt and proactive cost management and by further accelerating our transformation program. This is reflected in our first quarter international margins which are essentially flat sequentially and are up year-over-year. We have also delivered better decrementals than in any previous downturn, with sequential decremental margins as low as 33%, with North America and the international areas achieving 39% and 25%, respectively.", "The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly in North America, has been almost unprecedented and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar. And while we thought we had adequate plans in place going into the quarter, activity declined even faster than expected which required us to revise our plans accordingly. This made managing the quarter challenging, including the decision to further reduce our workforce by 11,000 employees, bringing the total personnel reduction to 20,000 or around 15%, compared to the peak of the third quarter of 2014.", "Looking at our corporate financial performance, we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow, before restructuring payments, during the first quarter. And we remain confident in our ability to generate free cash, even in these market conditions. And we expect to maintain the cash quality of our earnings by continuing to convert 75% or more of our net income into free cash flow.", "By geography, our North American revenue decreased 25% sequentially which was significantly lower than the 32% drop in land rig count. Operating margins in North America decreased 670 basis points sequentially, to 12.9%.", "In spite of these severe activity and pricing declines, sequential decrementals were limited to 39%, as we maintain -- as we remain fully focused on flawless execution and proactive cost management. In U.S. land, drilling and stimulation activity was down in all basins, while activity also dropped significantly in Canada, while the reduction in rig count was further impacted by the early Spring breakup. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we're seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers.", "On land in North America, pricing pressure was greatest for hydraulic fracturing services, although some of this impact was mitigated to increase new technology uptake, particularly for our BroadBand stimulation services and Infinity completions products. In spite of this, market pricing for certain products and services has already reached unsustainable levels; however, we're being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss making contracts.", "We continue to work with our customers to have lower drilling and completion costs, by focusing on the savings that new virtuals and technologies can bring. We're doing this through our technology integration groups, that house the full arrangement of shale expertise, spanning formation evaluation, drilling, stimulation and completions. The experts making up these integration groups are located in the larger shale basins in North America land and have both the scientific understanding of how to optimize shale developments and also an in-depth knowledge of our complete technology offering which they combine to design the best solution for each reservoir and each well.", "The track record we have established over the past five years has now given us the confidence to propose a range of new business models to our customers, where we initially absorb the incremental cost linked to our work flows and technologies, in return for an upside based on the actual production results. One example of our unique shale technologies is HiWAY which helps customers increase production and ultimate recovery while using less water and proppant.", "In the period between 2012 and 2014, wells completed with HiWAY technology in the Eagle Ford showed a 26% increase in the best three months of production, compared to wells stimulated with conventional treatments. HiWAY technology also helped save around 1.4 billion gallons of fracturing fluid and about 2.8 billion pounds of proppant, in more than 1,000 wells. The success of the HiWAY technology is now being complimented and extended by the rapid uptake of BroadBand Sequence which has already shown remarkable performance for a range of customers in both new well completions and in refracturing of old wells.", "In the international markets, revenue declined 16% sequentially, driven by seasonal weather impact, currency effects and customer spending cuts. But despite the severity of the sequential revenue decline and the unfavorable shift in revenue mix, we managed to minimize the impact on our pretax operating margins which was essentially flat with the previous quarter, at 24.1%.", "This performance was achieved by strong execution, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program. Which together, were able to offset the margin impact from both reduced activity and the pricing pressure we were seeing from all customer groups.", "In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms.", "Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 13% sequentially, while pretax operating margin improved by 30 basis points, to 28.6%. Performance was impacted by a double-digit sequential drop in revenue in the Asia Pacific region and by lower product and software sales, but was partially offset by robust activity in the DTC region.", "Year-on-year revenue decreased 5% and margins grew by 230 basis points. In the Middle East region, our lump-sum turnkey projects in Saudi Arabia gained momentum during the first quarter and we expect solid drilling activity going forward, together with more fracturing and rigless work.", "In the United Arab Emirates, development activity on the North Island of the [indiscernible] project has now started, with more rig additions planned over the next few quarters. On this project, Schlumberger has been awarded the five-year contract for the supply of integrated well construction services, with further details provided in our earnings press release. Activity in the rest of the DCC countries was also strong in the first quarter. While in Iraq, revenues in the North remain muted, at around half of the peak levels seen in 2014 and activity in the South of the country was steady around the levels seen in the fourth quarter.", "In Southeast Asia, activity in China was seasonally lower in the first quarter, but activity also declined in the rest of the regions, as customer budget cuts continued to be implemented. In Latin America, revenue declined 20% sequentially, while pretax operating margin improved 59 basis points, to 21.5%.", "Revenue was impacted by decreased activity in Mexico, Brazil and Columbia, as customer budgets were cut and also by the fall in the value of the Venezuelan Bolivar. Still, these effects were partially offset by slight activity increases in Venezuela, Argentina and Ecuador. Year-on-year revenue decreased 6% and margins grew by 39 basis points. In Venezuela, activity continued to improve with [indiscernible] and with several of the joint ventures in the Faja, while activity is also ramping up in Trinidad.", "In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly on a combination of customer budget cuts, as well as seasonal weather effects that mainly impacted offshore activity. The reduced spend mainly affected non-development activity, although some exploration work was also delayed. Elsewhere in Latin America, offshore activity in Brazil remains weak, with a deepwater slowdown continuing, as Petrobras announced budget cuts early in the quarter. In Argentina, activity remains resilient in the first quarter, driven by simulation work and continued new technology uptake in the Vaca Muerta and with new project startups offsetting the completion of others.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenues fell 17% sequentially, with margins declining by 133 basis points, to 21%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 12% and margins grew by 66 basis points. The revenue decline was mainly due to continued weakness in the ruble and lower seasonal activity in Russia. In the UK North Sea, exploration activity fell to its lowest level in recent history, as customer spending decelerated, while rig count in the Norwegian sector appears to have reached a bottom. In Sub-Sahara Africa, both development and exploration activity was down sequentially across the region. In Algeria, our activity was flat sequentially, while work in Libya was limited to offshore locations, with onshore operations largely shut down for the quarter.", "Looking at the industry as a whole, the current financial challenges will not disappear, even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is therefore forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs and create more project value. And we have seen a much closer collaboration between operators and large service companies, as a significant opportunity to create technical solutions that will achieve these objectives.", "At Schlumberger, we're ready to enter into these types of collaborations. And based on our technical and financial strength, we're also prepared to promote more risk-based contract models, where we're compensated based on the solutions we have designed, as well as on the performance of our execution. And these contract structures are currently being tabled with a number of customers as part of the ongoing commercial discussions.", "Turning to the 2015 outlook, visibility still remains limited. However, we expect the largest open in E&P investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30%. We further believe that a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time, as the inventory of uncompleted wells builds and as the refracturing market expands. We also anticipate that our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels, hence extending the period of weak pricing.", "In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P spend to fall around 15% which will create challenges in terms of both activity and pricing levels, but considerably less than the headwinds seen in North America. The reduction in international spend will be seen primarily through lower activity levels, but also with some pricing impact for basic technologies and with a continuation of the already observed shift from exploration-related services towards more development activity.", "In terms of geography, we expect the G to C states of the Middle East to increase investments in 2015, as the core part of OPEC prepares to recoup market share, as the rest of the global supply base continues to weaken. Elsewhere, we expect to see a double-digit reduction in E&P investment levels in Latin America, led by Mexico and Brazil. In Europe and Africa, led by the North Sea and Sub-Sahara Africa. And in Asia, led by China, Malaysia and Australia.", "In Russia, conventional land activity in western Siberia continues to be resilient, but the overall revenue contribution from Russia will remain subdued until there is a meaningful recovery in the ruble exchange rate. While the global fall in activity level is severe, we remain focused on the things we can control which are our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide.", "We remain confident in our ability to weather the storm better than our surroundings, based on our favorable international leverage, our fair technology leadership in North America shale and the acceleration of our transformation program. These elements will together create the platform that should allow us to increase revenue market share from slower earnings per share reductions that our peers in the coming quarters and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity, while delivering on matched levels of free cash flow.", "Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. First question is from Ole Slorer. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer", "Yes, thanks a lot and congrats with some pretty magnificent effects on the efficiency initiatives that you're implementing. But my opening question would be, Paal, if you could just update us on your macro thoughts, the same way as you did on the previous two quarters? And your comments that the markets might be tightening in the second half of the year, particularly with respect to how you see non-OPEC, non-U.S., that 50 million barrel a day bracket, be affected by the lack of investment that we've seen over the past couple of years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So our view on the macro hasn't really changed, compared to what we said both on the October and January call. First of all, the 2015 oil demand remains strong. And I was actually right [indiscernible] in the latest IA report. It would now be about 1.1 million barrels per day. While on the supply side, we continue to see the market share battle playing out globally.", "Now the key question, as we discussed before, is when and where the large cuts in E&P investment is going to show up in the supply numbers. And the latest production data from March is now showing the first signs of a tightening in supply. And we're basically looking at three main indicators.", "The first one is the core OPEC spare capacity which was down by 400,000 barrels in March, to 2.5 million barrels. The other one is the one you alluded to which is the non-NAM and OPEC production which showed a slight weakening in the first quarter versus the first quarter of last year. And given the reduction in E&P spend internationally; we expect this weakening to continue throughout this year.", "And the third one which everyone is looking at, is the U.S. monthly sequential production which is now showing the first signs of flattening. So based on this, as we said in January, we expect the global supply to continue to tighten in the second half of this year, so really no major change to our view on the macro.", "Ole Slorer", "And the follow-up question will just be on where you think you stand on your goals that you outlined at the analyst day last summer? I think you mentioned that you expected to be in the sixth to seventh inning or something like that, by 2017. But it looks as if things are going at lot faster. So just in terms of this understanding the momentum and how much more there is to -- juice there is to squeeze out of this lemon, could you give us your latest view on that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So if you look at how we're driving business performance today which a lot of the focus is around managing decrementals, there is really three components that are part of driving this performance. First is the transformation of the mindset of our entire organization, where we have, in the past couple years, taken teamwork and the tightness of the chain of command to a completely new level. So this allows us now to plan and execute and also to adjust with great pace and agility, all right And this is the process that had been going on for a number of years. And I think it really demonstrated the -- our capabilities, coming from this transformation and in the first quarter.", "Now the second is just diligent focus on basic cost and resource management. And this includes both our internal cost structures, as well as the third party spend. And although we did well in the first quarter in this area, as well, these efforts are going to continue into the second quarter.", "And then the third one is really the one that you're referring to which is the structural transformation of how we run the entire company. And here, we said we would be in the sixth to seventh inning in 2017. I would say that today, we're probably in the third inning, if you want to stick to baseball terminology.", "It's a multi-year program. It's going to bring a steady contribution to our performance and we're today active in looking to accelerate the pace of this implementation and there is a great pool from the entire organization now to accelerate this and I'm very pleased with the overall progress, in terms of how we're doing.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert", "I wanted to actually reference your presentation of a few weeks ago which I thought was one of the better efforts, not only from Schlumberger but just from any industry participant in some time, so first of all with regard to a question regarding business model. You've referenced this in your earnings release, you've also referenced it several times, being prepared to move to more risk-based business models. And specifically, the significant opportunity associated with the re-fracking of older wells.", "So what kind of uptake are you seeing, with regard to the re-fracking opportunity? And when you describe this as a significant opportunity, can you quantify what that means, in terms of how large it is?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "If you look at the work we've done so far and we posted some of the recent results in the earnings press release this quarter, a lot of the re-frack focus so far has been around being able to identify the candidates. And that's based on our understanding of the existing completions and the potential that these still hold.", "And then the other part is around, how do you effectively do the refracturing while minimizing the costs. So we have, to our engineer completion and our shale formation evaluation capabilities, as well as BroadBand Sequence, now established that growth technology offering. So in terms of how many wells, I would say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for refracturing and this is both shale liquids and shale gas.", "In terms of the market potential, I think you're talking billions, in terms of revenue opportunities, over an extended period of time. But this is quite a significant market opportunity. And I think the key here is that we're so confident in our ability to identify the right candidates and execute the refracturing work that we're prepared to take significant risks, in terms of how we go about doing this work. In many cases, if we can select the candidates, prepare to foot the entire bill for the refracturing work and then get paid back in production.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay and then second question is more of a macro question. Again referencing back to this presentation that you did a couple weeks ago -- the global drilling intensity slide, in which you juxtaposed the 2014 production numbers from the big three liquids producers, roughly the same, at about 11 million barrels per day. But significantly different levels of drilling activity to generate that output. 36,000 wells U.S., 8,700 for Russia and 399 for Saudi Arabia. And you also mentioned a host of markets that you didn't identify, but significantly lower than the U.S., with regard to drilling intensity.", "So you stated that basically, required level of drilling intensity for many of the Markets, to keep production flat. But the question that I have is not only to keep production flat, but the production -- the flexibility and the wherewithal to increase production with increased drilling intensity. Can you speak to that, please?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "What they're saying with that slide is that over time, basins mature. And in order to firstly maintain production and subsequently increase production which I think, in many of the land basins, we will be looking to do that in the coming years, you will have to increase drilling intensity. That's the basic message.", "So I think you're seeing that increase in drilling intensity happening in many basins around the world today. The drilling intensity is obviously generally far below what we're seeing today in North America land.", "But that's basically because, in most of the other basins, we're still working within the conventional resource base. And as you move from the conventional towards more unconventional, you will also generally see an increase in drilling intensity from that. But I would say, even in the conventional basin, there is a growing drilling intensity which we're now looking to capitalize on, both through the subsurface integration of the [indiscernible] assembly, as well as now going forward with our focusing on establishing our read on the future.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go to Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jim Wicklund", "Relative to Bill's question, I guess, I find the most fascinating thing about the call today is, you're willing to propose a range of different business models, take some incremental technology risk and you talk about a new way of working together. So we're not just talking re-frack market in the U.S. You're sounding like a whole new business model of how service companies and oil companies will operate in the future? I don't mean to sound too Star Treky.", "But you're proposing something other than -- in the past, companies have been willing to take participation or risk at the bottom of a cycle. But you're talking about a structural change in the industry, it sounds like.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I do, yes. And I think it's going to be very important, for the overall performance of the industry, that all the players that have something to contribute, not only to the implementation and execution part of the work we do. But also to how we design the solutions of what we're looking to build and develop, that they're all invited to the table. And I would say still remaining humble. I think we, from the Schlumberger side, we have a lot to contribute, when it comes to supporting the design decisions that many of our customers take for major drilling and completions developments.", "Jim Wicklund", "There is no question that you have more expertise than most any other oil company. But having worked for both oil companies and service companies, service company comes to me in the oil company and says, let me show you a better way to do stuff. The first reaction is, I got engineers that know how to do it. So this is pretty much a change in psychology, if you would or how the industry operates. You're talking about, this isn't a quick implementation, I would think, but over time?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, it's not a quick implementation and it's not something that we can do by ourselves. And currently, I think it's very clear. We're not saying that we can do the work our customers are doing better. But I think, given the capabilities that we have, I think we're underutilized today. And we have a lot more to contribute, even into the design elements of the work that is related to our expertise.", "And I think by being invited to the table to contribute, complementing what they are doing, I think we can achieve improvements in design and engineer costs out of the system, before we go to implementation. And by factoring in our implementation or execution capabilities in the design, I think we can also simplify and streamline the execution part of the work, as well.", "So this is something that we're going to offer, Jim. Some of our customers might take us up on it and some of the others might not and for the ones that are not, we will continue to work the way we're currently doing. But I think this is something that we believe can bring significant value and something that we're prepared to take on and also put some more skin in the game.", "Operator", "Thank you. David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.", "David Anderson", "A related question what Jim was asking. I was wondering, more specifically, around offshore development and exploration. Obviously, with lower oil prices, it is a really challenging market right now. Some would even say the IOC business model is broken.", "It looks to us like maybe in a couple years, this could be in a slowdown here. So I'm just wondering, this is a pretty big part of your business. Schlumberger's oil -- the services part, in the scheme of things, is in a huge park. Can you just help us under -- give us a bit of a road map for how you think some of the IOCs are going to navigate to the deepwater and exploration? And how you see this progressing, in order to get this fixed?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think if you look at deepwater first, this represents a huge resource base for the industry. Now given the level of development cost today, as well as given the level of recovery factors we're seeing today, the cost per barrel for these type of developments is challenged.", "So there has to be a change in overall, in how these developments are done. We have to get the costs down and we also have to drive recovery up. And if you can do both, I think a large part of the reserve base and the discovery base that we have established over the past decade in deepwater, can and will be developed.", "So I think this is the challenge that the industry has and we're prepared to contribute towards finding the right solutions. And I think when the industry really puts their mind to something, we will find a solution and it will be sorted out. As to the [Technical Difficulty] separation, I think the play book we're seeing now is the normal one. Exploration is the first thing that can be cut which is not going to have a short-term and immediate impact on production.", "Looking at the current levels of exploration spend today, it is clearly unsustainable. I don't think it's going to get fixed or improved any time soon or at least not in 2015. But it is very clear that this level of exploration spend is not going to continue for many years.", "David Anderson", "Okay. And a separate topic on talking about the North America, you've talked about how the rig count won't go back to peak levels and I think we can all agree upon that. You talked a lot about the commentary around re-fracking opportunities. And clearly, you see that as a big opportunity, going forward. But what are some of the other structural trends that you think are influencing that view?", "What are the other components that, as you think about North America and I'm not sure if you can give us an idea of where you think that rig count can be a normalized rig count, if you will. But can you talk about some of the other factors, structurally, that are impacting that view?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think if you look at what's taken place over the past three or four years in shale liquids in North America, there has been a significant growth in activity and there has been a growing free cash flow deficit for the E&P industry. So that's clearly not a sustainable way of the whole industry to operate here. Now, with that said, I think there's a core part of the North America shale liquids that is viable, even at the current oil prices and this will continue to be developed.", "Now as we go forward, as the industry continues to improve. I would say, both on the cost side -- although a lot has already been done -- but even more so on the production per well. I think there can be a growing part of the -- I would say tier 2 and tier 3 acreage that can be developed.", "But as of now, I think we're limited more to the tier 1 acreage at these type of oil prices. And that's why we're saying that, given the cash flow constraints, we don't expect that rig counts are going to come back to the previous levels of around 2000. It's going to come back to somewhere in between the current levels and where it was.", "And for the service industry, that means that the pricing concessions that are currently being given, we unfortunately are going to have to live with for a while, because there's going to be a pretty significant order capacity for all sorts of services, given the lower activity level that we're going to recover to.", "Operator", "Next question is from Jim Crandell with Cowen Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jim Crandell", "My question has to do with the overall trend in international revenues and margins for here. If we look back at past cycles, often, the international business trends materially lag that of North America. I understand some things are different this time. But might we be looking at, generally, a deteriorating overall level of E&P spend? And maybe even Schlumberger revenue over the next 12 months?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "If you look at our view on total E&P spend globally, splitting it into North America and international, we're saying that the reduction in spending internationally is going to be significantly lower than what you see in North America. North America is going to be well above 30% and while we're saying around 15% for international.", "So I think the key, beyond what the spend reduction is -- and we're already seeing that spend reduction. And by the way, international spend was more or less flat already in 2014. I think the key from our side is the underestimated, I would say, resilience in our international business performance. If you look at how we've been managing to keep margins and also to continue to protect our overall earnings capacity in the international business, we're doing a pretty good job.", "And I think even with a 15% reduction in E&P spend, our revenues, year-over-year, was down 8% in the first quarter and our operating income was down 3%. So the key areas are our ability to continue to generate earnings, even in very challenging market conditions.", "Jim Crandell", "Do you think that the -- given your comments, have you seen your overall bottom in international revenues? Or do you think your overall international revenues will probably trend lower from the first quarter levels?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, at this stage, we see both North America and international revenue coming down further in Q2 [indiscernible]. But I would say more so in North America than in international.", "Jim Crandell", "And do you think that that will represent the bottom? Or do you think there could be further slippage in revenues, particularly internationally, in the second half of the year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I would say that the revenue reductions in Q2 are slowing in pace. I'm not ready to say that it's the bottom yet.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go to Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte", "If I could follow up quickly on this re-frack opportunity. I'm curious as to what the suite of services are? And how they differ from a conventional primary frack job? I imagine it's a lot more analysis involved. Can you just walk us through what the work flow looks like? And the level of intellectual capital that's employed in the process?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, sure. So the overall work flow starts with us basically getting the well files and the well data from the operator. Our team of experts is then reviewing hundreds of candidate wells and we're taking the ones that we believe have the highest potential for increasing production after re-fracking treatment. So they're looking at the completion. They are looking at whatever formation evaluation data we have and then coming up with our candidate selection.", "Now in terms of the actual physical work execution at the well site, the first thing we need to do is to pull the pump out of the well and then prepare the well. But beyond that, it's just hooking up the fracturing treatment. And we basically pump a normal fracturing job, but with a BroadBand Sequence [indiscernible] space into the job. Generally then flooding off the existing perforations that have already been fracked, to be able to elevate the pressure in the well to fracture the additional perforations that initially weren't fracked when the well was first completed.", "So the key enablers here are the ability of our subsurface experts to identify the right well candidates. And in addition to that, the BroadBand Sequence, the technology, where we can actually divert fracturing fluid into the perforations that haven't properly been fractured in the first place.", "Michael LaMotte", "And is there any limitation, in terms of the initial completion, the hardware, the construction of that well? Any physical limitation?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No.", "Michael LaMotte", "If I could ask a follow-up for Simon, real quick. Just on the working capital numbers. The receivable turns looked pretty good, but working capital use in the first quarter was still pretty high. Is that inventory? Can you delve into that a little bit, Simon?", "Simon Ayat", "Normally, we have seasonality to the working capital and the first quarter is a quarter where we consume working capital. And this year around, actually the receivable was a positive. Inventory stayed flattish, but the biggest consumption was on the accounts payable and employee payable.", "The first quarter, we basically meet all of the requirements of the incentives, the bonuses of the previous year. And as we highlighted, we also had the payment associated with the restructuring of $245 million. So the main impact on the working capital came from the other elements that I highlighted. So over $1 billion, by the way, Michael.", "Michael LaMotte", "Yes, that $245 million was in that, then, as well?", "Simon Ayat", "The $245 million was a restructuring cost, with Venezuela, obviously, it's not the cash element. The biggest issue is, as I mentioned, accounts payable and employee payable was more than $1 billion of deterioration.", "Michael LaMotte", "And then Simon, Paal mentioned 75% plus free cash flow conversion as a target. The Free Cash Flow deployment in the repurchase program was also impressively high. Is there a target there that we can apply, going forward?", "Simon Ayat", "So as we always said, Michael, the number or the amount that we will spend on the buyback is always a balancing number. Our priority is to invest in the business, whether it's CapEx or future revenue stream, SPM, multi-client. And then the dividend, obviously, we will continue to meet our commitment and revise it every year. And the balancing period will always be the buyback. And during the downturn, the conversion rate, you know, is always helping.", "Michael LaMotte", "Higher, yes.", "Simon Ayat", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "It's great to see when everything -- the whole plan comes into fruition and everything you outlined last year at your June energy investor day, so congrats on that performance.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Kurt Hallead", "You're welcome. The follow-up question that I've been having and we had an opportunity to canvas a number of different investors last night and it still seems the primary question on everybody's mind, from this point forward, is how sustainable is this relative performance on decrementals? I think you addressed it broadly in your commentary, about the execution and transformation and so on.", "And I think the million-dollar question out there is, are the decremental margins going to moderate into the second quarter and then second half of the year, from where they are in the first quarter? And in conjunction with that, how much of this decremental margin performance has really been, say \"one-off\"? Or how much of this decremental performance is truly structural in nature?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "If we focus in our discussion on decrementals around international business, right, where our decrementals sequentially, in Q1, was 25%, I think this performance is -- first of all, nothing one-off in that performance. And secondly, that performance is not just one quarter, either. I think the overall resilience in our well-balanced international business is largely underestimated. Actually, if you look at the performance going back to 2012, we posted 35% incrementals in 2012, 42% in 2013 and 69% in 2014.", "So the fact that we have a very good handle of running the international business, in an environment where we've been facing growing headwinds throughout this period, both in exploration, in deepwater and seismic. And also with significant IOC spend costs, even starting in 2014, I think these incrementals clearly show that the decrementals we're posting in Q1 is just a continuation of a multi-year run of improving business performance.", "Kurt Hallead", "Now the follow-up I would have is, you talk about -- you outlined a view that the U.S. recovery will not match prior activity levels in a period of pricing pressure could be upon us for a period of time. Now in the context, the re-frack -- and I'm just trying to connect the dots. Because if there's a significant amount of re-frack that's going to happen, I would have personally thought that that would lead to a more rapid capacity absorption period and potentially a faster recovery period, in terms of pricing because everyone is going to get all this backlog of re-frack.", "So can you just -- I might be a little bit slow. Can you help me connect the dots on how re-fracking won't lead to an acceleration in capacity absorption? And get your thoughts on that would be great.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think for the re-frack, this work scope, I think, is going to be limited to the companies that can do the two things that I stated earlier. Firstly, help the customers identify the right candidate. And secondly, have technologies that make the cost base of the refracturing feasible and economical. And based on the work we've done, in terms of identifying candidates during trials, re-fracks for a range of customers already, the economics, based on the BroadBand Sequence technology, is actually quite attractive in between re-fracking an old well or drilling a new well. So I think it would be limited to the companies that have that capability.", "Now even if there were a range of companies that could do it, I still think that this market overall, in terms of absorbing capacity, isn't going to fix the problem. So if you look at the overall activity that we had last year, where we had about 2000 rigs operating, we're down now below 1000. If you take a pick anywhere in between the two numbers of where the recovery is going to come back, no matter what number you pick I think it's very clear that it's going to be significant over-capacity in the market.", "And that means that pricing that is now already at very low levels is not going to improve in that situation. So re-frack is an opportunity for the companies that have the right technology to it. I don't think it's going to have a big enough impact to fix the overall capacity issue in North America land. But it will be, I think, a very good avenue of growth for the companies that can identify the right candidates and also have the technology to effectively re-frack, while keeping costs low enough to make it economical.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go to Daniel Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Boyd", "So Paal, you'll typically gain market share in a downturn and you're looking for E&P spend internationally down 15%. So should we take that and suggest that Schlumberger is going -- to revenues will decline something less than 15% this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think we have some good opportunities this year to gain market share. We talked about that in the January call. I think the -- this whole discussion around what we perceive to be the glass ceiling in the international market will potentially open up more market share opportunities for us. I think also, given the fact that we're able to run a very good and very effective business internationally, would also allow us opportunities to leverage that capability to further gain market share as well.", "So we're not going to be obsessed about market share, other than, we're going to look for the opportunities. And we want to continue to navigate the commercial landscape by balancing both market share with continuous margin performance.", "Daniel Boyd", "So that's what I would expect, too. And then if you do the algebra, it implies sequential growth internationally in the back half of this year. But my question really comes down to international margins, because last cycle, we saw international margins bleed lower, even as revenues started increasing. What's your thought process? Or how do you think this cycle plays out?", "Are we in a different position, whereas revenue increases, we could actually have slightly higher margins? Or is the pricing -- negative pricing impact going to bleed through again?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We're already seeing challenges, both in activity and pricing and it's not the market. Obviously, with these significant spend reductions that's always going to be there. I think the difference we're seeing, at this stage, is that based on these incrementals that I referenced just in the previous question, our ability to continuously drive performance, to how we execute internationally and leveraging the scale we have of operations. And also have a steady contribution from the transformation that is what is allowing us to hold margins up the way they are.", "We have significantly outperformed our competitors in margins over the previous two or three years and this has just got nothing to do with pricing. Every bid on lowest price for basic technologies in any country around the world, the only thing that differentiates us from the competition is that we're able to translate this revenue into higher margins, basically based on how we run the company.", "So we're always winning any bid on the lowest price. And we have to be commercially competitive. But the key here is the internal [indiscernible] of the company and how we run and execute. And I think that ability has improved significantly over the past three or four years. And that's why we hope that we should be able to manage both decrementals and overall margins better, this time around, in the international market, than what we've done in previous cycles.", "Daniel Boyd", "So in other words as revenue increases you hope to, at a minimum maintain your margin level, at that point?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We're continuing to try to do better than what we did in previous cycles, yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of James West with Evercore. Please go ahead.", "James West", "I was wanting to ask about BroadBand Sequence and I spent a lot of time with your technology guys last month in Houston. How much of that business now is a push model, being you going to your clients and talking to them about the attributes of that versus a pull model, where the clients are actually coming to you saying, we need this technology?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I still think there is a mixture that any new technology in North America land, the uptake takes some time. But what we did differently this time around, with broadband in general versus what we did with HiWAY, is that in the third quarter last year, myself and a few of my chiefs, we went around to a range of North American E&P companies and presented the concept of this technology, and also offered them trial runs to try this out.", "And that's why the general uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly faster than what HiWAY was which was always, actually, quite good, as well, in 2011. But the rate of uptake of BroadBand Sequence has been significantly higher than what HiWAY was.", "James West", "Okay, got it. And then just an unrelated follow-up, we think about the international markets and I know you touched a lot on the U.S. market and production there. But internationally, that's a pretty heavy decline rates, as well, a lack of investment international markets. What do you see as the potential for a significant drop in supply from the international side? And on that topic, is it possible not to be bullish on at least brent prices, going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think you're right. We believe that there is a weakness in the non-NAM, non-OPEC supply base. It was basically flat Q1, year-over-year. But given the reductions we're seeing in spend and the weakness in several of the key basins, we expect that weakness to continue and potentially increase, as the year progresses and I think that's why we believe that there will be some recovery in Brent. The question is, to what extent OPEC wants or is willing, to put more barrels on the market to stabilize prices at some level below $100.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll turn it back to our speakers.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you. So before we close, I would like to thank all of you for participating in today's call. As your questions have indicated, you're all concerned that this market is quite challenging at the moment. I think it's useful to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning.", "First, the past quarter has been challenging to manage. But by being able to quickly adjust plans and by continuing to focus on what we control, we have delivered significantly better decremental margins, compared to previous cycles. And our international leverage and the acceleration of our transformation program, are together creating a strong platform for financial out-performance, also, going forward.", "Second, we believe that the industry needs to think differently, in order to reduce project costs and increase project value. And we see closer collaboration between operators and the large service companies as a key element in achieving this goal. And this closer collaboration should also include more performance-based contracting models which we're fully prepared to enter into.", "And last, while we continue to actively manage cost and resources throughout this downturn, by streamlining overhead structures and reducing field capacity, we can quickly add back capacity when opportunities arise to take on more work. Through the efficiency gains created by our transformation program and through our unmatched recruiting and training machine which is fully intact.", "That concludes the call for today. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T executive teleconference.

There will be an opportunity for your questions; instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder today's call is being recorded.", "I'll turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead sir.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from London where the Schlumberger Limited board meeting took place yesterday.", "Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer.", "Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paul. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paul will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind our participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information is included in the earnings press release on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "I will now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you Simon. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $0.88. This represents decreases of $0.18 sequentially and $0.49 when compared to the same quarter last year.", "Our second quarter revenue of $9 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the very challenging environment, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 49 basis points sequentially. This resulted in decremental margins of just 23%, which is a result of continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization.", "Sequential highlights by product group were as follows: second quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $2.4 billion decreased 5% sequentially. This decrease was largely driven by Wireline and Testing as a result of lower exploration spending. Pre-tax operating margins decreased 84 basis points to 26.5% as an impact of the lower exploration activities was offset by increased higher margin software sales.", "Drilling Group revenue of $3.5 billion decreased 11%, primarily due to the further significant drop in the North America rig count. Margins remained resilient at 19.5% as the strong cost management limited the margin decline to only 44 basis points.", "Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 18% sequentially, as both activity and pricing for pressure pumping services in North America fell dramatically. Despite the severe revenue decline, margins only fell by 179 basis points to 12.8%.", "Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 21.1% in the second quarter. This was essentially flat when compared to the previous quarter. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the second quarter, we generated $2.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first half of 2015, we have generated $4.1 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $200 million during the second quarter and almost $0.5 billion during the first six months of the year.", "Net debt increased $111 million during the quarter to $5.6 billion. During the quarter, we spent $520 million to repurchase 5.8 million shares at an average price of $90 per share. We spent $587 million on CapEx during the second quarter. Full-year 2015 CapEx, excluding multiclient and SPM investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.", "And now, I will turn the conference call over to Paul.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you, Simon, and good morning everyone. Schlumberger revenue decreased 12% sequentially in the second quarter, driven by a significant reduction in land activity in the U.S. as the rig count decline accelerated, and by further pricing erosion in both North America and the international area.", "North America revenue fell 27% sequentially while international revenue was 5% lower, as customer budget cuts and pricing concessions impacted results for a full quarter. Despite the challenging market conditions, overall pre-tax operating margins were maintained well above the levels of previous downturns as we continue to proactively manage costs and resources, carefully navigate the commercial landscape and further accelerate our transformation program throughout the organization.", "The success of this approach can be seen in a double-digit pre-tax operating margin in North America and an international margin of 24.5%, which is 35 basis points up sequentially and 44 basis points up year-over-year. In the first half of 2015, year-over-year revenue has now dropped 26% in North America and 14% internationally. These levels exceed those of the 2009 downturn in both pace and size. Still, we have delivered first half decremental margins of 37% in North America and just 18% in the international area. These decremental margins represents a marked improvement over the equivalent figures from the last downturn which were in excess of 70%, particularly as we begin to approach what we believe is the market bottom.", "While the market remains tough, we also believe we have been successful in adapting to a rapidly changing situation as far as the size of our work force is concerned. The absence of charges in the second quarter is evidence of this, as the adjustments made in the second quarter were absorbed in our normal operating costs.", "In terms of corporate financial performance, we also generated almost $1.5 billion in free cash flow in the second quarter. This figure, which represents a conversion rate of 132% of the quarter's earnings into free cash flow, demonstrates our ability to generate free cash even in these market conditions.", "Looking at our results on a geographical basis, North American revenue decreased 27% sequentially, a figure greater than the 25% sequential decrease seen in the first quarter and, again, significantly lower than the fall in the land rig count which was down 40% sequentially in North America land. In spite of this drop, operating margins in North America decreased by only 268 basis points sequentially, leaving our margins 465 basis points higher than the same period of the 2009 downturn. The strength of this performance was underpinned by our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing impact of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management all together limiting the sequential decremental margins to 20%.", "In U.S., land activity was down in all basins in the second quarter with the rig count dropping below 860 for most of the month of June. In addition to the significant reduction in rig count, poor weather conditions with floods in Texas, Arkansas and Alaska also drove activity lower in the second quarter. The dramatic reduction in activity in U.S. land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels in particular for pressure pumping where many companies now are desperately fighting to survive.", "Our approach to the market remain unchanged in the second quarter where we concentrate our activity in core areas and for key customers and where we beyond this proceed with stacking of equipment rather than operating with large losses. We continue to maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term service capacity and we are working closely with our customers to help produce cost per barrel through better operational efficiency and reliability and through the application of new technology, work flows and business models.", "Based on this approach, we will ramp up our activity for opportunities that bring the required returns. The strength of our technology portfolio, the range of our work flow solutions and the depth of our shale understanding also enables us to pursue performance-based contracts where we initially underwrite the incremental cost of our technology and where we recover this cost plus the performance upside from incremental well production.", "In Western Canada, activity was also down significantly in the second quarter with the rig count falling by 66% sequentially impacted by the early spring break-up and with the recovery expected to be limited during the summer months.", "Offshore in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater rig activity was down in the second quarter and activity was also impacted by loop currents while pack ice of Eastern Canada also impacted our drilling and seismic operations in the second quarter. Offshore revenue was further impacted by the expected shift in service mix from exploration to development and completions as well as increasing pricing pressure. However, the primary driver for offshore success continues to be risk reduction and project performance and we are, therefore, fully engaged with our customers to help reduce overall AFE costs through better project planning and execution.", "In the international markets, revenue declined by 5% sequentially driven by further budget cuts from our customers as well as further pricing concession. For the first half of the year, revenue has now dropped 14% compared to last year, a figure that is more than doubled the 5% fall experienced over the same timeframe in the 2009 downturn. Second quarter operating margins of 24.5% was up 35 basis points sequentially and 44 basis points year-over-year as first half decremental margins were held to 18% compared to 73% over the same period in the 2009 downturn.", "These results fully demonstrate our leadership in the international markets which is built on flawless execution from the entire organization, proactive cost and resource management and the acceleration of our transformation program focused on work force productivity, asset utilization and reduction in unit support costs. In this environment, we focus on carefully balancing market share growth with protection of operating margin and by negotiating pricing concessions in return for additional work, integration opportunities or improved contract terms, knowing from experience that any permanent pricing concessions that we make will be very hard to recover even as market conditions improve.", "Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 8 basis points to 28.7%. Activity remained robust in the GCC region, however, strength in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait was not sufficient to offset weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Year-on-year revenue decreased by 13%, while margins expanded by 87 basis points.", "In the Middle East region, our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to gain momentum during the quarter however, our overall results were not immune to the customer pricing concessions we gave in the first quarter. In the United Arab Emirates, drilling and production related activity increased as work on the SARB North Island project ramped up and with further rig additions expected over the coming quarters. Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait, as the rig count increased in line with the country's strategic production targets, while unique land seismic activity grew with improved operational productivity.", "In Iraq, revenues in the north declined further in the second quarter, while activity in the south of the country remained flat sequentially but it's expected to increase in the second half of the year on the back of recent contract win.", "In Southeast Asia, activity fell in Australia as projects were completed both on land and offshore while activity in Malaysia declined as customer budget reductions affected both OpEx and CapEx investment.", "In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 81 basis points to 22.3%. Revenue was impacted once again by decreasing activity in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia however, somewhat offset by increased activity in Venezuela. Year-on-year revenue decreased 17% and margins grew by 111 basis points.", "In Mexico, revenue decreased significantly in the second quarter on further customer budget cuts that impacted both onshore and offshore activity. And in spite of new contract wins for both seismic and integrated well construction, the outlook for the second half of the year remains challenging. At the same time, the energy reform continues to progress on plan with the first major licensed award being announced in the third quarter.", "Offshore activity in Brazil remained weak with the deepwater rig count being down significantly versus the first quarter, while in Colombia, the activity slowdown continued and now affects all product line.", "In the Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago GeoMarkets, increased activity was driven by exploration work in Suriname and Guyana, while joint ventures in the Faja region of Venezuela continued to ramp up. Elsewhere in South America, revenue in Argentina remained resilient as growth in conventional activity partially offset pricing pressure for unconventional services. At the same time, SPM activity remains strong in Ecuador as the Shushufindi project continue to perform in line with expectations and with activity and production starting up on the new Kamana SPM project.", "In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue fell 5% sequentially with margins edging off by 29 basis points to 21.3%. Year-on-year revenue decreased 26% and margins dropped by 85 basis points. Within the area, revenue increased in Russia and Central Asia driven by the seasonal recovery of conventional land activity and as the ruble strengthened somewhat. In the North Sea, the shift from exploration to development related activity continued, while customer budget pressure both in the U.K. and Norway resulted in lower sales of new technology.", "In Sub-Saharan Africa both development and exploration activity was down sequentially as customer budget pressure resulted in several active rigs being demobilized. And in Algeria, activity was slightly up sequentially while work in Libya was limited as the security situation remained very challenging.", "One year ago at our 2014 investor conference, we told you about our transformation program, which is designed to provide a new approach to how we run our business in order to enable fundamentally better performance. Our transformation leverages the drivers of technology innovation, equipment reliability, process efficiency, and system integration, all together delivering better management of costs, better quality of products and service delivery, and better generation of free cash flow.", "While we set goals for new technologies and increasing elements of service integration, we also target a 10-fold reduction in customer non-productive time, a doubling in asset utilization, a 25% reduction in inventory days, a 20% increase in workforce productivity and a 10% lowering of unit support costs.", "I am very pleased with the progress we have made one year later. While the transformation was designed to deliver our performance in any part of the cycle, the current market conditions have enabled us to increase customer dialogue and to accelerate the program throughout our global organization. The strength of our international margins so far this year is one demonstration of the performance impact from our transformation while the resilience in our North American margins is another proof point.", "In terms of costs, our figures show that we are managing all aspects very well, including both fixed and variable compensation, as well as the cost of product and service delivery. In terms of quality, the investments we have made in training, new technology and enabling systems are now really starting to pay off, as can be seen by our second quarter quality results, where we set the new record low in terms of non-productive time incurred for our customers.", "Last, in terms of cash, the reduction in CapEx intensity and the discipline we have shown with respect to managing working capital has delivered a very strong free cash flow in the first half of the year, with a cash conversion rate of 98%, including severance payment, which is well above our 75% target.", "Turning now to the overall outlook for the second half of the year, visibility still remains limited. However, some tentative signs of change are emerging. On the supply side of the oil markets, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high-cost producers is still playing out, with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show. Within OPEC, production in the second quarter was at the highest level for three years, as marketed supply was again increased at the expense of lower core spare capacity, which, in June, dropped to 2.3 million barrels per day.", "In addition to this, non-NAM, non-OPEC production weakened in the first half of the year by 650,000 barrels per day, driven by Brazil and Mexico, with the further softening expected in the second half of the year, as the lower investment levels in many regions start to take full effect. Against these supply figures, global oil demand growth continues to strengthen, with the IEA having revised its 2015 estimate up to 1.4 million barrels per day during the second quarter. These factors all points to a potential tightening in the global supply demand balance in the coming quarters.", "Turning to our industry, the largest drop in E&P investments is, as expected, occurring in North America, where 2015 spend will now largely be down by more than 35%, driven by both pricing and activity on land. We do believe that the North American rig count has now reached bottom, but that we will only see a slow increase in drilling and completion activity in the second half of the year, which will not make any material dent in the massive overcapacity that has been created. This again means that there will be little to no improvement in pricing levels and, hence, the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future.", "In the international market, E&P spending is now expected to fall more than 15%, driven by lower activity in most regions and further amplified by a very strong dollar, in particular, versus the Russian ruble and the Venezuelan bolivar. Given the nature of the business in the international markets, we do not expect any upward adjustment to existing customer budgets for the second half of 2015. Instead, we see a continuation of the trends from the first half, with very low exploration activity, tight management of development related spend, and continued pricing pressure for our products and services. However, we do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016, or through exploration and development related activity.", "In the midst of the current market challenges, we remain focused on the things we can control, including our cost and resource base, the effective deployment of our technology and expertise, and the quality and integrity of the products and services we provide to our customers. The success of this approach is enabling us to maintain solid international margins despite a significant drop in activity, and at the same time, also allowing us to maximize our performance in North America. We remain very confident in our capacity to weather the current downturn better than our surroundings, and also significantly better than what we have done in previous downturns.", "Our global strength, our technology differentiation, and our accelerated corporate transformation is creating a great platform for us to increase revenue market share, post lower earnings per share reductions than our peers, and continue to reduce working capital and CapEx intensity to deliver unmatched levels of free cash flow. And at the same time, this financial strength positions us well to take advantage of increasing market opportunities resulting from the current market environment.", "Thank you very much. We will now open up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And first, with the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And thank you very much, and I think you're going to make it a difficult weekend for some of your peers since they ponder what they're going to say next week. But...", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I wonder whether we could revisit your macro view. Are you more confident or less confident that the oil markets are tightening than what you were a quarter ago, given the most recent IEA report and some of the resolutions around previously sanctioned countries?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, I think our view on the macro and our confidence in the tightening I think is relatively unchanged. We've been saying now, I think, for a number of quarters, that we see solid oil demand growth. And again, this was revised upwards again this year to 1.4 million barrels during the second quarter. And we've also said that, with a certain lag, the large cuts in E&P investments are going to show up in the supply numbers. And we see it in particular in non-NAM and OPEC, which has showed a gradual weakening over the first six months of this year. U.S. monthly sequential production is flattening and the core OPEC spare capacity was also down to only 2.3 million barrels in June, a million barrels per day. So I think the tightening that we've been foreshadowing, we are still relatively confident that that will happen in the second half of the year.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, good. On the environment, as you highlighted, pricing is still tough. I mean, we're at the trough. But clearly, the trough means, probably, average pricing still rolling down. And how do you see the say, some of the second half pricing and macro headwinds relative to the momentum that you have created within the organization? It's very clear from what you're delivering here that some of the initiatives that you initiated, maybe a year ago are really starting to deliver. But how much more can we expect given what you're already doing?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, I mean, you're asking whether our results are sustainable, I guess, right? So I mean, if...", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah, I mean, the headwinds relative to the internal momentum, how should we think about it?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, if we take the pricing part of the question first, I would agree with you that there is going to be a further impact on pricing in the second half of the year. We haven't seen the full impact of that. But I would say that there is probably still more relative impact in North America than what it is in the international markets. There is going to be impact in both regions in Q3 beyond where we are in Q2, but I think that's relatively larger in North America.", "As to our ability to offset this, the transformation and the general way that we are managing the company and the focus we have on cost and resource management, through this, we are going to continue to create a financial leverage over the coming years. And we are going to take that leverage out in two forms. We will take it out through market share gains by being able to be even more competitive on price. And secondly, we'll take the other part out through very strong incrementals when we grow. Or, alternatively, very strong decrementals when we shrink.", "So what we talked about in 2014 at the Investor Day in terms of what the transformation represents for the company, say, in the next five-year horizon, it is there. We are accelerating the impact from it. And we see this leverage as something that we will continuously take out in the coming years. So fundamentally, I think the performance that we are posting is sustainable. It's not going to be a straight line. But overall, what we are doing now is not a fluke.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, very impressive. Thank you very much. And Simon, congratulations with the free cash conversion. I'll hand it back.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Good morning.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "How do you see the performance-based work evolving in the U.S.? I know you've won projects internationally in the quarter in your SPM work in Ecuador and other places, internationally. But can you talk about the issues with growing that business model in the U.S.?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "That's a good question. So I think, I would mention two specific things here. I think, firstly, what is very positive at this stage is that customers are, more and more, starting to buy in to the fact that we have technologies and workflows that can create more value. That is what we've been investing in for the past five years and that is how we wanted to try to create technical differentiation in the largely commoditized North American market. So with the dialogues we have with customers, both on geoengineering completions, on refracturing, in terms of more sophisticated fracturing fluid systems like broadband, it is very clear that the appetites to use new technology and more sophisticated technology is growing.", "Now, some of the customers would take on that technology on a more of a standard type of contract, where we will still get a premium over what basic commodity type of technologies we'll give, while other customers will also like to go into a more risk-based contract setup. We are fine either way. We are looking to create technology differentiation, and I'm very optimistic about our ability to continue to push that forward in the coming quarters, even in this business environment.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, if I could, there has been a great deal made about the slowdown in deepwater project development, FID delays and major oil companies moving to onshore. Yesterday, we saw Conoco break a contract on almost a new rig. Can you talk about what Schlumberger sees in terms of the progress in deepwater development and how that's changed what you expect to see going forward, if you would, whatever, over the next couple of years?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, the immediate thing we see is, obviously, an impact on deepwater drilling activity. And this is largely focused in on the exploration side of deepwater. And that's a, it's a pretty significant reduction in that. Now, that is already incorporated or absorbed in our results where they stand today.", "In terms of the deepwater projects, I think, yes, there are some projects that are being delayed and some projects being canceled, if possible, but I think in general, these are long-term investments, many of them are already deeply committed. So we don't see any kind of dramatic impact at this stage on the projects that are in the pipeline. Now, going forward, in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it's going to be very important for the industry to be able to \u2013 the service industry together with our customers to be able to come up with technical solutions and field development plans that significantly reduces cost per barrel. And if we can do that, which is the overall objective for the industry, I think we can make many of the pending deepwater projects also economically viable in the future.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay gentleman. Thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you Jim.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks guys. I echo, certainly a good quarter, particularly with the decremental margins. So Paal, can you talk a little bit more about the decrementals? Obviously strong in North America and international, but specific to North America, can you talk about at least for the Q2 the impact of the transformation efforts versus new technology versus the head count? And also, are you seeing better uptakes from the new technologies this cycle than in prior downturns?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Yes. I think, basically, all the elements that you listed are the contributing factors to the lower decrementals. So obviously, we have a clean quarter this quarter. There are no charges in it, so this is basically straight-line business performance in the second quarter. And like you said, the overall impact on transformation, which we started several years earlier in North America, is part of driving this. We started our transformation and reorganization back in 2010.", "I would say our North American organization has also been very proactive when it comes to cost and resource management. And as we just talked about earlier on one of the questions there, the uptake of new technology, both in North America and international, the rate of uptake, given the downturn, is actually quite strong and actually much higher than what we have seen in any previous downturns. So I think that comes down to the fact that a lot of the technologies \u2013 new technology we now have out have very clear cost and efficiency angles to them, which means that they sell equally easy in the downturn as they do in the upturn.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the clarity. And then, you referenced it briefly in your remarks regarding the international outlook for 2016, which is, obviously, very preliminary, but based on your recent conversations and thinking through your viewpoints on supply/demand for crude, if we are in a $65 Brent world, what would your preliminary thoughts or color be on E&P CapEx on the international markets and do you have any color on the region?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, I think it's too early to make any firm predictions on E&P CapEx investments internationally next year. I would just say that we are relatively confident in the tightening of the supply/demand balance of the second half of the year. That would, under normal circumstances, lead to some uptick in the oil price. And if we see some improvement in the oil price in the second half of this year, I don't think there is going to be any huge impact on the current year budget, but I think it's a positive indicator that we might have some increase next year. I don't think the increase in 2016 is going to be large, but I think there is a good chance that E&P investment levels next year will be higher than what we've seen in 2015.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. I'll turn it over.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to David Anderson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. Paal, I just want to ask about Iran. Obviously, assuming there is an Iran deal goes through, I just wanted to know if you could highlight a little bit of Schlumberger's service opportunities that opens up over the next few years. And would you expect IOCs to start moving aggressively in there?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, I think what the IOCs are going to do, I think, you are going to have to ask them. I don't know. Our position and our view on Iran is the following: we have fully exited Iran. When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in. So beyond that, I don't really have anything more to say about what we will do, but it's coming down to, firstly, that the sanction needs to be officially lifted, which they are not yet done.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then, as a quick follow-up on the offshore. Can I get a little bit more detail? You've talked a few times about exploration spending coming down. I was just wondering if you can just help me understand how you see this exploration cycle playing out, say over the next 12 months. Do you think exploration can bottom by the fourth quarter? And then, at these costs, you talked about risk reduction in some of these contracts, do you think you could start seeing some sort of impact, some sort of turnaround in there by mid-2016, or something along those lines?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "I would say, potentially. We see the exploration spend down potentially around 30% again this year. That's including seismic, probably around the same level. So that is obviously a dramatic reduction if you look at what we already saw in 2014, right? So yes, we might not be too far away from bottom on exploration spend. But again, I don't see any dramatic turnaround immediately. We could potentially start seeing something towards the second half of 2016, if there is a kind of a gradual uptick of the oil price to at least plus/minus $70. But nothing on the horizon, as we see today. It's still a very tough market. And we see this very, very clearly in some of our key high tech product lines, where our exploration revenue over the past six quarters has actually dropped by 35%.", "So I don't think we are too far away from bottom because there's not that much left to cut. But the comeback I think is still a little bit out in time. But if you look at the level of spend today versus what is required for the industry to replace reserves and to find new oil field developments, we are obviously way under-investing. So this is not a sustainable situation. So the uptick will have to come. It's just that we don't see it on the immediate horizon.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great, thanks.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI", "Hey. Good morning Paal, or good afternoon, I guess, Paal, and congratulations on a well executed quarter. I had a question really related to the technology and technology uptake. It seems like this cycle is somewhat different than we've seen in previous cycles, where the technology uptake is actually greater. Last year, I think 27% of your revenues were from new technologies. Do you have a sense of \u2013 can you give us a number of what in terms of revenues, you're seeing in terms of new technology today, or maybe the first half of this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Yeah, so what we've seen so far this year, in terms of new technology as a percentage of our total technologies or the total revenue, is 22%. Now, this is slightly lower than the 25% target that we laid out last year. But given where we are in the cycle, this is dramatically higher than what we have seen in any previous cycle, right?", "So yes, we are selling a significantly higher rate of new technology in this part of the cycle versus previous. And as I said earlier, this is down to, I think, the fact that we have a very flush new technology portfolio and offering, and I think we have been doing a better job in clearly demonstrating to our customers what these new technologies bring, in terms of lower cost per barrel, in terms of efficiency, in terms of higher production. And this is, again, why I think the uptake, although it's slightly down from where it was in the second half of 2014, it is still holding up very, very well.", "James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI", "Okay, thanks. And then kind of an unrelated follow-up here. On the third quarter in particular, clearly, we are going to see continued declines in revenue internationally and probably some margin degradation. In North America, do you still expect to see a significant revenue degradation and marked degradation as well? Could you give us some clarity on kind of how we should think about 3Q, and is 3Q the bottom?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Okay, well, let's start up with the beginning. So in terms of revenue, we expect that the sequential drop is going to slow in Q3, and it could potentially represent bottom when it comes to revenue. Now, if you look at Q1, we saw a 19% sequential decline, in Q2, we saw a 12% sequential decline in revenue. So for the third quarter, we expect something in the range of 5%, 6% further decline in sequential revenue.", "James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI", "Okay.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Now, if you look at the two main parts of the world, in North America, we do expect a slight increase on activity on land. But again, we see this being offset by weakening also offshore activity and further pricing pressure, both on land and offshore and internationally no major change. We think the overall weak activity is going to continue and also there's going to be sustained pricing pressure. In addition, we have the slowing down of activity for part of Q3 in the Middle East and also the maintenance fees in the North Sea.", "Now, if you look at this cycle, so far we have proactively managed costs to protect margins. And I think we demonstrated that we are pretty quick on our feet and we can manage this very, very well. At this stage, our structure cost and our field capacity is really tailored to our Q2 activity level. But for now, we have decided to preserve our current structure for Q3, and this is in order to be ready for increased activity as we go forward.", "So provided this is for a limited period of time, we are prepared to live with the temporary margin impact that carrying these slightly elevated levels of resources is going to have. It's not going to be a huge impact on margins, but it's going to be a little bit more than what we could have managed if we were to cut even deeper. So if you look at EPS, it's going to come down in Q3, and I think the current consensus of $0.77 is a pretty realistic number.", "James Carlyle West - Evercore ISI", "Okay, perfect. Thanks, Paal.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Good morning. Going back to an earlier question, but I wanted to be more specific with regard to discussing the attempt at improved alignment with customers. Looking at three buckets, if you could talk specifically about refracking in terms of uptake, number of projects wins, what have you, engineering completions in the similar vein? And also on the deepwater front, getting more aligned and paid on the AFE versus NPT?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Okay, so if we start off with the land part, right? So on geoengineering completions in North America, we have over the past quarter engaged and are in contract \u2013 either we have signed contracts or either in contract discussions with several customers \u2013 on doing consistently geoengineering completions for them. And with refracturing, we are already engaged with eight different customers in North America land on doing refracturing for them. So both of these elements are picking up nicely. As I said earlier, some of the customers would like to go with traditional contracts where they just pay us a technology premium for what we bring, and others are still considering whether to go into a performance-based setup. And either way, we are fine. The main thing, as I said, we are looking to create technology differentiation. And again, this is going quite well.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "If there is any resistance to your underwriting the cost of a refrac or an engineering completions, what is it exactly? What would be the resistance on the part of a customer from actually allowing you to do that?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, I think the only resistance will be the fact that when they see that we are prepared to do it, it must be a pretty good business proposition. And I think when they look at this in more detail, they'll figure out that there is no need for us to carry the cost because they happily will carry the cost because it's a good investment. So I think that's really the main \u2013 so there is no resistance. It's just a reflection of, do they want to capture more of the value themselves or would they like to outsource all the risk and potentially much more of the upside to us?", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "And at this juncture with regard to the uptake on the land front, is it an even split between standard contracts and more of the underwritten contracts?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "I think at this stage, I would say it is probably more so standard contracts with the pricing premium rather than having to underwrite it. We offer underwriting to all of them but most of them actually do take more of a standard type of contract.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. And any comments on the deepwater front?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, in terms of changing the business model on deepwater and being, I would say, more compensated on performance rather than standard type of contracts, it is not that much movement on that front. We are discussing with some of our larger customers various types of framework. We haven't concluded any of these yet, but I would say there have been good kind of productive discussions. It takes a bit more time. These are larger projects. It's a bit more complicated to do than kind of the single well things we can do on land. But I would say we have good discussions and a good dialogue, and I think there is openness from our customers to invite us to the table and basically have us participate more, but nothing really material in terms of new contracts signed yet.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. And last one for me, your final sort of comment or one of them with regard to your opening narrative was referencing your balance sheet strength and your free cash flow generation, thus allowing you to take increased advantage of market opportunities. Can you elaborate on that? I assume in part that means acquisitions?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Simon, you want to comment on our use of free cash flow?", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "You know our priority to cash is still as we always declared. We will fuel the growth of the business and you've seen a slowdown on the CapEx because of times. But obviously, we continue to invest in SPM and multiclient. As far as acquisition, we do small ones on regular basis, and this is also funded through cash. We don't borrow for that kind of acquisition, but we will remain to be opportunistic on that front. But as I said, smaller acquisition that regular as far as to our use of cash.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, good morning. I guess good afternoon where you guys are. Congratulations on a very well executed run, Paal, over the last 12 months.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you very much.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Welcome. You indicated here that you're carrying a cost structure that is sized for kind of second quarter activity and willing to kind of deal with some near-term margin dynamics related with that cost structure if activity comes in a little bit more. I don't want to be too presumptuous, but then I would assume that you wouldn't want to sit for too much longer than one quarter with some sort of a margin drag. So can we maybe infer from your comments you're expecting a increase in activity, generally speaking, in the fourth quarter, that would be for North America, and then maybe international as soon as the first quarter of next year?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Yeah, I think you can read into this that \u2013 firstly, I think, we are pleased with how we've handled the downturn so far. We decided to be rather decisive in rightsizing the workforce for the downturn we are facing, and that includes both rightsizing and streamlining the support structure as well as the field capacity. So I think what you can read into the comments on the fact that we are prepared to carry slightly more costs into Q3, and this is not a significant part, it's slightly more, that is that we are indeed looking to be ready for growth in activity.", "Now, I can't say 100% certain that it's going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we're saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom. We believe that we have demonstrated very clearly our ability to manage cost and resources, and in the event the upturn is a couple of quarters away, we are prepared to carry the cost, and I think that would be a much better management of our resources to enable us to be well prepared and positioned for the growth, and in the event it's pushed out a bit more, we can also do further adjustments, that's relatively easy. We have shown that we can do it. So yes, you can infer that we are looking and searching for the uptick and that we think that we are pretty close to bottom.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. That's great color. I appreciate that. Now, in the context of the margin performance in the international markets for the second quarter and we roll through into the third quarter, how can \u2013 like if I look from the outside in, I would have to say to myself, if you did so well in the second quarter, I assume you can do probably equally as well in the third quarter, right, because you're sized for it, you've been positioned for it. So why would margins come down internationally in the third quarter versus the second quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, I can't say that they would or they wouldn't. I mean, obviously we would still like to maintain them where they are. We will internationally as well carry, I would say, slightly more resources than what is necessary for the third quarter. We see revenue coming down still a little bit from the second quarter level, and we could have shed some more resources to be prepared for that.", "I think the only reason why the margins would come down I would say, in general, would be that we are carrying slightly more resources. There is also a further pricing effect that comes into it. But obviously offsetting this is, is the continued impact from transformation, right? So I would say if we decided to go forward and completely align resources to activity, we should be able to absorb a large part of the pricing. I think the way we are going now, you could potentially see a little bit of margin drop in Q3, but that will be more by design. The fact that we are willing to carry a bit more resources, rather than not being able to effectively maintain it.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right, that's great. And if I just \u2013 just on the pricing front, on the international dynamics, what area are you seeing the most pricing in terms of geographic and what product lines are coming under the most pressure right now?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "In the international market?", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, obviously, the product line that has been the most effective so far is WesternGeco on the seismic side, which has been now going on for a good, about, six-odd quarters, right? So I think our team in WesternGeco has done a tremendous job in streamlining the cost structure, improving how we operate our fleets. So we are very well positioned to kind of maximize our performance on the marine seismic business the way it is today. But that's probably where we have seen the most.", "In terms of geography, you see it more or less everywhere, both on land and offshore, actually. But we've seen it in some of the large markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, the North Sea, even on land in the Middle East we have a significant pricing pressures, so we are navigating the landscape and we are \u2013 we have to give concessions, but we try to trade the concessions for something in return, either better terms and conditions, more integration opportunities, higher market share. And whatever is left to be offset, we are trying to offset with the leverage we are creating from the transformation.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, that's great, Paal. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Jim Crandell with Cowen. Please go ahead.", "Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning Paal. What impact is the pending merger of Halliburton and Baker Hughes having on the awarding of business outside of North America?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "It's a bit difficult for me to say what the impact is. I mean that's more of a customer question, right? I think it obviously creates a bit of uncertainty from our customers. Firstly, is the transaction going to go through? If it goes through then it's from three to two players. If it doesn't go through, then obviously that warrants a different approach to how they potentially would like to award. So I think it creates uncertainty from the customer side as to how they go about awarding in tender situation, and it has probably also led to potentially slightly lower rate of tendering in this part of the cycle. This is the ideal time for most of our customers to tender given the fact that they know activity is down. So I think it's \u2013 that is probably one impact that it has.", "If you look at our performance, I'm actually very pleased with our tender win rate in the first half of the year. I think we have done very well. I'm pleased with some of the key wins that we have taken on, and for me that should bode well, I think, for market share evolution in the second half of this year and into 2016.", "Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And do you think you've won market share year-to-date internationally in the areas that you compete with Halliburton and Baker?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Yeah, there is nothing in our revenue numbers in H1 as of yet, but if you look at the amount of contract volume we have won, I believe we have won a higher share of the contracts out for bid than what our current market share is, which means that over time, we should gain share.", "Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, good.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "As these contracts are implemented, yeah.", "Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, good. And as a follow-up question, I have on the U.S. pressure pumping business, in this kind of environment that we're in today, are there many instances where customers are willing to differentiate and pay for technology?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Well, if you look at the total business volume in North America land, it is not a high percentage yet. But I would say it's a growing number of customers that are willing to have a much more open technology discussion with us. And they see the importance, I think, of moving away focus entirely from driving down the well costs to driving down the cost per barrel for the production that they have. And the only way to do that now going forward as we are nearing the assumed total of how cheaply you can drill and complete these wells you're going to have to get more production out of them. And I think it's very evident that the only way to get that done is through new technology and new workload.", "Jim D. Crandell - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Becker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Paal, maybe sticking with the pressure pumping topic. You highlighted unsustainability of where that business stands right now. How do you expect this to play out? Does the capacity simply shift to stronger hands, or do you see some meaningful capacity reductions?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "No, I think what you find in any of these commoditized markets, if companies go under, there might be a temporary impact on capacity, as the capacity shifts hands. But most likely, whatever capacity is in the market today will likely resurface with some other ownership, once those type of transactions are sorted out, right? So I don't think it's going to be a permanent capacity reduction from companies potentially going under. I think these assets will shift hands and resurface with different ownership.", "Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That makes sense. Then maybe a quick one for Simon. In the past, you've mentioned getting payback on severance costs within a year. Is that on track, and does this simplistically mean cost savings of something around $750 million in 2015? And I'm just arriving at that number by summing up the severance costs from fourth quarter to second quarter.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So it is on track. It is, as we confirm, within one year. I'm not too sure about your number, but your logic is correct. If you take what we have declared, as far as the payments are concerned, this will be recovered less than a year.", "Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And are the remaining head count reductions more concentrated in North America or internationally?", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "We are almost completed with what we have done. There is no more reduction.", "Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Has that skewed more North America or internationally?", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, North America was a \u2013 percentage-wise was higher, but it was global, yes. Global.", "Douglas L. Becker - Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that will be our last question. I'll turn it back to the presenters for any closing remarks.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman and CEO", "All right, thank you. So before we close, I would like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed this morning. First, the market evolution in the second quarter was the continuation of what we saw in the first quarter, with North America land rig count falling further and with pricing pressure increasing in both North America and international markets. In response to this, we have proactively managed what remains under our control and subsequently delivered our best cost and cash performance so far in any downturn.", "Second, our strong performance has been amplified by the acceleration of our transformation program, which is being actively implemented throughout our global organization, and which has enabled us to increase pre-tax operating margins in the international areas and maintain double-digit margins in North America.", "Third, we believe that we now have seen the bottom of the rig count decline in North America and that North America land activity will see a slow increase in the second half of this year, while service pricing is expected to decline further in the third quarter as the fight for market share continues to play out.", "In the international markets, we expect no upward revision to E&P CapEx spend for remainder of 2015, as the trend of low exploration activity, tight management of development spend, and sustained pricing pressure is likely set to continue. Based on this, the third quarter could potentially represent the bottom of the cycle in terms of earnings per share, as the pace of the revenue drop is set to slow and as we continue our steadfast efforts to maximize operating margins in both North America and international markets. And with the streamlining of our cost and resource base undertaken in the past nine months, together with the acceleration of our transformation program, we remain very optimistic about our ability to deliver unmatched incremental margins as soon as E&P investments start to show any signs of growth.", "That concludes today's call. Thank you very much for attending.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference is available for replay. It starts today at 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statement we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the projected statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.", "Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "Now, I will turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share were $0.78. This represent decreases of $0.10 sequentially and $0.71 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our third quarter revenue of $8.5 billion decreased 6% sequentially. Almost 40% of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. ", "Despite the very challenging environment both in terms of pricing and activity, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 101 basis points sequentially. This was due to the continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization. Sequential highlights by product group whereas follows. Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 5% sequentially as decreases in exploration spending impacted both wireline and testing services internationally. Despite the revenue decline, pre-tax margin -- operating margins remained essentially flat at 26.3%. Drilling Group revenue of $3.3 billion, decreased 7%, primarily due to pricing pressures and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected drilling and measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 94 basis points to 18.6%. Production Group revenue of $3 billion, decreased 5% sequentially, while margins declined 173 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by pricing and activity declines in Well Services.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate was 20% in the third quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 1 percentage point due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the Rest of the World as well as the mix of earnings amongst the international geo markets. Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During the third quarter, we generated $2.5 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of 2015, we have generated $6.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $150 million during the third quarter and $600 million during the first nine month of the year. ", "Net debt improved $400 million during the quarter to $5.2 billion. During the quarter, we spend $545 million to repurchase 6.9 million shares at an average price of $78.76. Subsequent to the announcement of our transaction with Cameron in August, we have been repurchasing the maximum number of shares allowable under the SEC\u2019s regulations.", "We filed our S4 registration statement relating to the acquisition two weeks ago today. It\u2019s worth highlighting that once the SEC declares our registration statement effective and the proxy statement is mailed. We will be prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our stock until the Cameron shareholder vote. We spent $590 million on Capex during the third quarter. Full-year 2015 Capex excluding multi-client and SPM investments is still expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you Simon and good morning everyone. Schlumberger third quarter revenues fell 6% sequentially, driven by continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations. North America revenues fell 4% sequentially, as we maintain focus on balancing margins and market share, while international revenue was 7% lower as customer budget cuts and service pricing erosion impacted results. Still in the midst of what may well turn out to be the most severe downturn in several decades, our operating margins were maintained at levels much higher than in previous downturns. ", "In North America, pre-tax operating margins were held at 8.9% in spite of an additional drop in activity and pricing both offshore and on land. While international margins dropped to 23.7% as customer budget cuts, activity cancellations and lower service pricing took further effect. In the first nine months of 2015, year-over-year revenue has dropped 34% in North America and 18% internationally, yet we have delivered nine month decremental operating margins of 34% in North America and 23% internationally, which represents a strong performance improvement over the 2009 downturn.", "We have delivered these results by proactively and decisively managing our cost and resource base, carefully navigating the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share and at the same time, accelerating our internal transformation program. We also generated more than $1.7 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter, which represents a conversion rate of 170% of the quarter\u2019s earnings.", "Our ability to generate significant free cash flow even in this part of the cycle is a major competitive edge which we actively use to pursue new business opportunities as well as targeted M&A activity. In terms of M&A, our main focus in recent months has been the proposed acquisition of Cameron announced on August 26, which will open up a significant growth opportunity for us, as we look to establish the industry\u2019s first complete drilling and production systems, spanning both the surface and the subsurface.", "In addition, we also completed the acquisition of Houston-based T&T Engineering, which specializes in design of land rig systems as well as Utah-based Novatek, which is a leader in the field of synthetic diamond innovation. We also signed a letter of intent for a joint venture with a part of the Bauer Group from Germany in further revolution of our land-rig-of-the-future strategy. And finally, we entered into an agreement with IBM to jointly provide integrated production optimization services combining our production software platform with IBM\u2019s enterprise asset management services in an end-to-end offering.", "Looking at our results on a geographical basis, North American revenue decreased 4% sequentially, a figure considerably less than the 27% sequential decrease seen in the second quarter and better than the 7% drop in the average horizontal rig count. On land, the revenue growth was driven by lower hydraulic fracturing activity and additional pricing pressure for both products and services. In the Gulf of Mexico, revenue declined on lower multiclient seismic sales, exploration rigs transferring to drilling and completion activities, as well as pricing concessions which were partially offset by higher new technology sales.", "In Western Canada, rig count almost doubled sequentially, following the early spring break up, but was still down by roughly 52% year-over-year. In spite of these headwinds, operating margins in North America decreased by only 136 basis points sequentially to 8.9% and this strong performance is the direct results of our proactive approach to cost and resource management, the growing effects of our transformation program, strong new technology sales and efficient supply chain management.", "As service pricing in US land fell further in the third quarter, we continued our approach of concentrating activity in core areas and for key customers while proceeding to start equipment rather than operating at a loss. In the rare event, we select to pursue work at what we consider non-commercial prices. We view this as an investment decision and apply the same justification and approval process used for any other reinvestment we do in our business. This has let us to move equipment and crews between basins as we look to balance market share with margins and as we pursue new technology opportunities. We believe that this approach has enabled us to protect our profitability in North America land and has also helped us maintain our overall infrastructure and long-term ability to service our customers in this market.", "In the international markets, revenue declined 7% sequentially due to further customer budget cuts, rapidly changing activity driven by the disruptions, delays and cancellations, as well as by further pricing concessions. Third quarter international operating margins of 23.7% was down 72 basis points sequentially and 83% basis points year-over-year. Our nine month decremental margins were still held to 23% which represents a marked improvement over the 61% from the corresponding period in the 2009 downturn which is a testament to both the strength of our international business and how well our organization is executing.", "Within the international areas, Middle East and Asia revenues declined by 8% sequentially while pretax operating margins decreased 171 basis points to 27%. Activity in the Middle East remained robust during the quarter, particularly in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, but pricing concessions, changes to the activity mix, as well as project delays had a negative impact on revenue and profitability. Year-over-year area revenue decreased 20% while margins dropped by 61 basis points. Our lump sum turnkey project in Saudi Arabia continued to progress well and with steady improvements in drilling efficiency, well deliveries are now ahead of planned levels. ", "In the United Arab Emirates, robust drilling production and seismic activity was boosted by further rig additions and we also recorded strong sales of Petrel and ECLIPSE software. Drilling activity was also stronger in Kuwait as rig count increased, however, this was partly offset by operational delays and an activity shutdown in the neutral zone. ", "In Iraq, we mobilized two rigs for the Zubair lump sum turnkey project with the first well already completed, while revenue from the other operations in the country remained flat with the second quarter. ", "In Southeast Asia, activity was lower throughout the region driven by a further drop in Offshore Australia as project ended, lower rig count in Malaysia, reduced deep-water exploration and development work in the South China Sea and continuing NOC budget cuts on land in China. ", "In Latin America, revenue declined 7% sequentially, while pretax operating margins fell 159 basis points to 20.7%. In Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, activity was further hit by a combination of delays and budget reductions, while Colombia was weaker due to increased pricing pressure. These effects were however, partially offset by steady activity in Venezuela and Ecuador. ", "Year-over-year area revenue decreased 30% and operating margins decreased by 120 basis points. In Mexico, revenue dropped again in the third quarter and now stands at an eight-year low as the significant budget cuts further impacted activity and profitability. At the same time, we began multiclient seismic operations in the Gulf of Campeche and awards for the second and third license rounds of the Energy Reform Act remain on schedule. ", "Offshore activity continued to decline in Brazil as budget reductions impacted both equipment rentals and field operations. And in addition to this, revenue was also hit by the weakening of the reais. In Venezuela, activity was steady for both the PDVSA and for the heavy-oil joint ventures in the Faja, while in Ecuador, SPM activity was flat as the Shushufindi project continued to perform in line with expectations. ", "In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell 6% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins increased 92 basis points to 22.2%. Year-over-year revenue decreased 31% and margins dropped by 125 basis points. Within the area, the bright spot in the third quarter was Russia and Central Asia, where revenue continued to increase with peak summer drilling activity in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This increase was however partially offset by a weaker ruble. ", "In the North Sea, increased drilling in the UK sector was insufficient to counter lower activity in the remote areas and was further offset by reduced activity in Norway from project delays and cancellations as well as currency weakness. ", "In Sub-Saharan Africa, activity increased in Gabon in the third quarter, but was considerably lower in the rest of the region as operations were halted in Chad. Exploration work dropped to a new low in Angola and also projects were cancelled in Nigeria. In Algeria and Tunisia, activity was also down in the third quarter, while in Libya, our operations continues to be limited to one offshore rig. ", "Turning next to the overall market outlook, we see two clear trend emerging. First, as we enter the last quarter of the year, the global oil market is still weighed down by fears of reduced growth in China, and the timing and magnitude of additional Iranian exports. However, the fundamental balance of supply and demand continues to tighten driven by both solid global GDP growth and by weakening supply as dramatic cuts in E&P investments start to take full effect. We expect this trend to continue and as the oil markets further recognizes the magnitude of the industry\u2019s annual production replacement challenge, this will gradually translate into improvements in oil prices going forward. ", "Second, in spite of the expected improvements in oil prices, the market outlook for oilfield services looks challenging for the coming quarters, as we expect additional reductions in activity and further pressure on service pricing.", "This is driven by the financial pressure on many of our customers where a year of very low oil prices is now exhausting available cash flow and corresponding capital spending and also leading them to take a very conservative view on 2016 E&P budgets. In addition to this, the winter season will have the normal negative impact on activity, which in the fourth quarter, is unlikely to be offset by the usual year-end sales of software products and multi-client licenses.", "Based on this industry outlook, we expect E&P investments to fall for a second successive year in 2016, which is the first time since the 1986 downturn, when the spare capacity cushion was more than 10 million barrels per day. In spite of the need for the industry to increase investment levels to mitigate the pending impact on global supply, we instead see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between the expected improvement in oil prices and the subsequent increase in E&P investments and oilfield services activity.", "This timing gap or increased response time is a direct consequence of the dramatic cost in E&P investments, which have clearly damaged the oil industry\u2019s financial strength and investment appetite as well as the operating capacity and capability. So while our macro view has not changed in terms of a tightening supply and demand balance and an expected improvement in oil prices, we have to factor in that the likely recovery in our activity levels now seems to be a 2017 event.", "We communicated in our previous earnings call that we were prepared to live with our existing cost base going forward, provided we were close to the bottom of the market and that the activity recovery was only a couple of quarters out. As a result, we carried our cost base forward into Q3, which had some negative impact on our operating margins and we did not report any exceptional restructuring charges in the quarter.", "The likely timing gap between the oil price recovery and the subsequent increase in oilfield services activity in combination with a more conservative spending outlook from our customers is causing us to now take further action. We have therefore decided to proceed with a further round of capacity and overhead reductions, which will result in a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.", "This charge will cover severance cost for additional headcount reductions, reflecting both our updated activity outlook for 2016 and a further streamlining of our support structure. In addition and as part of our internal transformation program, we are now ready to initiate a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will also result in a charge in the fourth quarter.", "We will seize opportunities to streamline our engineering, manufacturing and sustaining infrastructure by consolidating sites into clusters both in central locations and in the field, while at the same time, further modernize our processes by introducing state of the art manufacturing automation in line with the best companies in other high tech industries.", "These changes to our manufacturing and distribution network are closely coordinated with the integrated plans for Cameron, which are already well advanced and which will be quickly implemented once the transaction has closed. So far in this downturn, we have proactively and decisively managed our cost and resource base, carefully navigated the commercial landscape with the aim of balancing margins and market share, at the same time, as we have actively accelerated our internal transformation program.", "With the above actions, we are continuing this prudent approach with the aim of protecting and extending our solid financial performance into 2016, which is shaping up to be another challenging year for the oilfield services industry. We further believe that our ability to respond to higher E&P investments and oilfield activity in 2017 will be improved by protecting our financial strength in 2016, rather than carrying at accepted costs and inefficiencies as we await the recovery of the oilfield services market.", "Overall, we remain very confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings and through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and our transformation program, we are creating a significant financial leverage that will enable us to increase market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow.", "Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ole Slorer at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer", "Well, thank you very much. And, Paal, I wonder whether we could start with the macro and maybe before that, Simon congrats with another great set of free cash flow numbers.", "Simon Ayat", "Thanks, Ole.", "Ole Slorer", "But let us start with the macro for now. Where do you think that the weakening supply has played our differently or similarly to what you would have thought 3, 6 or 12 months ago in light of recent CapEx cuts?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think it\u2019s playing out more or less as we have expected globally. I think what you see in OPEC, there is really no change to overall production capacity. There is a continuous shift from spare capacity into marketed supply. In North America, the production is coming down more or less as expected as well and internationally, we are starting to see signs of a weakening supply as well. I think in all these three main sources of supply, while production is starting to come down, I think there are also significant efforts to maximize production within each of these basis while in some cases taking more short-term actions to maximize production which might actually have a negative on long-term recovery. I think there is only a limited period that this can be done and while the various players exhaust these type of opportunities, if investments aren\u2019t increased, I think you will see a further acceleration of the drop in production.", "Ole Slorer", "And the timing of that acceleration, do you have a view on that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, it\u2019s still a bit difficult to say, but I think there are clear signs now in all \u2013 at least in North America and non-NAM and OPEC that production is weakening and we expect that to continue and potentially accelerate in the event the investments aren\u2019t increasing.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay, thanks for that. Just sort of based on what you highlight here, with respect to CapEx trends in respect of oil prices, just having a shot at your fourth quarter and first quarter next year, with a 10% EPS reduction into the fourth quarter and then another 5% into the first quarter, would that be a reasonable trajectory?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, let me say this. Q4 looks challenging and visibility had actually dropped in the past month or two now. So, formal [ph] activity is down, but in Q4 we will see the start of the wind to slow down in the northern hemisphere. We also see further budget cuts in several of the key offshore markets such as Sub-Sahara Africa, Brazil and the Far East. We also expect rig activity in North America land to be down in Q4 due to the financial stress on many of our customers there and we expect very limited yearend sales of product, software and multiclient. So EPS will drop, but due to the lack of the visibility we have now, Ole, I am not really ready to commit to a number, but I will also say that Q1 in spite of Q4 not having the seasonal uptick in yearend sales, we also see Q1 being below Q4.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks, Ole.", "Operator", "Thank you. We will go next to the line of James West with Evercore ISI.", "James West", "Hey, good morning Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning. ", "James West", "Paal, so we\u2019ve now pushed out the recovery to \u201917, but I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on how you see \u201816 playing out. Clearly you just mentioned 1Q is going to be below 4Q, does that mark the bottom in earnings and we are kind of going sideways from those next year or is there a potential for a second half modest upturn?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we hope that Q1 will represent the bottom and there would be a gradually, but slow recovery during the year or even sideways. I think it is still too early to say, James. I think we have, even for Q4 now there is significant uncertainties in several of the markets on what\u2019s going to happen. Beyond that we clearly see Q1 being below Q4, but visibility, Q1 is still very low. So I would hope that what you kind of depict will be the case, but I think it\u2019s too early to say. But I would say also that there is a limit to how long these reductions in investment and activity can continue. And I think as the oil price now likely will start to move upwards, hopefully investments will turnaround, but anything meaningful will be late \u201816 and into 117 as we see it as per today.", "James West", "Okay, got it. And then, Paal, you specifically called out M&A in the press release last night and you had a number of smaller deals in addition to Cameron this quarter, or last quarter excuse me. Are you preparing the market for something additional of size or is this just highlighting the fact that you guys are generating tons of cash, you got a huge flexibility?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah, it\u2019s still out there, we\u2019re not preparing the market for anything other than refocus significantly our entire organization on generating free cash. Margins are a key ingredients to generate cash. So both of those are key focus areas for us in terms of protecting and extending our strong financial performance. And obviously, in this type of market, companies that can generate significant free cash has a broad range of opportunities and I think we\u2019ve shown so far in the downturn that we will be opportunistic. What opportunities are there and which one we will convert, we will revert back to you when we have converted them. But as of now, we will continue to be opportunistic but there is no preparation or any methods beyond that.", "James West", "Okay, got it. Thanks Paal.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of Angie Sedita with UBS.", "Angie Sedita", "And again impressive free cash flow and decrementals there versus the peer group. So, Paal in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about the outlook for 2016 as far as E&P spending and I know it\u2019s obviously early to have much granularity. So, where we have less visibility is internationally and maybe you can just give us some color there on what you\u2019re hearing with your conversations, with your customers around the world as far as the spending outlook for 2016 both land and offshore?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah, we don\u2019t have a lot of granularity Angie; it\u2019s still just kind of broad-based statements. Most of our customers haven\u2019t completed or just barely started our budgeting process for 2016. But the general feedback is very consistent. And that is, they expect, the vast of them that spend will be lower. So I can\u2019t give you granularity of geography or land and offshore. I would say though that the part of that rule that is still very, very resilient is obviously the GCC countries in the Middle East. So I\u2019m not expecting anything significant there in terms of lower investments. But broad-based pretty much everywhere else. There are significant challenges and we expect 2016 budgets to be below 2015.", "Angie Sedita", "Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And if you -- you think about the U.S. and obviously it\u2019s a smaller market for you. But as you think about the U.S. and you\u2019ve said on a number of occasions that the pricing is unsustainably low. And as we all know that many of these smaller companies are free cash flow negative. I mean how do you think this plays out in 2016 going into 2017, could even a modest increase in activity in oil prices led to even modest improvements in pricing or how do you think this plays out, any thoughts?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah. I\u2019m not very optimistic on any turnaround in service and product pricing for oilfield services in North America land. I think, yes, many of the small companies or most of the small companies are free cash flow negative. They are under significant financial stress and maybe some of them will go bankrupt in the coming quarters or in the coming year. But there is still massive overcapacity and even these small companies that go bankrupt will likely be picked up other investors and their assets will be returned back into the market. So, I think the overcapacity is going to be with industry for quite a considerable amount of time. So I don\u2019t expect any real improvement in service and product pricing in the coming year in North America land.", "Angie Sedita", "All right, great. Thanks I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Company.", "Bill Herbert", "Wondering if we can talk about a little bit about the flexibility of the U.S. upstream value chain here as we\u2019re getting deeper into this downturn. And I mean the supposition has been and perhaps continues to be the -- once the recovery narrative is embraced by the industry that the industry can respond quickly and assertively to an increase in spending and activity. Do we still think that\u2019s the case given the duress of the industry and the fact that many are not only cutting into fat and muscle but now bone.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So I think the industry is -- so I think the market is probably overestimating how quickly the industry can respond whether it\u2019s in North America or internationally. I think the fact that now four quarters into very low oil prices, the financial strength of many of our customers has significantly weakened and their appetite to invest is also a bit down. Any I think \u2013 any improvement in oil prices, I think will be to initially \u2013 is going to go towards the strength in the balance sheet and then the oil companies will likely assess how sustainable are these increases in oil prices before they start investing. ", "So there is a delay, I believe, between an improvement in oil prices and the decision to increase budgets. And there is going to be a further delay between increasing budgets and realizing that into higher oil field activity. And then there is going to be a delay in between higher oil activity and higher production. So I think there \u2013 the market is underestimating how long this period is going to take and just the fact that the industry is again looking to reduce investments when we have this significant pending supply impact coming. This shows that I think we are \u2013 we even have increasing chance of a potential spike in oil prices if investments aren\u2019t increased in time. ", "Bill Herbert ", "Okay. And then secondly, so given the duress that you\u2019re processing here for the next several quarters, notwithstanding the fact your decrementals in Q3 were still very laudable, they trended higher. And I\u2019m just curious as to whether we see accelerating decrementals over the next quarters or do they stabilize or what\u2019s your view with regards to the roadmap on that front?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, in terms of our decrementals, we are working flat out to continue to manage them at our own levels that you\u2019ve seen so far this year. So we are not giving up on that, we have continuous efforts both in reducing cost and capacity as well as creating more leverage to offset pricing from our transformation. So we are going to continue to work very hard at delivering continuously very strong decrementals. We see that that\u2019s very important to sort of maintain our financial strength and also to help us generate the strong free cash flow that you\u2019ve seen so far this year. ", "Bill Herbert", "Okay, thank you. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of Jim Crandell at Cowen.", "Jim Crandell", "Good morning. Paal, the \u2013 based on maybe a more limited sample size, we seem to see a number of companies quarrelling for 20% to 30% reductions in their CapEx for 2016. Is that a range that you think is reasonable at this point? ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think, full year 2016 \u2013 for full year 2016, that sounds like a high number. At this stage, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be as much as that, no. ", "Jim Crandell", "And based on your conversations with the \u2013 with managements of some of the NOCs, would you think that the NOCs in Latin America, West Africa and Asia would be still one of the weakest points in the market. I noticed that Angola is cutting spending by 50% next year, and do you think that\u2019s going to be indicative of some of the NOCs in those regions?", "Simon Ayat", "Well, that number again I think is high, but I think the fact that this customer group has cut significantly this year and would likely go down potentially further next year, I think is a reasonable assumption. But again, my commentary on 2016 is based on very high level discussions and I don\u2019t have details of what budgets and what numbers are going to be. Other than that, it seems to be consensus that overall spend will be down. I think your 20% to 30% is very high. It\u2019s likely to be less than that, but still I expect it to be down. ", "Jim Crandell", "And how would you \u2013 in a declining market, how do you think that that affects the market share of integrated services for Schlumberger?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don\u2019t think it has a direct impact on anything in terms of up or down. There continues to be a broad range of integration type of opportunities. We are pursuing order, but it is all the way from bundle services from a few of our product lines all the way up to full turnkey lump sum contracts as well as SPM opportunities. So nothing dramatic in terms of shift of integration opportunities. It continues to be a key part of what they offer and there is a generally growing appetite from all customer groups to engage in those type of contracts. ", "Jim Crandell", "Good. Okay, thank you. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of Bill Sanchez at Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Bill Sanchez", "Thanks. Good morning, Paal. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning. ", "Bill Sanchez", "Paal, I want to try to understand a bit more from you the magnitude of the pricing declines internationally that you\u2019re seeing and what the duration from here is going to be and I guess specifically kind of where are we now or where are you I should say in working through all of your contract renegotiations with your customers?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I can\u2019t give you a number, Bill, on this, other than, I think, it\u2019s clear that the pricing impact internationally all the way, it is significant to our operations, it is still significantly lower than what we\u2019ve seen in North America and North America land. I would say that round one of the pricing discussion is complete. There might be more coming in the coming quarters and I think as long as oil prices are down, and the outlook is still relatively somber, then there is a constant pressure on pricing internationally as well as in North America land.", "So, we continue to work through that. We bid competitively on the tenders that are out there, customers that are looking to renegotiate, we engage in those discussions and obviously, we\u2019re trying to minimize and protect how we -- what we concede in these type of discussions, but that\u2019s a call we make in this situation around what market share we are looking at, what kind of terms and conditions we can get, so some of the things and how we look at the overall business that we run. This is a normal part of business. When there is overcapacity, there is pressure on pricing, and that\u2019s part of what we do for a living to manage that.", "Bill Sanchez", "Do past renegotiations that you\u2019ve, for the like of, kind of settled with your customers, do those get reopened here as we go into 2016 or these are just incremental discussions that you\u2019re still having on contracts that really haven\u2019t been negotiated at this point or renegotiated at this point?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think it\u2019s a mix of all of it that I think you see it in North America land and you see at international. Overcapacity, there is a continuous pricing discussion until we hit the bottom of the market and then it stabilizes and then we look upwards from there. So there is a mix of renegotiations of contracts already discussed and some of them, which have not been changed already. So there is a combination of all of that.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. Simon, a follow-up for you or a question for you, can you give us an idea of when the share repurchase blackout period will begin for you?", "Simon Ayat", "Okay. So as I mentioned in my remarks, once we supplied the S4 and it is accepted, there will be a blackout period. I am expecting it to be about four to five weeks and could start maybe early November.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. And I guess we would expect repurchases to take place up until that point?", "Simon Ayat", "Yeah. Now, I like to take this opportunity just to remind you that first, we are issuing a large number of shares and the number of shares that will be issued, it\u2019s going to take place by our US based subsidiary. You\u2019re going to see a large movement in the capital structure of Schlumberger between our US subsidiary and the parent company. In other words, the US subsidiary will be the one acquiring Cameron and as a result, it\u2019s going to acquire the shares from the parent company. ", "So you\u2019re going to see eventually when we close the transaction of Cameron, a large swing in the capital structure between the US based subsidiary, our parent company because of the structure of the acquisition and this would require the US subsidiary as I said to acquire shares from the parent company. So, there will be a large movement of cash from the US based subsidiary into the parent company. But when times will come, we\u2019ll explain it to you in more details and how it\u2019s going to work out.", "Bill Sanchez", "Great. I appreciate the time. I\u2019ll turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of David Anderson of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson", "Thanks. Paul, I was hoping you could expand a bit more on what you see on the exploration front. In the commentary, you noted Gulf of Mexico continue to transition. Now, West Africa is starting to roll those exploration programs. And what\u2019s the mindset of your customers at this point of where that fits in the portfolio, you talked about -- the first and foremost about the balance sheet is obviously about dividend, but is it just about getting development costs down first and this exploration is kind of pushed out, well, how does that kind of fit in terms of your vision for the next couple of years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah. I think what you\u2019re saying is correct. The focus on driving cost down is on development and exploration is basically eliminated. That\u2019s how I think many customers look at it. There are significant cuts in exploration activity and they continue both for seismic and for drilling. The Q3 exploration rig count was down about 25% year-over-year and the seismic spend was also down in excess of 30% and that\u2019s following a pretty low year in 2014 as well. So it is very challenging for exploration activity for us, but again the impact of this is still fully absorbed in our results which are still reasonably good. So, yes, in summary, our customers are more or less cutting completely exploration and focusing a lot more in driving further cost out of the development.", "David Anderson", "And on that side, on the development, as you integrate OneSubsea into Schlumberger, this will be a pretty big opportunity to pull on the rest of Schlumberger to help bring down development cost. If I think about you leaning on your reservoir expertise and well design capabilities, how receptive have customers been so far to Schlumberger taking a greater role in that offshore development. It would seem to be as a pretty big mindset change for your customers. I mean, is that happening? Do you feel confident of that? Do you think projects can actually move ahead in \u201916 because of that or is that a little too optimistic in terms of the timing? ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It might be slightly optimistic on the timing, but I think \u2013 so first of all, many of the things that you mention in terms of bringing together these capabilities of Schlumberger and OneSubsea is already happening, but obviously we can accelerate and have an even further impact on this as we close the transaction and take full management of OneSubsea, but I am very pleased with the progress that OneSubsea has made and the close working relationship we\u2019ve had OneSubsea from the Schlumberger side. But I think over time and maybe not already in 2016, there is significant cost reduction potential in the \u2013 for the deepwater, I think both, when it comes to the well cost as well as for the overall infrastructure.", "I think we can simplify, we can standardize, we can engineer costs out of the system and what that will allow, if you can, for instance, reduce the well cost by, say, 30%, you can potentially drill four wells for the price of three, which again will help you increase production and recovery from the deepwater fields which obviously will help lower cost of barrel and then improve the economics. So I think we are in very, very early innings in terms of driving down costs for deepwater, both production and then the drilling part of it. And I think what we are doing now with the Cameron acquisition is going to address both those dimensions.", "David Anderson", "Great. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We will go next to the line of Scott Gruber at Citi.", "Scott Gruber", "Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning. ", "Scott Gruber", "Turning back to international decrementals, you guys continue to post very impressive figures during this down cycle, but at what rate of upstream spending decline abroad with this 25%, 30% decrementals be at risk of rising? I know there is not a lot of clarity on exactly how spending will turn out next year, but spending is down 15%, would you start to become concerned or would it take a steeper drop to really threaten those decrementals?", "Simon Ayat", "You are talking about 2016 spending.", "Scott Gruber", "Correct.", "Simon Ayat", "Well, we have delivered I think very strong financial performance in the international market now for a number of years. In 2014, we generated 69% incrementals on quite limited revenue growth and so far 23% decrementals on 18% drop in revenue this year. So our performance so far this year is not a fluke, we have been very good at managing our international business. So I am expecting that even with still further headwinds in terms of top line in 2016, we should be able to continue to hold the decrementals at a very respectable level, whether they are going to be at 23% or slightly higher, it will be difficult to say. But in terms of offsetting activity reductions through cost cutting, I think we have proven that we can do that. And beyond that it is how much leverage we can generate from the transformation to offset pricing. So both of those are \u2013 we are very active on trying to delivery both of those type of results. And we are going to go very hard at it for 2016 to continue to delivery strong decrementals internationally.", "Scott Gruber", "Got it. And then you already touched on the need for customers to repair their balance sheets which will likely contribute to the delay in activity recovery. Is there also an oil price threshold that you have in mind that need to be achieved before your customers start to increase CapEx? I mean, do we need to see $65 Brent or $70 Brent. At what level do you think customers are comfortable expanding their budgets even if there is some delay?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I don\u2019t have a specific oil price number in mind. I think it\u2019s going to be much more functional how sustainable our customers see the increases in oil prices to be. I think it\u2019s more about having a stable basis for increasing investments before they go ahead and do it right. I still that they are -- that there is going to be conservatism based on the very tough four quarters that the industry has gone through at this stage. And that\u2019s why again we are basically saying that there is going to be a lag between higher oil prices and investments, and even a tag between our investments and realizable oil selectivity.", "Operator", "Anything further Mr. Gruber?", "Scott Gruber", "Well nope, that\u2019s it, got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim.", "Michael LaMotte", "If I could follow-up just on transformation quickly and ask you to expand upon two areas in particular. First you\u2019re comments on the reorganization of the manufacturing operations and how long that is expected to take and if you could quantify the gross margin benefit perhaps of that effort. And then secondly, in the press release, this is the first time we\u2019ve seen the references to the multiskilling. So if you could give us an update in terms of where we are in the progress of that effort as well?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah. On the transformation around the global manufacturing and distribution, the charge we\u2019re taking is for consolidating facilities, moving much more towards campuses and clusters and also the introduction of some new automation manufacturing type of technology. Similarly, we\u2019re also looking to consolidate how we do global distribution going more from a global and local set up to a much more regional setup in terms of how we manage that. So the process of getting it done, we are -- we have already embarked on. And there are some charges associated with it that we will take in the fourth quarter and we will continue implementing that program in 2016 and 2017. So, I\u2019m not going to be able to give you a specific impact on margins and what this is going to generate for us, although that we\u2019re -- we are very excited about doing this. It\u2019s going to modernize a core part of the company and its going to make us even more competitive in the international market.", "Now in terms of multiskilling, this is part of how we\u2019re continuing to drive people productivity. There is many other aspects of what we do there, we have remote operations as another key part of this as well, where we can centralize much more of our expertise and have them oversee more jobs centrally rather than being at the well side as well. So, all of these elements are key part of the transformation program and we are still not at the halfway point of rolling this out globally and for it to have the full impact on our operations on our results. So there is still a lot of runway left in both the multiskilling, the remote operations and what we\u2019re going to do on manufacturing and distribution as well as all the other parts of the transformation. So we\u2019re excited about it and there is a strong pull from the entire organization on this and we continue to work hard on implementing it.", "Michael LaMotte", "Great, thank you. And if I could ask a follow-up quickly to Simon. Would you be perhaps, I noticed debt came down; total debt came down in the third quarter from the second quarter. During the blackout would you be using free cash flow to further pay down debt or can we just assume that that cash builds on the balance sheet in that interim?", "Simon Ayat", "So, good question Michael. Some of the -- most of our debt actually is a fixed debt. So we do have certain percentage which is more reflective of commercial paper, et cetera, this will go down. But as I said earlier and I like to repeat this that you\u2019re going to see a large movement in our capital structure. And perhaps eventually, we will have a little bit more debt associated with the transaction coming from our North America or our U.S.-based subsidiary. And this to acquire the shares from the parent company. So you\u2019re going to see a different type of movement and eventually there will be larger debt that we will have in the U.S. subsidiary in order to acquire the shares.", "Michael LaMotte", "Post close?", "Simon Ayat", "In the meantime, during the blackout period, as you highlighted it would reflect into a reduction in the debt, which is the current debt that is reflected in the simple [ph] program that we issue on daily basis.", "Michael LaMotte", "Great, thanks Simon. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to the line Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo Securities. ", "Jud Bailey", "Thanks, good morning. Paal, I ask you about a couple of different markets outside of North America, it seems like Latin America continues to trend some of the more \u2013 one of the more difficult international markets. Could you maybe comment on Mexico and also, particularly on Brazil given all the issues going on the Petrobras and some of the contract renegotiations and how you\u2019re thinking about that market and how it may impact you in 2016? ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah, both markets, as you point out, both Mexico and Brazil have been very challenging this year. Mexico, even more than Brazil, I would say. So there has been significant budget reductions and they have continued throughout the year. Like I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our Q3 revenues now stands at an eight-year low, which is quite remarkable for a sizable market as Mexico is for us. ", "So in terms of next year, it\u2019s still very early for both of these countries, Mexico and Brazil, but I think it\u2019s going to be challenging as we enter into 2016. Though, I don\u2019t have a lot of details of it yet, but no positive signs either from Pemex or from Petrobras at this stage. ", "Jud Bailey", "Okay. Thank you. And I\u2019ll \u2013 my follow-up is on \u2013 just to circle back on international pricing, understanding you\u2019re kind of done with Round 1, but as you kind of look at the market today, is pricing getting \u2013 is it starting to decline worse than it did earlier in the year or is there any sign of it stabilizing or do you get the sense that the pricing is slipping even more? And are there any particular markets internationally, where you are seeing more pricing pressure than others? ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, it is not, I\u2019d say slipping further, it\u2019s just \u2013 there is a continuing pricing pressure in this part of a cycle. It\u2019s quite normal. There is nothing special about it. And as long as the outlook is negative, then there will be continued pricing pressure. Every bit that is out, there is even increased competition to get it and that creates the downward pricing pressure. So nothing exceptional. I don\u2019t see it accelerating. Other than that is not going way, and we will just continue to manage it and navigate it the way we have been doing so far in the downturn. ", "Jud Bailey", "Great, thank you. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And the last question will come from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital.", "Kurt Hallead", "Hey, good morning. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Kurt. ", "Kurt Hallead", "So just I\u2019m curious Paal, when you think about the \u2013 going back to the M&A dynamic, the Eurasia deal kind of fell through, that\u2019s \u2013 is that something that still could be \u2013 come back on the table at some point going forward? And when you think more broadly about M&A, is the Schlumberger interest right now more in some geographic opportunities or is it in some product specific areas generally speaking?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Just to say the Eurasia deal first of all, obviously we were disappointed that we couldn\u2019t get it closed within the several extensions of the timeline that we agreed with Eurasia. But that deal is now closed for us. So I don\u2019t really have any more comments on that. ", "In terms of other M&A, we continue to be opportunistic. I can\u2019t go into details of what that will entail or what we may or may not do. Other than that, we have a broad view of the entire market and what opportunities are there, what they are interested in. And we continue to evaluate companies on a monthly basis and if there is a willing seller and a good price, then we might be able to do something more, but it\u2019s still too early to say. So I can\u2019t promise anything or I can\u2019t make any further comments on what may happen. Other than that, we continue to be active in assessing the market and look for opportunities to further extend and strengthen our portfolio and we keep generating the cash to allow us to do that. ", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay. That\u2019s great. I\u2019ll keep it there, and we\u2019re seeing a little bit. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Very good.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "All right, so before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed. First, while the business environment clearly got worsened in third quarter, our focus on cost management and transformation has enabled us to deliver strong financial performance and generate significant liquidity, which is a clear competitive edge in this part of the cycle. ", "Second, our forward visibility has again been reduced and we will consequently revert back to managing the company quarter-by-quarter. This means a further round of capacity and overhead reductions in the fourth quarter as we adjust resources to a lower activity outlook. At the same time, we will continue to accelerate our transformation program with the next step being a significant restructuring of our global manufacturing and distribution network, which will further modernize the core part of our company.", "And third, our outlook for the oil market remains unchanged with a continuing tightening of the supply and demand balance as the dramatic cost in E&P investments start to take full effect, ultimately leading to an increase in oil prices. Given the conservative view our customers are taking on 2016 investment levels and the general state of the industry, following a year of low oil prices, we see an increasing likelihood of a timing gap between higher oil prices and a subsequent increase in E&P investment and oilfield activity. ", "In this environment, we continue to proactively manage our business, to preserve our financial strength into 2016, which will allow us to better navigate the market uncertainty and to respond faster to new business opportunities and ultimately, higher activity.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting yesterday. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.", "Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release which is on our Web site. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits, was $0.65. This represent decreases of $0.13 sequentially and $0.85 when compared to the same quarter last year.", "During the quarter we reported $2.1 billion of pre-tax charges. These charges are the direct result of the very challenging market conditions we\u2019re operating in and they include severance, impairment, and restructuring charges.", "The asset impairment charges largely relate to our North America business, which as you know has been the hardest hit during this downturn. All of these charges are described in detail in our earnings press release.", "Our fourth quarter revenue of $7.7 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Approximately one-third of the revenue decline was attributable to pricing. Despite the very challenging environment, both in terms of pricing and activity, pre-tax operating margins only declined by 132 basis points sequentially to 16.6%. This was due to continued strong and proactive cost management across the entire organization.", "Sequential highlights by product group whereas follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $2.2 billion decreased 7% sequentially, while margins decreased 230 basis points to 24.2%. These declines were due to decreases in exploration spending that largely impacted wireline internationally. We also did not see the year-end surge in multiclient and software sales that we typically experience in Q4.", "Drilling Group revenue of $3 billion decreased 8%, primarily due to pricing pressure and activity declines internationally that have mostly affected drilling and measurements and M-I SWACO. As a result of strong cost management, Drilling Group margins only declined 173 basis points to 16.7%.", "Production Group revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 10% primarily due to the continued decline in land activity and further pricing pressure in North America. Production Group margins were essentially flat at 11.3% as SPM projects and higher earnings from our investments in OneSubsea compensated for the effects of the lower activity and pricing pressure.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.2% in the fourth quarter. This was lower than the previous quarter by about 2 percentage points. This decrease was largely due to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the Rest of the World, as well as the favorable revolution of certain tax contingencies and an R&D credit during the quarter.", "Excluding the impact of Cameron, we expect the ETR in 2016 to be around 20%. On a pro-forma basis, we expect the combined Company ETR to be in the low 20s, although this would remain sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings.", "Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During all of 2015, we generated $8.8 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter, we generated $2.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $800 million during 2015 and $200 million during the fourth quarter.", "In light of our strong cash flow generation, yesterday our Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share buyback program. This new program will be effective once the remaining $1.4 billion of authorization under the current program is exhausted.", "During the quarter, our net debt deteriorated a $343 million to $5.5 billion as we continue to invest in future revenue streams. During the fourth quarter, we spend $627 million on CapEx and invested approximately $600 million in SPM projects and $150 million in multiclient projects.", "Full-year 2016 CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM investments is expected to be around $2.4 billion. During the quarter, we spend $398 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares at an average price of $73.86. This is despite being prohibited under the securities laws from repurchasing our shares for about one month prior to the Cameron shareholder vote.", "Let me take this opportunity to talk a little bit about the Cameron transaction. In order to ensure an efficient capital structure within the group, Schlumberger Holding Corporation, our principal U.S subsidiary that we will also refer as SHC, is the legal entity that will acquire Cameron.", "SHC will acquire approximately 137 million shares of common stock from its parent and transfer these shares to Cameron shareholders. SHC will also pay cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction.", "During the fourth quarter, SHC issued $6 billion of notes. These notes have the weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.15% and have maturities to ranging from 2017 to 2025. SHC will use the proceeds from this debt issuance to partially fund the purchase of the 137 million shares from the parent company. SHC will then use a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings to finance the difference between the proceeds received from the issuance of these notes and the cash required to complete the Cameron merger.", "As a result of this debt issuance, Schlumberger\u2019s pre-tax interest expense will increase approximately $40 million in Q1 as compared to Q4. As we close the Cameron transaction, we will begin to incur merger and integration related costs. These will include transaction costs, the cost of the integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments, as well as one-off cost to achieve the synergies. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter the transaction closes and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will separately call out these charges for you as are incurred.", "And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you Simon and good morning everyone. Negative market sentiments intensified in the fourth quarter with global oil production of oil continuing, extending the various trend in global oil inventories and causing a further fall in oil prices, which reach a 12-year low in December. The worsening market conditions added further pressure to the deep financial crisis throughout the oil and gas value chain and prompt the operators to make further cuts to the already low E&P investment levels.", "For many of our customers, available cash and annual budgets were exhausted well before the half way point over the fourth quarter, leading to unscheduled and abrupt activity cancellations, creating an operating environment that is increasingly complex to navigate and where the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.", "As planned we implemented another significant adjustment to our cost and resource base during the fourth quarter, including the release of 10,000 employees as well as further streamlining of our overhead infrastructure and asset base.", "In spite of these significant structural adjustments, our overall fourth quarter results were in some areas impacted by events that were either outside of our control or where we chose to maintain cost and resource levels, pending availability of additional customer budgets in the New Year.", "However, as we exited the fourth quarter, I believe we\u2019ve made the necessary adjustments to our cost and resource base and that we\u2019re well positioned to continue to deliver solid financial results in both the first quarter and throughout 2016, which will clearly be another very challenging year for our industry.", "Looking closer at our fourth quarter results, global revenue fell 9% sequentially, driven by a continuing decline in rig activity and persistent pricing pressure throughout our global operations together with a broad range of activity disruptions, project delays and cancellations.", "In North America revenue was down 14% sequentially, which is inline with the reduction in the drilling rig counts and driven by exhausted customer budgets and cash flows together with the extended holiday period.", "Our North American pre-tax operating margins remain very resilient at 7.1% driven by proactive cost and resource management, excellent performance from our supply chain and distribution organization, strong execution and new technology sales from our operations, all of which were further supported by our transformation program.", "On land, in both U.S and Canada, the weakening activity resulted in additional commercial pressure for all product lines and in particular in pressure pumping where pricing levels drop further into unsustainable territory for both operating margins and cash flow.", "We also saw continuous pricing pressure and activity reductions in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, as the drilling rig count drops by another 2% sequentially and where year-end multiclient seismic sales were largely muted.", "Turning to the international markets, revenue were 6% lower sequentially as customer budget cuts, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown, and the absence of the traditional year-end product and multiclient seismic sales all impacted results. Our fourth quarter international operating margins drop to 22%, driven by a further pricing pressure and unfavorable revenue mix and a significant impact of activity disruptions, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.", "In Latin America revenue declined 1% sequentially with pre-tax operating margins improving by 229 basis points to 23%. In terms of revenue, solid activity in Mexico and Ecuador was offset by a further budget reductions in Colombia and Brazil, while the weakening of the peso had a negative impact in our fourth quarter revenue in Argentina.", "Margins remain resilient across the area as the cost and resource base adjustments made during the previous quarter took full effect and as we continue to leverage our transformation program. This combination more than offset the persistent pricing pressure we saw throughout our customer base.", "In Europe/CIS/Africa, revenue fell 9% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins dropped 138 basis points to 20.8%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble, the start of the seasonal winter slowdown in Russia, and a noticeable reduction in activity throughout the Caspian region, all impacted the results.", "In Europe, activity in Norway was resilient, but this was more than offset by a significant reduction in continental Europe and U.K., while in Africa solid in Nigeria and Algeria was not enough to offset the further weakening in the Central and West Africa.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 5% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins decreased by 448 basis points to 22.5%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia where we saw a general weakening in activity throughout the region, which was most pronounced in Malaysia and Australia, where project ended and customer budgets were cut further.", "Fourth quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East, where solid activity in Kuwait and Iraq was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. In terms of operating margins, pricing pressure across the area was only partly offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base and where project cancellations, delayed start off of new project, and activity disruptions due to 2015 budget limitations, all contributed to the sequential reduction in operating margins.", "Our fourth quarter results cap a year where we\u2019ve faced the most severe industry downturn in 30 years, but where we through proactive management and strong execution, have shown that we can navigate the challenging operating environment better than most and produce solid financial results while maintaining the bandwidth to pursue and capitalize on opportunities that strengthen the competitive position of the Company.", "So as we prepare for another very challenging year, I\u2019d like to summarize what we\u2019ve delivered in 2015, as this sets a very good benchmark for our expectations and ambitions for the year to come.", "Looking first at the top line, full-year revenue dropped by 27% in 2015, driven by a 39% drop in North America where we\u2019ve further strengthen our market position in spite of our decision not to pursue work that falls outside of our financial return requirements. Our international revenue fell by 21% in 2015, which is comparable to the drop in E&P investments.", "Included in this revenue drop is both the impact of our higher leverage towards the exploration, deepwater, and seismic markets, where E&P investment saw significantly higher reductions and also included the impact of the strong dollar against a number of foreign currencies.", "These revenue mix headwinds are fully absorbed in our results at this stage, which makes our international business a highly compressed coiled spring, which we will capitalize on when E&P investments and customer activity starts recovering. In addition to this, we\u2019ve in the past year significantly increased our tender win rate, which further strengthens our very solid contracts portfolio and puts us in a great position to increase market share going forward.", "Looking at 2015 profitability, full-year global operating margins fell by only 342 basis points to 18.4%, as we maintained our wide margin lead in the international markets and as we now are also approaching a similar margin gap in North America. We\u2019ve managed to protect our margins due to a very proactive approach to cost and resource management and by further accelerating our corporate transformation program. Together these actions have delivered detrimental margins of 31% in 2015, which is about half the level seen in previous downturns.", "Turning next to cash, our free cash flow in 2015 was about $5 billion, which represents net income conversion rate of 114%. This includes CapEx of $2.4 billion, which is now down to 59% of DNA, in addition to investments of $1.4 billion in future revenue streams in the areas of SPM and multiclient seismic.", "Our ability to generate free cash in this part of the cycle is unmatched in the oil field services industry and gives us a unique ability to capitalize on the significant business opportunities that the current market conditions present. From our free cash flow we\u2019ve returned $4.6 billion of cash to our shareholders through $2.4 billion in dividend payments and $2.2 billion worth of stock buyback.", "In addition to this, we\u2019ve spent about $500 million on M&A, where we continue to target smaller disruptive technology companies that we can integrate into our existing and future workflows and deploy through our expensive global organization. The strength of our free cash flow can also be seen from our net debt level which has only increased by $160 million on a full-year basis, driven by the financial performance I\u2019ve just described.", "With respect to the pending Cameron transaction, the integration plans are now largely completed and we are fully ready for day one. We still expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2016, and we\u2019ve already received antitrust approvals from the U.S., Canada, Russia, and Brazil.", "The fact that we structured the deal to include 78% of stock provides us with a necessary installation from the ongoing market turmoil and during the fourth quarter we also secured the required financing for our U.S entity that will make the acquisition.", "Turning next to people, we\u2019ve in the past year unfortunately have to reduce more than 34,000 employees, which represents an unprecedented number for the Company and where we all have been impacted as we\u2019ve gone through the disheartening process of letting colleagues and friends go in all parts of the Company.", "I\u2019m at this stage optimistic thing we\u2019ve completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn and I look forward to be able to shift focus throughout our organization from the negative sentiments of the past year towards a brighter future as we work through the remaining challenges of this downturn.", "In terms of R&D, we did reduce investment levels in 2015, but we were still able to protect our capabilities and ensure the progress of all our key projects. In the past year we made solid advances on several new technology fronts through a combination of organic and inorganic efforts and we look forward to update you further on this in our external communications in the coming year.", "And lastly in 2015, we significantly accelerated our corporate transformation program, stepping up both investment levels and the detailed engagement of our global organization. As part of this, we prepared a comprehensive and granular three-year transformation plan covering each of our 600 business units with specific deliverables and business impact goals set at all levels in our organization.", "In parallel with this, we\u2019ve delivered noticeable cost savings and efficiency gains that can be seen in our 2015 financial results, together with a 23% reduction in our customer NPT rate, which is the largest annual improvement we\u2019ve ever achieved.", "In summary, while 2015 has been extremely challenging year for the industry and for Schlumberger, we\u2019ve clearly demonstrated our ability to navigate a complex landscape and capitalize on the opportunities the current business environment presents and we\u2019re fully prepared to repeat these efforts and achievements in 2016. So while we all look forward to a recovery in the oil price, and the market conditions in our industry, it is evident that the longer the current market environment continues, the stronger we will emerge as a Company relative to our competitors when the upturn ultimately comes.", "Turning next to the market outlook, we still believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand continues to tighten, driven by both solid growth in demand and by weakening supply as the dramatic cuts in E&P investments are starting to take effect. In North America, our shale oil production is declining more or less as we expected and was in December below the levels from one year ago.", "The apparent resilience in production outside of OPEC and North America is in many cases driven by producers opening the taps wide open to maximize cash flow, which also means that we will likely see higher decline rates after these short-term actions are exhausted.", "So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by fares to reduce growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional uranium exports and the continued various trends in global oil inventories, we still expect a positive movement in oil prices during 2016 with specific timing being the function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates. This means that the market outlook for oil field services in the coming quarters will remain challenging at the pressure on activity and service pricing is set to continue.", "It also means that 2016 E&P investment levels will fall for a second successive year and that any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a 2017 event. Still at Schlumberger we remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings and to our global reach the strength of our technology offering and our corporate transformation program, we\u2019re currently creating a considerable leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share, deliver superior earnings and margins and continue to generate unmatched levels of free cash flow. Thank you very much.", "We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer", "Thank you. Thank you very much and congrats with another great -- relatively great year with free cash flow and solid performance.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Ole.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks.", "Ole Slorer", "When it comes to the macro outlook that you just painted, how should we think about the overall oilfield macro cycle? And relative to the internal momentum that you\u2019re creating within Schlumberger with respect to the ongoing transformation process, I presume that a lot of the lowest hanging fruit has been picked in the transformation process. So if you could just bring us up to speed about how we should think about earnings projections over the next couple of quarters, several quarters with respect to those two kind of factors?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at our earnings trajectory in the coming quarters, it is obviously largely going to be driven by what continues to happen in the market around us in terms of the spend from our customers. But if you look at our ability to, I would say, counter the significant pricing pressure as well as the activity reductions, the transformation is indeed playing a significant role. I think it\u2019s fair to say, like you say that a lot of the low hanging fruits we\u2019ve already picked, but we\u2019re now getting into the deeper part of the transformation where we\u2019re making significant structural changes to how we go about doing our work and conducting our business. And this is basically laid out in the three-year plan that we worked on in 2015, which is going to take us from 2016 all the way out to 2019. And here we\u2019ve broken down all the initiatives into specific actions and plans and targets for all the various business units we\u2019ve around the world and I think with this, I would say, formalized way of driving performance I think we should look to put even more impact into our results in the coming three years and what you seen in the previous years.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay. I\u2019ll take that. With respect to the free cash flow that you generated and clearly having a strong balance sheet, today is, I\u2019d imagine, whereas an awful lot when it comes to the bargaining power that you\u2019ve around the world. So how should we think about the opportunity around generating that or putting that to work as internal CapEx versus SPM, which I saw you just picked up a bit now again in the fourth quarter, and versus acquisitions?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, first of all, we continue to have a very strong focus on generating the cash. And I think 2015 was another solid year. It was not perfect. There were several things that I think we could have done better, but $5 billion of free cash flow in this environment is not bad. Now how we go about spending the cash, there is really no change to the philosophy that we\u2019ve in any part of this cycle. The first thing we look to is to reinvest into the business and that is CapEx for the service and product segments that we have. In 2016, we\u2019re going to keep CapEx flat with 2015 and that you may ask why? If you look at the base business, it is indeed coming down, but we\u2019ve certain new activities that we\u2019re looking to invest into in particular the land drilling market for the rig of the future and there is a few other strategic investments that we\u2019re looking to make when it comes to our internal CapEx. In addition to this, we continue to invest in future revenue streams, both multiclient seismic where we\u2019ve a significant program going on in Mexico. And at this stage of the cycle, there are also significant SPM opportunities and we\u2019ve really stepped up our efforts in screening and evaluating these opportunities and we will capitalize on them when they meet our internal requirements. Beyond this, we review dividends annually. We are not increasing dividends this year. And then beyond that for the coming year, it\u2019s going to be a balancing of the opportunities we\u2019ve on M&A and the opportunities we have to buyback our stock. That is how we\u2019re planning to spend the cash. Simon, you want to add something?", "Simon Ayat", "No, I think you\u2019ve summarized it very well. I guess, 2016 is going to be marked by the big event of integrating Cameron and there is a lot of transaction as I described. We bought up $6 billion and we will be paying for the acquisition. We are also issuing shares, but we\u2019ve the $10 billion in new program that w e will commence as soon as we exhaust the previous one.", "Ole Slorer", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "James West", "Hey, good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "James West", "And congratulations also on -- just excellent execution really all year for you and your management team and all your employees and especially in the fourth quarter.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you very much.", "James West", "I wanted to follow-up a little bit on what you were talking about there in the second part of Ole\u2019s question about really the SPM business. It seems -- I did notice the pickup in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s probably project timing, but are you -- at this point are you chasing more projects? Are you getting more inbounds? And you talked a little bit about or you mentioned that your screening process had been updated or upgraded. Could you talk a little bit more about that and how you see this playing out over the next couple of quarters, couple of years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, we\u2019re seeing significantly more SPM opportunities at this stage, of the cycle, given our ability to generate cash and given the status of our balance sheet. So we\u2019ve -- we haven\u2019t changed our screening process, but we\u2019ve put more resources into it, so we can process more of these opportunities. And we\u2019re prepared to step up our investments in SPM. As you noted, there was a step up in Q4 and it might not be at that level every quarter going forward, but I\u2019d say that going into 2016 SPM is an area that we\u2019re interested in investing further in. It provides us with solid long-term contract. It provides us with the ability to deploy our entire capability set and generate good returns and good cash for the Company. So it is a very interesting opportunity set for us that we\u2019re actively pursuing.", "James West", "Okay. And then maybe another follow-up, the press release was littered with technology success stories and it seems like the technology adoption rate has picked up significantly during the downturn. I know you have given out numbers before on sales, percentage of sales on new technologies. Could you give us an update there on what you\u2019re seeing on the adoption rates and if that percentages has improved?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, during this downturn the level of new technology sales which is basically technologies that we have commercialized in the past five years is at a significantly higher level than what we\u2019ve seen in previous downturns. The new technology sales as a percentage of total revenues in 2015, is 24% which is markedly higher than what we saw in the previous downturn in 2008, 2009. This is partially down to the broad range of technologies that we have, and in fact that a number of them are focused on driving, I would say cost and efficiency for our customers. And these type of technology are as valid in terms of being bought and being operated during the downturn as they are in the upturn. So strong sales, and we continue to commercialize new technologies during 2015. So this obviously has had a very good impact on our financial performance in the past year, and I expect it to continue to do that in the year to come.", "James West", "Perfect. Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Angie Sedita", "I echo the sentiment, very solid quarter for the quarter and for the year given good business conditions, so well done. Maybe, Paal, we can go a little bit more granular on thoughts and obviously 2016 is a question mark, but thoughts into Q1 on a geo-market basis and walk us through where you\u2019re thinking on a revenue and margin sign, if you will?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I\u2019m not going to review the details by air Angie, what I think we\u2019re going to do. If you\u2019re looking for an indication of how we -- what we plan for and how we see Q1 shaping up, its going to be another very challenging quarter both from an activity and a pricing standpoint. The reasons new lows in oil prices is going to be reflected in lower REIT content and more activity disruptions we believe. This is going to be continued budget pressure throughout the first half from all customer groups where they now have to operate within cash flow. In addition we\u2019re going to see the winter slowdown in the Northern hemisphere in Q1 which is going to be another activity headwind. So I would say that, rather than going into margins and revenues, if we focus in on EPS, I would say that the current Q1, EPS consensus is probably a best case scenario from what we can see today in terms of Q1 earnings.", "Angie Sedita", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on Cameron, I know there is only so much you can say at this point. But if you have any further color, you can talk about on the opportunity set within Cameron as you move forward. But also talk us through or walk us through the integration of Cameron within Schlumberger, both operationally and how it will show up in the financial?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Right. So, on the start up of the integration we are largely ready with our integration plans. We\u2019ve had a sizable team made up of both Cameron and Schlumberger please working diligently on preparing these plans since we announced the transaction back in August. We reviewed all the plans in December and they have been approved, and we are basically ready for day one at this stage. Closing is now basically pending a few more countries in terms of antitrust approvals, and we do expect that we will close during the first quarter. In terms of synergies, the detailed work that we\u2019ve done has really confirmed the numbers that we put up at the announcement. Lots of opportunities which initially are going to be cost focus, but this transaction is largely a revenue transaction and we are very excited about what we can do by joining the R&D forces of the two companies and creating the integrated drilling and production systems that we have laid out earlier. In terms of integrating Cameron as an organization, it would actually be a fairly simply task. Because Cameron as it is today will become the fourth product group of Schlumberger together with characterization, drilling and production. And Scott Rowe, the CEO of Cameron is going to join us and continue to head of Cameron in its present form. So the main thing we were focusing are in terms of integration initially. It\u2019s going to be to coordinate the customer interface and to streamline the back office and also then morph or merge over time the R&D organization. So it is relatively a simple integration, because Cameron would slide in, in its present form into Schlumberger as the fourth group.", "Angie Sedita", "All right. Fair enough. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "Hi. Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Kurt Hallead", "Good morning. I just had a -- I had a couple of quick follow-up questions and some discussions within investors around the SPM dynamic. And in that context, Paal, just given the decline in oil prices year-to-date and the write down on the project in Colombia, there\u2019s some questions out there just relating to potential incremental risk around existing SPM projects, and maybe you could put that into the context of maybe how you access risk on varying projects and maybe how you look at it from a portfolio approach?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Right. So if you want to -- let\u2019s start off with the write down we did in Colombia which is really an isolated event. This is a project that\u2019s being going on between 10 and 15 years. We\u2019re in the later years of the project. And it\u2019s really the only project at this stage in our portfolio that has our compensation directly linked to the oil price. So with only a few years left and the oil price being at the very low level, this is what caused the impairment of the -- or the remaining balance we have. If you look at the rest of the portfolio and the new contract that we\u2019ve entered into in recent years, these are all fee per barrel type of contract where obviously the project economics are linked to the oil price, but where our compensation is basically an isolated fee per barrel set up. So as with any of these projects they do carry a higher risk than what our base business does. But we are -- I would say very comfortable with being able to -- I would say identify and manage these risks. And with the screening process we had with the internal approval process that we have, I\u2019m very comfortable with the step that we have in terms of the projects that we take on and that these all will generate very good returns for the company. And I would also say that the project in Colombia overall provided also very good returns and good cash flow throughout the life of the project.", "Kurt Hallead", "All right. That was great color. Then maybe if I could follow-up just on the margin front. If I understand correctly, you guys are trying to manage your business such that you can maintain a 20% margin maybe internationally here at the trough and maybe 5% in the North American market. I know a lot of that is being driven by your transformation process. And given the drop that we\u2019ve had recently in oil price and the impact that we\u2019ll have on E&P spend drop in 2016, how much harder do you think its going to be to maybe maintain those targets?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "But obviously fighting the margin pressure with both dramatic reductions in activity and significant pricing pressure, it\u2019s tough. We have the added tool in our tool kit which is the transformation on top of our very, very solid management team that is excellent at executing, but it is tough to maintain margins at the levels that we currently see. I\u2019m very pleased with how the North America team has managed and navigated in the past year, and 7.1% in Q4, I think is excellent. It\u2019s going to be tough to continue to keep it at these levels. But with the energy and the focus our team on the ground in North America has, I\u2019m optimistic that we will continue to significantly outperform the rest of the field there. Now if you look at the international margins, they are actually holding up recently well. We\u2019re now six quarters into the downturn internationally, and we\u2019re all at 253 basis points down which is basically half what we saw in 2009 in the last downturn. But it\u2019s a very dynamic environment, and there\u2019s always going to be quarterly variations driven by unplanned events. And if you look at LAM for an example, we had a big drop in Q3; yes we managed to close that back in Q4. Some of the actions that we put in place in the third quarter took full effect. Now in Q4 we did see a significant impact on our MEA margins and part of this is pricing and part of it is permanent activity reduction. But there is also a significant part which is temporary which is down to delays and stoppages. And if you look at the team we have on the ground, they have a long list of actions in place to address what they can in order to offset some of these margin headwinds. So I can't promise you that we\u2019re going to get all the margins back in MEA, but I would say that the MEA team is clearly unhappy having being surpassed by the LAM team at the most profitable area. So I really look forward to the internal competition between these two.", "Kurt Hallead", "That\u2019s great color. Thanks a lot, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Michael, your line is open. Check your mute button.", "Michael LaMotte", "Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Simon Ayat", "Good morning.", "Michael LaMotte", "Paal, you mentioned a couple of times the three year transformation plan, and I imagine you\u2019ll go into more detail in April. But can you just broad stroke the key categories that were identified as new areas of opportunity in the three year plan?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. There is no new areas that we have identified. What we\u2019re doing with the three year plan is that, in the past couple of years there\u2019s been a lot of work done in the central team formulate the detailed concepts and principals of how we want to change, how we operate our business. And these initiatives and these concepts are all now fully mature and they come together with a change management process that we have also put a lot of effort into designing. And what we\u2019re doing with the three year plan is basically formalizing how each of these initiatives will now be translated into actions and results throughout the global organization. So in the past couple of years we have been pursuing the low hanging fruit. We are now going into the -- to the structural changes of our business that would also provide an additional step of savings and improvements in the years to come. But the focus is around asset and inventory management, its maintenance and repairs, transportation, distribution, supply chain, back office, quality assurance. It\u2019s all the things that we\u2019ve talked about in previous years, but its now being formalized and itemized down to the business unit levels. We have around 600 business units down to the country level and they all now have specific actions and targets on each of these line items to implement the changes that we have been preparing centrally for the past few years.", "Michael LaMotte", "Okay. And as we think about the financial impact, is order of magnitude similar to the low hanging fruit, it\u2019s just the timing in terms of the flow through, the impact may take a little longer? How do we think about the implications on the financials?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I\u2019d say the impact of the transformation going forward will at least be as big as it\u2019s been in previous year and probably even higher in the years to come as we really start changing fundamental parts of how we conduct business. So this is not decreasing I would say, it\u2019s stable to increasing in terms of impact going forward.", "Michael LaMotte", "Okay. So low hanging fruit doesn\u2019t mean expect less going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, absolutely not.", "Michael LaMotte", "Great. All right. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "James Wicklund", "Good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Jim.", "James Wicklund", "Obviously the Cameron, Schlumberger OneSubsea JV has been a big success, it led to marriage. And now you\u2019re doing an MoU with Golar, and looking on gas monetization solutions. Can you talk about how far the breadth -- how far this takes you, the Schlumberger Octopus grabs another segment of business? Can you talk a little bit about where this should go and why you did it?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well this is an MoU where we\u2019ve had -- we had good discussions about the concepts of how we can combine some of our capabilities and efforts with the capabilities that Golar has and this is something that we will continue to work with them going forward. It is an interesting I would say combination. And I don\u2019t have a lot of comments beyond this at this stage other than that it is the partnership that we\u2019re looking to establish and to grow going forward.", "James Wicklund", "Okay. And just again, breadth. You\u2019ve got now subsea, you\u2019ve got equipment, you\u2019re doing gas monetization. Kurt and James asked about the SPM business. You had said before in previous conference calls that you'd embrace a number of different business models. Is this the fruition of those kind of statements?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I would say it is. But we don\u2019t know this, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the main part of our business is, I would say oil free services and products and equipments. So we will continue to focus on leading each individual market that we continue, that we participate in for individual products and services. But with the integration capabilities and with the ability we have to pursue different type of business models, we are also looking to combine all of these things like you indicate Jim, to create more business opportunities for the company. So we are not pursuing only these. We have a huge focus on making sure that we standout and we continue to drive performance in the base business. But when you combine all of these things, there is a broad range of opportunities for us that we\u2019re also pursuing.", "James Wicklund", "That\u2019s very helpful. And my follow-up, if I could. Are we willing to take the chance and say that 2016 could be the bottom of the cycle or do you guys think today that 2017 will be worse than 2016?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think it\u2019s too early to say Jim, but I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t currently think that 2017 is going to be worse. I think -- but with that said, I\u2019m still not ready to say that we are troughing in 2016. I\u2019ll be focusing in on executing basically quarter-by-quarter. I\u2019m still optimistic, and I would hope that 2016 is the trough, but I\u2019m not ready to rule on it yet.", "James Wicklund", "We'll keep our fingers crossed as well. Thanks sir, very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.", "William Herbert", "Thank you. Good morning. Back to SPM, I\u2019m curious with regard to the projects that you\u2019re seeing. Is there any change with regard to the kind of projects that you\u2019re seeing now on a leading edge basis, more offshore versus onshore? And then moreover, with regard to as you evaluate these projects, recognizing that there\u2019re are fee per barrel on the one hand, there must be an embedded oil price assumed as you\u2019re looking at these projects in terms of a threshold oil price is required for the NSC to make capital if it is an NSC partner on these. So can you talk about the mix of projects, how it has changed and embedded oil prices associated with the capital allocation?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Right. So, on the projects there is no shift in what the projects are. I mean, we\u2019re looking at a certain set of projects. These are relatively small compared to what our customers would be interest in. And they are generally late life fields where we can come in and try to change the decline curve and add reserves and production to the field in late life. We are generally focused on LAM, and the only thing I would say is that the opportunity set has increased. There are more customers that are coming to us now that has these types of fields and they\u2019re interested in doing these types of business models with us. So there\u2019s not a dramatic shift in the type of assets that we\u2019re looking at, but generally there\u2019s more of them. And for the fields that we enter into a contract zone, obviously we will have to look at the total economics of the field for the lifetime of the contract which is generally I would say at least 15 years. So in that it\u2019s obviously important that the total project is economical, and then the way we set up our contract is today generally on the fee per barrel where we are I would say insulated against variations in oil price. That being said, if it goes down, we don\u2019t get hit at all. But again we are leavening the upside to our customers if oil prices are higher than what is in the assumption. So we have a very, I would say solid process on evaluating this. And like I said earlier in the call we\u2019re actively pursuing these type of contracts where we can get the terms that we want contractually, and where we are satisfied that the reservoir holds the upside both in production and reserves.", "William Herbert", "Okay. And another one from me, sort of an extension of Jim's question in terms of testing the boundaries as to how broad, how plausibly broad your business model extends to; and that is; are you contemplating or evaluating anything on the clean technology front?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, not at this stage. I mean, we continue to -- I mean, if you look at minimizing the environmental impact with what we do at the company and our carbon footprint absolutely, we have several programs in place both in terms of, of how we conduct business as well as how we develop new technologies on this. But in terms of venturing outside of our current space which oil conservatives, there is no plans of doing that at this stage.", "William Herbert", "Okay. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson", "Great, thank you. A question on kind of your Middle East Asia Pac business; obviously margins came down a good bit this quarter and a lot going on behind the scenes. I was wondering if you could help me kind of sort out some of the dynamics behind there. You talked about some activity disruptions in the Middle East. There's pricing going on. Asia Pac is probably also down -- probably also going to get hit pretty hard as well. Can you help us kind of understand some of those and how much of that\u2019s kind of one time you think on the quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Now I tried hard -- I tried to answer that earlier David in the call and I would just say that, yes MEA margins dropped a fair bit in Q4, but there are variations in terms of all operations of activity that you will basically get some variations and in margins going forward. I gave LaMotte the example. Now there is significant pricing pressure. There is lower activity in parts of MEA, but are also some temporary aspects of what happened in the quarter where there were delays of big projects in terms of the startup where we had significant resources standing by and there were also some customers that stopped activity during the quarter because they were running out of annual budgets. And these budgets are going to be replenished now in January in which case we decided to carry the cost under resources. So I cannot promise you that we will regain all the loses in Q4 in terms of margins, but lots of actions in place to try to repeat what we\u2019ve done in LAM over the course of 2015.", "David Anderson", "Those operational disruptions, do you think a lot of those are going to come back in the first quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Some of them will. And some of the -- for the ones that -- well we know which one they are and those are the ones to be carried the resources for. And for the ones that aren\u2019t, you also know what they are in which case we have been cutting the resources.", "David Anderson", "And then on the pricing concessions, Paal you\u2019ve been talking about and you talked about it last quarter as well. Is this on kind of new work that's being tendered or is this kind of pricing concessions on existing contracts?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It\u2019s a combination. When you tender for new work you will need to access what the growing rate in the market is, and in some cases you\u2019ll get the opportunity to hang on to the existing contracts or even extend them provided there are some concessions given. So this is a combination.", "David Anderson", "Okay. And would the transformation -- does the transformation you think offset pricing over time largely?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well if you look at internationally in 2015, we have managed to offset internationally quite a lot of it. Can we do all of it? That\u2019s probably going to be tough. But it is a significant counter to the pricing pressure that we\u2019re seeing, yes.", "David Anderson", "Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "William Sanchez", "Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I was hoping before we ended the call that perhaps you could just speak generally about customer expectations internationally in terms of CapEx for \u201816. I mean, do you guys have a bottoms-up view yet at this point in terms of the size of the decline we could see as we try to think about calibrating overall top-line international revenue declines potentially for \u201816?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I mean, if you look at 2015, national spend was down about 20%. And then there is a range of surveys out now from third parties and the kind of average or consensus from these surveys is about, I would say more than a 10% reduction in international spend. So, if you go by these then yes it will be another challenging year. But also I think while we look at full year numbers, I think its also important to keep in mind the five or six quarters slide we have seen now in international E&P spend where we have had a significant drop in our revenue from Q4 of 2014 versus -- down to Q4 of this year and into Q1 of \u201916. So while the year-over-year numbers for full year matters, I think it\u2019s also important to look at the quarter levels we have now which is obviously significantly down. And actually if you do the Q1 revenue consensus for us, based on what your guys, analysts have done, four times that is already 17% down overall in revenue for us. So in that sense, the current level of activity and spend is already way down on a full year basis going forward.", "William Sanchez", "Okay. Thanks for that. I guess Simon, one for you. Given the pending Cameron acquisition here in the first quarter, is there any blackout period on Schlumberger being able to buyback stock as we approach that close?", "Simon Ayat", "No, none. Actually we are -- we will, after the blackout because of the earnings which is just in couple of days, we will be free to go back to the market. No, none, Bill.", "William Sanchez", "Okay. I\u2019ll turn it back. Thanks for the time.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Boyd", "Hi. Thanks, guys. I have a question for Simon, and more on the currency side continuing there. It looks like you\u2019ve done a really good job so far this year of managing the currency risk. So, I would just like to understand how do you manage the currency risk in SPM projects, especially as you ramp those? And then if you could just help us, you quantified the revenue impact from currency this year. Can you help us with the international margin impact from how well you manage the currency?", "Simon Ayat", "Okay. Well, thanks. The last question. Let me just take overall the currency situation. As far as our international operation overall we have a natural hedge which, what it means is basically we match the revenue that we get the local currency. It is inline with our local cost and local currencies, it varies between jurisdictions. So in some areas we loose a bit on the currency but then gains in other places compensate for it. In 2015, you\u2019ve seen the numbers; we have lost a lot of revenue because of currency. And almost 20% of the reduction of revenue between 2014 to 2015 was currency but actually did not impact the margin significantly. So it is all international. Yes, there is a bit of Canada, but the rest is outside NAM and we manage it as I said, it is natural hedge. We prevent ourselves from taking more local currency than we consume locally for local cost. As far as SPM is concerned, normally most of our SPM projects actually are dollar based, revenue wise, and those that have local currency they will basically reflect the same policy that I just mentioned to you, that we don\u2019t take more than what we locally require for our cost and the third part that it is also bigger in SPM project. So naturally -- we are naturally hedged.", "Daniel Boyd", "Okay. So that -- are you saying that your margins didn't benefit from the currency? If your EBIT held up this year, you could have a few hundred basis point benefit in your margin. Is that accurate?", "Simon Ayat", "No, the currency -- big impact of the currency this last year was, one because of Venezuela, because we changed the currency rate. But otherwise did not impact us on the margins.", "Daniel Boyd", "Okay. Thank you.", "Simon Farrant", "Turn it over to Paal, Matt ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Simon. So before we close this morning, I\u2019d just like to summarize the three most important points that we have discussed. First the business environment in the oil industry we can further into fourth quarter leaving traditional reductions in both activity and pricing levels and making 2015 the worse industry downturn since 1986. In spite of this we delivered strong full year performance compared to previous downturns generating $5 billion in free cash flow and returning $4.6 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks. In addition we spent $500 million on technology acquisitions that further broadened our portfolio and yet we increased our net debt by only $160 million.", "Second, 2016 will be another challenging year during which we will aim to continue to deliver superior financial results empowered with proceeding and capitalizing on the broad opportunity set the current market environment presents. We remain constructive in our view on the market outlook for the medium term, and continue to believe that the underlying balance of supply and demand is tightening driven by growth in demand, weakening supply as the massive cuts in the E&P investments take further effect and by the size of the annual supply replacement challenge.", "Lastly we look forward to closing our merger with Cameron International during the first quarter where the integration planning is largely complete for day one, and with anti-trust approvals all progressing on track. We are excited about what the combination of our two companies will bring. I look forward to joining forces with more than 20,000 Cameron employees.", "Overall we remain confident in our ability to continue to weather this downturn embedded in our surroundings through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering and the extent of our corporate transformation program.", "That concludes the call. Thank you very much for attending.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 10 AM Central Time today through February 22. You may access the AT&T teleconference replay system at any time by dialing 1800-475-6701 and entering the access code 373076. International participants dial 320-365-3844.

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given to you at that time. And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited first quarter 2016 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting.", "Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to materially differ from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filings and other SEC filings.", "Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "I'll now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.", "First quarter earnings per share was $0.40. Excluding charges recorded in the first and fourth quarters of last year, this represents decreases of $0.25 sequentially and $0.66 when compared to the same quarter last year. Our first quarter revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margin decreased 281 basis points to 14%. These decreases, which were driven by continued activity decline and pricing pressures, resulted in decremental margins of 32%.", "Highlights by product group were as follows. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 20% sequentially while margin decreased 480 basis points to 19%, resulting in decremental margins of 43%. These decreases were largely due to seasonally lower software sales and a hold in higher-margin exploration activity.", "Drilling Group revenue of $2.5 billion decreased 16% sequentially while margin declined 183 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by activity declines across all areas. Despite these declines, decremental margins were limited to 27% on strong cost controls.", "Production Group revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 335 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing erosion in North America land. These declines, offset in part by strong contributions from SPM [Schlumberger Production Management], resulted in decremental margins of 33%.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate [ETR] excluding charges and credits was 16% in the first quarter compared to 18% in the previous quarter. This decrease was largely driven by the significant sequential drop in pre-tax operating income we experienced in our North America business. With these reduced overall levels of pre-tax income that we are currently experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax expense line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR. This can make our ETR more volatile as compared to prior years.", "Looking forward, the acquisition of Cameron is not expected to have a material impact on our overall ETR. However, due to the sensitivity of the overall geographic earnings mix of the combined business, we do expect an increase in the ETR for the rest of the year as compared to the first quarter.", "We generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite the consumption of working capital that we typically experience during Q1, which is driven by the annual payments associated with employee compensation; as well, the payment of $260 million in severance during the quarter.", "Our net debt increased $1.1 billion during the quarter to $6.7 billion. We ended the quarter was total cash and investments of $14.8 billion. Cameron had $2.2 billion of cash at closing, and we paid the Cameron shareholders $2.8 billion in connection with the transaction. Therefore, we effectively started off the quarter with $14.2 billion of total cash and investments.", "During the quarter, we spent $475 million to repurchase 7.1 million shares at an average price of $67.43.", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included: roughly $550 million on CapEx; $600 million of SPM investments; $170 million of multi-client; and $630 million of dividend payments. Excluding the impact of Cameron, full-year 2015 CapEx is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. This amount does not include investments in SPM or multi-client. Cameron's full-year 2016 CapEx is expected to be approximately $200 million, of which $37 million was spent during the first quarter.", "Let me take a few minutes to provide some additional financial details relating to the Cameron acquisition, which as you know closed on April 1. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we assumed gross debt with a carrying value of $2.8 billion. During April, we repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of this debt. This combined with the effect of the purchase accounting adjustment to fair value of the debt will result in Schlumberger's pre-tax net interest cost increasing by approximately $13 million per quarter starting in Q2.", "We still expect pre-tax synergies to be approximately $300 million over the next 12 months and $600 million in the second year. These numbers consist primarily of costs as opposed to revenue synergies in the first couple of years. However, we remain most excited about the opportunities for revenue synergies, which are very significant and expected to grow considerably in the future year.", "Although we are in the process of finalizing our purchase accounting, we estimate that the pre-tax amortization expense as a result of fair value adjustment to the acquired assets will add approximately $65 million on a quarterly basis to our corporate and other expense line. The transaction will be accretive on both an EPS and cash flow basis within the current year.", "As a reminder, going forward we will be incurring merger and integration-related charges. These will include transaction costs, the cost of integration team, one-off purchase accounting adjustments, as well as costs to achieve synergies. These will be most significant in Q2, but they will continue for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. We will separately call out these charges for you as they are incurred.", "One last item is how we will report Cameron going forward. Since the acquisition of Smith five years ago, our groups have served as the primary reporting for SEC purposes. Starting in Q2, Cameron will become the fourth group in the structure, along with our existing Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, and Production groups. Additionally, the revenue of these four groups will be combined and reported consistent with Schlumberger's current area structure. However, this will only be revenue reporting, as we will no longer report operating income by area. Paal will further elaborate on the rationale for this change.", "Shortly after this call, we will be posting pro forma quarterly financial information in this format going back to Q1 2013, taking you through Q1 of 2016.", "And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Think you, Simon, and good morning, everyone.", "Activity fell sharply in the first quarter, as the industry displayed clear signs of facing a full-scale cash crisis. We experienced activity reductions worldwide, with the rate of disruption reaching unprecedented levels.", "The start of a new year and a new budget cycle represented a further fall in customer E&P spend, and we expect continued weakening in the second quarter given the magnitude and erratic nature of the ongoing activity disruptions. This outlook is backed by the latest 2016 E&P spending surveys, which indicate sharper falls than earlier figures. Global spending reductions in 2016 are now approaching 25%, corresponding to a fall of 40% to 50% in North America and around 20% in the international markets.", "Our first quarter revenue fell 16% sequentially, a figure that represents the second steepest quarterly decline we have seen in this downturn that has now persisted for six straight quarters. Rig activity fell in all parts of the world, as customers further reduced budgets and continued to exert pressure on product and service pricing, while operations also suffered from project delays and job cancellations.", "In North America, revenue fell 25% sequentially, as the U.S. land rig count declined by 31%. By the end of the quarter, the U.S. land rig count had fallen to around 400, representing a drop of 80% from the peak of October 2014, and marking a third phase of a downturn that is the most severe the industry has seen in 30 years.", "The latest fall in activity has been particularly steep, as seen by our North America land revenues, which is 29% lower sequentially on reduced activity and increased pricing pressure, together with the early onset of the Canadian spring breakup. In spite of this downward acceleration in activity, our new technology sales remain solid, and we also see growing customer recognition for the value of our integrated technology offering.", "North America offshore revenue was down 18% sequentially, driven by lower rig activity and project delays and cancellations. In addition, multi-client seismic sales saw unprecedented low levels, resulting in a negative operating income of $36 million in the first quarter, due to the ongoing amortization of our multi-client library. This loss combined with the dramatic drop in activity and continued pricing pressure caused our overall operating margins in North America to fall into negative territory.", "Throughout the quarter, we maintained our focus on tailoring costs and resources to activity levels while safeguarding our operational infrastructure and technical capabilities. Needless to say, this approach further reduced our profitability levels. However, our cash flow in North America still remained positive.", "Turning to the international markets, revenue was 13% lower sequentially, as customer budget cuts, project cancellations, seasonal winter slowdowns, and foreign exchange weakness versus the U.S. dollar all impacted results. Fourth quarter international operating margins slipped to 21%, driven by the significant activity reductions and persistent pricing pressure. The Europe, CIS, and Africa [ECA] area was the worst affected, while the Latin America and the Middle East and Asia [MEA] areas were able to maintain flat margins compared to the fourth quarter. And in total, our international sequential decremental margins improved in the first quarter to 27%.", "Looking at the international areas in more detail, revenue in Latin America declined 9% sequentially while pre-tax operating margins remained steady at 23%, driven by proactive cost management initiated in the previous quarter and the startup of a new integrated project. In Argentina, activity softened further in the first quarter, and revenue was also negatively impacted by the weakening of the peso. Activity in Brazil and Colombia continues to be in freefall and was in the first quarter down 50% and 75% respectively compared to the first quarter of last year. In Ecuador, we are executing well on our SPM projects, with production in Shushufindi exceeding 90,000 barrels per day during the first quarter. And we continue to invest actively in our integration project in the country.", "Revenue in Venezuela was down sequentially, but we did see higher activity in the Faja joint ventures compared to the fourth quarter. In Venezuela, the rate of cash collections has been insufficient in recent quarters. And in spite of concerted efforts together with our main customer, we have been unable to establish new mechanisms that address this issue. Therefore, as we have already announced, we have decided that we will not increase our accounts receivable balance beyond the level reached at the end of the first quarter.", "This means that activity levels in Venezuela going forward will be aligned with the rate of cash collections from our customers in the country. In doing this, we are working in close coordination with all customers in Venezuela to continue to serve the ones with available cash flow and to ensure a safe and orderly wind-down of operations for the others. We have been working in Venezuela since 1929. And in spite of this temporary reduction in activity, we remain committed to the oil and gas industry in the country going forward.", "In Europe, CIS, and Africa, revenues fell 18% sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins dropped by 194 basis points to 19%. The drop in revenue was led by Russia and Central Asia, where a further weakening of the ruble and the seasonal winter slowdown both on land and offshore impacted results. In the North Sea, revenue was also lower due to customer budget cuts, seasonal reductions in activity, and also severe weather conditions, while widespread project delays and job cancellations in sub-Saharan Africa contributed to another significant sequential reduction in revenue in this region.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 11% sequentially while pre-tax operating margins remained flat at 22%. The sequential drop in revenue was led by Asia, with lower activity in China from the seasonal winter slowdown and also by weaker activity in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region as a result of continued customer budget cuts.", "First quarter revenue was also down in the Middle East region, where solid activity in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt was more than offset by reductions in the rest of the region. In terms of operating margins, the lower activity and pricing pressure seen throughout the area was offset by adjustments to our cost and resource base as well as by further implementation of our transformation program.", "Turning now to our technology offering, the Cameron transaction closed on April 1, 2016. And on this date, Cameron became the fourth Schlumberger product group, joining our Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, and Production groups. We are very excited and pleased to welcome the Cameron employees under the leadership of Scott Rowe to Schlumberger. And we are already in full implementation mode of the detailed integration plans we have jointly prepared over the past seven months.", "In terms of financial reporting, Simon has already explained that we will report Cameron financial results as a fourth global group, and also that Cameron's revenue will be consolidated with the rest of the company on a geographical basis under the four reporting areas we currently disclose, while we at the same time will discontinue the geographical reporting of pre-tax operating income.", "So let me explain the reasoning behind this change. First, the Cameron Group is a centrally run manufacturing business built around large plants that address global markets, and their customer billings around the world are largely separated from where the costs are incurred. Combining the Cameron Group revenue with the rest of the company will therefore give a good representation of customer activity for the entire company. However, Cameron has historically not allocated out a large central cost base because managing these allocations are associated with significant extra workloads.", "At the same time the traditional Schlumberger business, although different in nature from Cameron, is also evolving towards a more regional and central setup as part of our ongoing corporate transformation. Our geographical presence from both a customer interaction and well site execution standpoint will never change and will always remain central to how we run the company. However, the overhead structure that is employed to support our day-to-day customer operations represents a significant part of our cost base, which can be dramatically streamlined and reduced through the centralization drive of the transformation program. Schlumberger is therefore also on a path where there is a growing distance between where we bill our customers and where we incur a large part of our costs.", "Based on this, we have therefore decided to discontinue the reporting of pre-tax operating income by the geographical areas. Beyond this, we will continue to report orders and backlog for the Cameron long-cycle businesses, of OneSubsea and Drilling, and for the WesternGeco seismic business.", "Next, let's move on from financial reporting to new technology. The technical driver behind the Cameron transaction is our belief that the Cameron technologies will be critical enablers in the development of a new generation of incubated surface and subsurface systems that have the potential to make a step change in both drilling and production performance. One example of this is our land drilling system of the future that brings together purpose-built surface and downhole hardware, which is ready to be integrated into a complete drilling system, overseen and managed by a common optimization software that will deliver a step change in operational efficiency.", "Cameron brings expertise and technology in the areas of top drives, pipe handling systems, and blowout preventers, while the new system will also draw on the rig design acquisition and rig manufacturing JV we made last year. Five engineering prototypes of the new system will be ready for field testing in 2016 in Ecuador and the U.S., with full commercial introduction on track for 2017.", "Another example is our new hydraulic fracturing system, which will be produced in 2017, where we will bring together new hardware technologies and significant process reengineering as well as a common operating and optimization software. This system will span the complete range of surface components, such as Cameron's CAMSHALE pressure control and wellhead systems together with our own perforating, fracturing, cleanup, and flowback services, as well as our latest downhole completion technology and fracturing fluids.", "Both of these systems will initially be deployed within our current CapEx budget of $2 billion for 2016, which itself has been reduced by $400 million from our initial guidance. Our ability to invest through this unprecedented industry downturn on the back of our strong cash flow and balance sheet enables us to capitalize on the current market conditions to gain significant relative strength compared to our surroundings.", "In addition to our traditional CapEx investments, we also continue to invest in new production management projects, leveraging our broad subsurface and integration capabilities. An example of this is the Auca project we started off in Ecuador during the first quarter, where we are building further on the highly successful Shushufindi project, which is now in its fifth year of operation.", "Multi-client seismic surveys is another line of business opportunities we continue to invest in, where our current focus is on the exciting Campeche Basin in Mexico and the largely unexplored areas offshore Mozambique and South Africa. As we enter the second quarter, we have a total of eight 3D vessels active, and with three of these using our unique IsoMetrix technology.", "We also continue to make M&A investments in niche technologies that fill gaps in our portfolio or in our ability to develop specific new services. We mentioned two of these in today's release, with one being a novel downhole metal-to-metal sealing technology for use in our completions product line, while the other brings expert consulting abilities in support of the expansion of our integrated project portfolio.", "And finally, we continue to focus on returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks, which combined amounted to $1.1 billion in the first quarter.", "Turning now to the short-term outlook, we expect market conditions to worsen further in the second quarter, as customers continue to reduce activity. Excluding the additional revenue from Cameron, this market outlook together with our decision to reduce activity in Venezuela could lead to a sequential percentage fall in revenue for the second quarter, similar to what we saw in Q1. Cameron revenue, on the other hand, is expected to be flat sequentially.", "In this environment, we will continue to tailor service capacity and overhead costs to activity levels while preserving long-term operational and technical capabilities, which could represent a further burden on our operating margins going forward, in particular in North America.", "Our overall view of the oil markets, however, remains unchanged, where a steady tightening of the supply and demand balance is taking place. The latest reports confirm that 2016 demand growth remains solid, while OPEC production levels have been largely flat since the mid of 2015. Production in North America continues to fall as decline rates are becoming more pronounced, while the mature non-OPEC production is now falling in a number of regions.", "As we navigate these landscapes, a number of positive factors make me optimistic and confident with respect to Schlumberger's future. First, the magnitude of the E&P investment cuts are now so severe that it can only accelerate production decline and the consequent upward movement in oil price. Second, our financial strength enables us to continue to invest in a range of opportunities across a number of our businesses. Third, the massive capacity reductions in the service industry will help restore a good part of the international pricing concessions we have made once oil prices and activity levels start to normalize. And last, while we have reduced capacity significantly, we are safeguarding the core expertise and capabilities of the company beyond our immediate operational requirements.", "We therefore remain confident in our ability to weather this downturn much better than our surroundings. Through our global reach, the strength of our technology offering, the strategic moves we have made, and our corporate transformation program, we are creating the leverage that will enable us to increase revenue market share and continue to produce superior earnings and margins.", "Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And we'll go to the line of Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much and thanks for a good rundown there, Paal. Our CapEx numbers agree very closely with those you outlined. But despite that, at least here within Morgan Stanley, we have a pretty big debate about the exact timing and the expected impact of these cuts on production. I think U.S. and the Middle East is getting extremely well understood, but I'd be very grateful if you could share your insights on some of those areas, so the role that have headline rig counts that have gone down 80% \u2013 90% in many cases, but very little data available. So what's your take on what's going on across some of the key Latin American markets or West Africa or let's say China? If you can, give us a high-level \u2013 without mentioning any specific country or customer of course, some insights into what gives you confidence that the markets are rebalancing.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "What I would say, you look at non-OPEC production outside of North America, it is very clear that it's now in full decline. If you look at non-OPEC production overall, it drops by 930,000 barrels over the course of Q1. About 50% of this was North America, and the other half was international non-OPEC. The leading driver outside of the U.S. in terms of this production drop is seen in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, the UK, and in China. So 930,000 barrels of drop over the course of Q1 is quite significant, and non-OPEC production is now already 400,000 barrels a day down year over year.", "So based on this, we believe that the current oversupply is expected to shrink to almost zero by the end of 2016. And in Q4 this year, non-OPEC production is now forecasted to be down 1 million barrels per day year over year. So that basically increases the call on OPEC from today's level to Q4 by 1.8 million barrels a day, which is quite a significant increase. So yes, we believe and I think we agree with you that the oil market is in the process of balancing.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "That does sound like some big numbers. What would it take in your view \u2013 eventually the industry is going to have to go back to work again because once we undershoot on the supply side, prices will take care of that. But what will it take in order to stabilize and grow production again globally given the contraction we've seen, as you highlighted, in service capacity and the lag between investments and \u2013 or lack of investments for that matter and production?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we will need significant increases in E&P investment. There's no way you can get around that. But if you look at the current state of the industry today and you look forward to 2017, there are limited sources of short-term supply that can be brought to the market. What can be done next year is to draw down further on global stocks. There is OPEC spare capacity that can be put into the market. We have the North America land ducts. And if you look at new investments that are relatively short cycle, there are two sources of that. It is going to be the conventional land international, and it's going to be the unconventional land in North America. Both of these resource types are relatively short-cycle businesses, and production coming out of them is just going to be a function of the investment appetite.", "So I think the sources of additional production for 2017 is limited to these items that I just mentioned. And beyond that, I think we need a widespread significant increase in E&P investments to get supply back to where it can meet growing demand.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Ole.", "Operator", "We'll go to the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Your line is open.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning, Paal. In the past you've talked about the massive overcapacity in land service markets and talked about the pricing recovery in the short to medium term looks really difficult. Some of the smaller peers have been talking about stacked capacity permanently impaired in North America, so maybe the market is a little tighter than it looks. So in your mind and as we think about the lag effects that you've talked about here, how does that look for you, the outlook on pricing and how that utilization and the capacity can all work together?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "For North America?", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, in North America. I'm just curious if you think that some of that stacked capacity doesn't come back and how that portends to margins.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it would be great if it didn't come back, but I still think most of it is going to come back. I think some of it today probably isn't operational because it needs maintenance. But I think when activity starts to increase, most of this equipment through some maintenance investment can be brought back in. And that's why I still believe there's a large capacity overhang in North America land. And with the current depressed service pricing, we need significant pricing increases to get back in to generate profits in North America land. And that's why I don't think that pricing traction is going to be significant in the short term, and that's why also I think the earnings contributions from North America land is going to be a bit out in time.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And as we talk about decrementals and how those look for you, your decrementals have held up remarkably well here. But you also talk about preserving your core capabilities. Are we getting to the end of cost-cutting here, and would you expect decrementals to get maybe a little bit worse here before it starts turning the corner?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're right, it is increasingly difficult to maintain decrementals around the 30% mark. We did 32% even with the massive surprise we had in the first quarter. But yes, we are getting to the point where some of our technical capabilities, which take a long time to develop, we are going to revamp those and not cut them to be in line with current activity levels.", "But with that said, on the field capacity, we continue to tailor that to ongoing activity levels. This can be rebuilt within, I would say, plus or minus 12 months. What we are currently undergoing now is a detailed review of our overhead structure to see whether there is an opportunity to bring that further down, but that wouldn't be done to serve the next couple of quarters, it would be basically finding a way that we can lighten that burden more permanently. But to do that, it requires significant review, and that's the process we're currently going through at this stage.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is open.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "So there has been a lot of discussion out in the marketplace about people and the challenges with people. And if you could, give us a little bit of color on what steps you've taken to retain your top talent, both internationally but also more importantly in the U.S., and then your thoughts on your ability to bring these new people back in or bring back your old people back in when things do slowly start to turn around in 2017.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Maybe I can just start by one thing first. So if you look at our reported head count numbers, we reported at the end of Q4 95,000 people, and we reported 93,000 people at this stage, which indicates that we let go another 2,000 people during Q1. We actually released another 8,000 people during the first quarter. So we have now reduced our workforce by around 42,000 people from the peak in 2014. So the delta here is that we are now counting around 5,500 contractors which were previously not considered part of our permanent head count, so a drop of 8,000 in Q1.", "Now to your question around how we are managing this, we are obviously right-sizing field capacity continuously. This capacity, we can build back relatively quickly, probably within 12 months. But even in the field capacity, we have introduced a program called intent of leave of absence. And here for our senior field engineers and for key operational people, we are giving them basically half an annual salary, paid 20% up front when they take this leave of absence, and 30% of the salary is paid when they return back after 12 months. And we have several batches of this incentivized leave of absence where we can call people back in the coming 12 to 18 months. So that's a key part of how we preserve some of our core operational expertise.", "And then on the overhead and support structure, we continue to look at right-sizing that. But in this, our technical support organization, which takes a long time to develop, we are also ring fencing that to take sure that we have these people available as we get back into growth mode.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Okay, that was very helpful. And then you mentioned and you gave a little bit of color on your preservation of your core capabilities, but also a greater willingness to balance market share with profitability. Maybe a little bit more color there, particularly on the U.S. but internationally as well, and you referenced obviously still some pressure on revenues and margins going into Q2. And can you talk a little bit more how that plays out for the next quarter or two on the margin side?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Q2 is going to be another very tough quarter. So the significant drop in activity that we saw during the first quarter is obviously now spilling over into Q2. In addition to that, we're going to have the impact on Venezuela to deal with. So again, we are expecting a significant percentage drop in revenue going into Q2, which again will make it difficult or challenging to maintain decremental margins around 30%, although we are going to continue to try.", "What we see in certain markets and certain basins in North America and also certain markets international, that activity is coming down to basically critical mass type of levels. And at that stage, it is not only about focusing in on cost reductions and managing margins. We are also considering what the startup costs again would be in the event we have to shut everything down. So in certain cases, we are carrying, I would say, contracts and operations losses for certain regions where we believe that's a better investment than actually shutting down and then having the lag in time and significant costs to start things back up again. But this is a review we do for every country or every basin on a continuous basis, what's the benefit of taking the losses versus shutting down and then making the investments later on to start back up again.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Great, that was actually very helpful. Thank you, Paal.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Angie.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "James West - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "James West - Evercore ISI", "So I don't think we have much of a debate here at Evercore ISI on the structure of oil prices, but I'd love to get your thoughts on prices given that you've said recently in public documents you're looking at medium-for-longer. I guess what do you see as medium-for-longer? And then my follow-up would be what does that mean for activity improving for your businesses?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Our view on the medium-for-longer or the background for that statement is that I think that is the pricing level that the industry has and has to live with, and it's probably the pricing level that some of the core parts of OPEC is also believing is a reasonable target, although they have not told us, so that is our assumption. So in that environment, there is still a big jump for the industry to make sure that we can bring cost per barrel down to make projects viable in these pricing ranges as well as having enough projects to generate supply to meet future demand.", "So it is an opportunity for a company like ourselves to work closely with our customers in collaborative ways, where we look at jointly with them driving costs out of the system and production up from the assets that they have. And I think by having this focus, there is an opportunity for the industry to be quite successful in the medium-for-longer scenario. But we cannot continue to operate in the same way that we have done in the past. So we see significant opportunity for Schlumberger in that type of scenario, but it requires the industry to change both in the level of collaboration between customers and the service industry, as well as new investments in more efficient processes, better quality, and very importantly, total system innovation to drive performance.", "James West - Evercore ISI", "Paal, are you seeing that collaboration come through during this down cycle? Are you seeing more evidence from your customers to actually collaborate more with you?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "There are some signs of it, James, but I wouldn't say it's prevalent or significant at this stage. We are obviously very interested in starting it. We have some small projects going on with some key customers. In fairness to our customers as well, they are in a very, I would say, significant cash crunch at this stage, in which case the priority for them would have to be to navigate that through before they start changing their business model. But I think there is an openness and willingness when things settle here to move in towards more collaborative relationships, and we are certainly ready to lead that.", "James West - Evercore ISI", "Got it. Thanks, Paal.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "A little bit of a shift, I figure that about 25% to 30% of your operating income these days are coming from offshore and primarily deepwater work. And I'm in Washington at the NOIA [National Ocean Industries Association] meeting. And the consensus here seems to be that deepwater is going to decline or at least not begin to recover for at least the next couple years. You all have given us a great deal of view and guidance on the onshore outlook. Can you talk a little bit about the offshore outlook?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's fair to say that in terms of significant new projects being sanctioned offshore, I think that is not going to be the first area that our customers are going to start putting money into. So I think it's fair to say that the land part of the global operations will see higher investments before the offshore, and in particular the deepwater part.", "Now as to the percentage of our revenue and earnings, we haven't disclosed what deepwater and offshore is. But I would say that the current operating income we're getting from this part of our business is I would say significantly or massively reduced from what it was in more of a stable operating environment in 2014. So a lot of these hits I believe we have already taken. It still means that we have upside potential when these investments start. But we also have a very good presence, both in North America land and even more so in the international land conventional market.", "So in any situation where the investments are coming, and they would have to come, we are very well positioned to capture our share of them and generate earnings growth from the onset of the increase. And then the offshore and deepwater comes later on and exploration coming after that. We have several new phases that can spur our growth in the coming two, three, four years.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, Paal, I appreciate that. And my follow-up if I could, when we talk about international conventional and domestic unconventional, it would appear just from customer spending patterns that onshore U.S. and the independents will probably come back first. Will there be much of a delay, and if so, how much between the recovery in North America and the recovery on international conventional land?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a good question, Jim. I think if you go on historical ways of responding, I think it's right to say that in previous small and large downturns, the North American players have been quicker and had more investment appetite to grow fast. I think the situation at this stage is somewhat different. There is a potential significant supply challenge over the next couple of years, and part of this will have to be addressed through international increased supply.", "So I think a number of the players within the Middle East, I think Russia land and Russian Siberia all have the capacity I think to invest more and have a short-cycle impact on production. Now whether they will do that or not I think is still to be seen. But I think given the potential challenges of supply, I don't think North America by itself is going to be able to handle it. It would have to come from other sources as well, in which case I think this time around you would probably see a faster response, in my view, from the international conventional land businesses as well.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons. Your line is open.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International", "Thank you, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International", "Paal, I was curious as to your views with regard to the threshold oil price required to drive 2017 international E&P capital spending growth.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's going to be gradual. I don't think there's going to be one magical number.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think oil prices now for Brent being already in the mid-$40s is a positive sign. Still, we maintain our view that there's going to be a lag between oil price and increases and significant increases in E&P spend. And I think our customers will take a cautious view on how much they're going to spend as well, given the balance sheet state of many of them and also the significant volatility that you might also see going forward.", "So I think you will see a gradual comeback of investments as oil prices increase, we believe, over the course of the second half of this year. And then it's going to be I think a function maybe of how severe the supply situation is going to be. I think that might be a good guide in addition to the movement of the oil price because if supply is clearly weakening, I think it's going to be much safer to increase investments going forward as well, in which case the appetite might come up together with the oil price. So I think our customers will take a balanced but conservative view initially. And I think the appetite might increase as we see how severe the impact on supply is going to be as the rest of this year evolves.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International", "I guess the question is that in the event that we continue to get an improvement in oil prices, although the rate of improvement slows over the back half of the year, that it begins to crystallize that we're on a sustainable path to recovery. Do we need considerably higher oil prices from this point to drive decent E&P capital spending growth internationally in 2017, or is it sufficient that we're on a recovery path and resource holders continue to believe that the direction is higher and not lower?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's difficult to generalize, but I think your statement around the path I think is going to be critical as well, the path of supply and the path of movement of oil price. Like I said, it's difficult to come up with one specific number. I think the various customer groups and the customers within these groups will have different views on when they are getting comfortable to invest. But I would think both aspects, the oil price movement and the supply trends, is probably what they're going to look at when they make decisions. But overall, as I said earlier on the call, E&P investments will have to come up in order to address the supply challenges we'll see in 2017 and onwards.", "William Herbert - Simmons & Co. International", "Okay, thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Paal, you had mentioned that international pricing concessions that you've given would start to go away as oil prices rise. I guess that's what you said. Would we start to see that at $60 per barrel Brent, or do we need higher prices to see those pricing concessions go away?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I wouldn't tie it to a specific oil price. I would more tie it to activity levels. I think that's what's going to drive our pricing. And that's again, we see a lag between the move in oil price and E&P investments and our activity. But I think if there is a start of a third or at least a noticeable uptick in international activity, I think some of these pricing concessions that have been made, we should be able to get part of them back. And in fact, in many of our contracts, the concessions we have made are either time-limited or they are tied to oil price figures as well. So based on all of this, we believe that some of the pricing at least we will get back.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, great, and then secondly, my follow-up on your SPM investments. How are the returns on your SPM investments relative to the overall corporate returns? Are they higher or lower? And then how does that differential change through the cycle?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Simon?", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I'm going to take this question, Waqar. So normally, our SPM investments and our review of these projects, they are superior to our normal activity. That's the reason why we have developed this type of business, and it is even during the cycles it's giving us a baseline of activity that produces higher margins and higher returns. But you have to remember that this is a long-term project. And in the beginning the model, that it is a negative cash flow, which turns into a positive cash flow after a while. So over a cycle, yes, it is better return and better margins.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Now you mentioned almost $600 million in the quarter in SPM. What are your plans for the remainder of this year in terms of SPM investments?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think if you look at both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year, SPM investments have been higher than what you've seen before, and we expect the second quarter to go back into more of a level that you've seen preceding these two latest quarters.", "Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Paal, if I could ask you, you mentioned briefly in your prepared comments that you could \u2013 the way the market is going, you could see revenue in the second quarter potentially decline by the same amount as the first quarter. It sounds like Latin America, it would stand to reason, could be worse because of Venezuela. Would you see a material difference amongst the regions in revenue decline to get to the same percentage decline, or is there more of a shift to one area or the other in terms of the decline in revenue from 1Q to 2Q?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think if you look at the four areas, we'll see again a significant drop in North America, purely based on how the rig count has fared over the course of Q1. In Latin America, as you point out, we will have a significant impact on Venezuela, where we are in the process of tailoring activity to the rate of collections, which will mean a fairly significant drop in activity in Venezuela in Q2.", "And just for the record, I'd just like to also say that our receivable balance in Venezuela at the end of the first quarter was around $1.2 billion, and our revenue in Venezuela was less than 5% of the total for the first quarter and also for the full year of last year, just to give you some perspective of the situation there.", "Then going to ECA and to MEA, I don't have the details of the projections there, but I think you would see a similar type of revenue headwinds also going into the second quarter there as well.", "Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess trying to think about decremental margins on a similar revenue decline, do we think we can perhaps get a little bit better decrementals, or does Venezuela cause decrementals to maybe deteriorate a little bit from what you were able to do in the first quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We've laid out the ambition of trying to keep decrementals around 30% since the start of this downturn, which was a lot easier to do five, six quarters ago than what it is to do currently. And obviously, when you have shutdown of significant operations in a large country like Venezuela, it is much more difficult to deal with because, for instance, in Venezuela, we are going to keep a large part of our local organization employed and on the payroll as we go forward. And also we keep our entire asset base in the country to make sure that we are ready to go back and serve our customers there once cash flow is available to pay us.", "So there are certain of these decisions that we are making now which are somewhat headwinds to decrementals, but I would say that our ambition is still to try to fight this out and deliver at least close to 30% decrementals, although I cannot promise it.", "Judson E. Bailey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you, Paal. Appreciate it.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great rundown so far, Paal. I was wondering. You mentioned two things about the international, the call on international oil coming from the international markets, part of that coming from OPEC and then you also indicated Russia. Can you give us a little bit more color around Russia? There seems to be a lot of discussion in the marketplace that neither Russia nor Saudi in particular can increase output from where they are currently. Your comments seem to counter that viewpoint. So can you just give us some views on Russia in particular?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think if you look at Russia throughout this downturn, activity has been very strong, and they have done a good job from the oil industry in the country to keep production up between 10.5 million and 11 million barrels per day. So in spite of the challenges we have in Russia with the ruble and then the overall situation there, we've seen strong underlying activity and a very strong focus from the country and from the industry in the country to maintain and even try to increase production slightly. So I think through higher investments, obviously Russia has significant oil and gas reserves. And to increase investments, if there's an appetite to do that, I still think Russia has the potential to increase production yet going forward.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And I think to your comment on Saudi as well, obviously Saudi is sitting on several million barrels of spare capacity, which they can put into the market if they so choose to.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great, and then just a quick follow-up on Cameron. I fully understand your business plan and business model on integrating the hardware with the reservoir dynamics. What has been the uptake on that? Have you had some definitive successes on selling that business model to the oil companies as of yet?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's still early days on that. I think the overall concept I think is widely accepted. This whole focus on total system innovation going forward, combining hardware with sensors, instrumentation, and software controls, this is the way of the future for the industry.", "So I still think it's early days. We are seeing some traction in OneSubsea, which has obviously been at this for several years already, and also things around the Rig of the Future system I explained. I think it will be quite interesting when we also roll out our new frac system in 2017. So we have a lot of investments already going on, which means that it's not going to be years before you see the impact of what we are talking about. I think I would expect there to be already some impact in 2016 and even more so in 2017 to introduce these new technology systems.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right, that's great. Appreciate that color.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have time for one last question, and that will be from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes. Thanks for squeezing me in and good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Paal, in the release you highlighted that you're cautious regarding adding capacity in North America once recovery begins, which I think you highlighted reflects a cautious stance regarding your views towards long-term oversupply and hence profitability. But on the other hand, it appears that you have a good ability to take share in the U.S. given the financial stress being experienced by your smaller competitors. Can you just walk through that strategy a little bit more regarding balancing market share on U.S. land and expanding the U.S. business at what initially would be thin margins? Why not be aggressive during the initial recovery in terms of reactivating equipment to take share and then have greater share when profitability levels can improve later on?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That's a fair question. I would say our general philosophy is that we do like not like contracts that are dilutive to earnings. So basically, losing money isn't something that we ideally want to get into. Now we take on contracts at this stage of the cycle that are dilutive to earnings per share if we believe that doing that is going to serve us long term either from a share standpoint or from keeping our capabilities intact as we work through the trough of the cycle.", "So in terms of being cautious and adding back capacity, if we are talking about being in the black and basically making profits, I have no issues at all releasing capacity and going for share. But if the share is associated with negative earnings, that's when we're going to be cautious and we're going to stick to basically preserving capabilities and infrastructure as long as pricing levels are at that stage. But I think as soon as you get into the black, we are quite keen to unleash all of the capacity we have available to gain share.", "Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And then it's my understanding that those frac crews in the U.S. are underutilized today even when active. Do you have an idea of roughly how much more you can expand your frac workload in the U.S. without actually reactivating spreads?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The spreads we have today are actually quite well utilized because if you have \u2013 with the current pricing levels, if you have poor utilization on top of it, it is a disaster from a profitability standpoint. So the fleets we have in operations are actually today reasonably well utilized. So there might be some upside in capacity on it, but I wouldn't say significant. We would have to reactivate new capacity in order to take on significantly more work.", "Scott A. Gruber - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great, thanks.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the most important points that we discussed. First, our industry is now in the deepest financial crisis on record, with profitability and cash flow at unsustainable levels for most oil and gas operators. This has created an equally dramatic situation for the service industry. Each successive quarter for the past 18 months has brought increasing cost in E&P spend that have led to falling activity and lower demand for oilfield products and services. This is the toughest environment we have seen for 30 years, and it is likely to get even tougher before the market turns.", "Second, so far in this downturn, we have successfully managed a very challenging commercial landscape by balancing margins against market share and aggressively reducing capacity and overhead costs. In parallel, we continue to focus on how to best preserve the long-term technical capabilities of the company. This approach together with the benefits of our ongoing transformation program has enabled us to outperform our surroundings and protect our financial strength.", "And third, the current market presents significant opportunities for companies that have both the required capital and strategic bandwidth that enables them to invest. In this respect so far in this downturn, we have closed our largest ever acquisition, made a series of smaller but still significant investments in specific technology niches, and invested in integrated services and projects that will boost our financial performance going forward. We are also actively investing in pre-funded multi-client seismic surveys that will underpin a return to solid exploration activity in several regions around the world. And we also regard the protection of our technical capabilities as well as our immediate operational needs as an investment in our future growth.", "In summary, we remain convinced that the tightening of the supply/demand balance is well underway. And while the operating environment remains tough, the market presents a range of opportunities which we will continue to actively pursue. Thank you very much for listening in today.", "Operator", "Thank you. And, ladies and gentlemen, today's teleconference will be available for replay after 10:00 AM today until midnight, May 22.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2016 Results Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from London following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group. Scott will join the earnings call through the fourth quarter this year to provide an update on the Cameron Group business integration and synergies.", "Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Scott will provide the Cameron update, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involves risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.", "Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements. Please make your questions concise and limit them to one related follow-up.", "I'll now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.23. This represents decreases of $0.17 sequentially and $0.65 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the second quarter, we recorded $2.9 billion of pre-tax charges. This consisted of $1.9 billion of asset impairments, $646 million relating to workforce reductions, and $355 million of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of Cameron which closed on April 1, 2016. The asset impairments are a result of the challenging market condition that continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2016. These impairments will not result in any cash outflows.", "As we indicated last quarter, we continued to tailor our resources to activity levels, unfortunately, this resulted in additional workforce reductions. The $335 million of merger and integration charges consists of $150 million non-cash inventory-related purchase accounting item, with the balance relating to transaction costs as well as a dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies. We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017.", "Our second-quarter revenue was $7.2 billion. This included a full quarter of activity from Cameron which added $1.5 billion to our top line. Excluding the impact of Cameron, revenue decreased 14% sequentially reflecting continued activity declines, pricing pressure and a reduction of activity in Venezuela to better match cash collections.", "Pre-tax operating margins, including the effects of Cameron, decreased 404 basis points, sequentially, to 10.4%. Cameron was accretive to Schlumberger's pre-tax operating margin as well as earning per share and cash flow.", "Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially, while margin decreased 228 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were largely driven by Wireline and Testing Services activity declines across all of the international areas, most notably in Latin America. Drilling Group revenue of $2 billion decreased 18% sequentially while margin declined 649 basis points. These decreases were primarily driven by significant rig count reductions and pricing pressure across all areas, the largest declines were experienced in Latin America and North America.", "Production Group revenue of $2.1 billion decreased 11% sequentially and margins fell by 459 basis points, primarily on lower pressure pumping activity and further pricing pressure in North America land. Latin America also saw significant activity declines.", "As previously mentioned, the Cameron Group contributed revenue of $1.5 billion while generating pre-tax operating margin of 15.8%. On a pro forma basis, this represents a 6% sequential revenue decline and 130 basis points margin improvement.", "The decrease in revenue was largely driven by a declining project backlog as well as the further slowdown in U.S. land that impacted the shorter cycle businesses. The margin improvement was driven by strong project execution, offset in part by the effects of the activity decline in U.S. land.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole. Our corporate and other expense line has increased $69 million sequentially. This increase is driven by the $63 million of the quarterly amortization expense from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the Cameron purchase accounting. The Schlumberger effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 16% in the second quarter essentially the same as Q1.", "As I highlighted last quarter with these reduced overall levels of pre-tax income that we are experiencing, relatively small changes in our tax line will have a disproportionate impact on our ETR potentially resulting in volatility going forward. Our tax rate will continue to be very sensitive to the overall geographic mix of earnings.", "We generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations. This is despite paying approximately $285 million in severance and $100 million in one-off transaction related fees during the quarter.", "Our net debt increased $3.4 billion during the quarter to $10 billion. This expected increase was driven by the $2.8 billion of cash we paid the Cameron shareholders and the $785 million of net debt we assumed in connection with the transaction. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $11.6 billion.", "During the quarter, we spent $31 million to repurchase 428,000 shares at an average price of $72.77. Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $450 million on CapEx, $130 million of SPM investments, $170 million of multiclient and $630 million of dividend payments.", "Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1 billion, which includes one quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the second half of 2016 is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion. These amounts do not include investment in SPM or multiclient.", "And now I will turn the conference call over to Scott.", "Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited", "Thanks, Simon, and hello, everyone. This is the first earnings conference call that I have participated in since the announcement of Schlumberger and Cameron combination in August of last year. So I'm going to provide an update on Cameron's key developments in 2016 and provide you with some color on how the integration is progressing.", "The Cameron business has continued perform well in light of current market conditions. The margin progression journey that we started in 2014 has continued in our long cycle businesses with strong execution of our backlog in our Drilling, OneSubsea and Process Systems business units.", "We have continued to deliver our backlog while driving cost out of the system, generating enhanced margins through the cycle. For example, drilling margins were significantly accretive, and subsea margins were at the Cameron Group margin level.", "As you can imagine, our shorter cycle businesses, Surface and Valves & Measurement are being impacted by both volume and significant pricing pressure. Despite these pressures, both Valves & Measurement and Surface have positive operating income and are delivering solid cash flow.", "Overall, the Cameron Group was able to deliver healthy cash flow and operating margins of 15.8% in the quarter, which is nearly an all-time high for Cameron. However, the Cameron Group is not immune to the downturn, as you can see in our second quarter book to bill ratio of 0.68x. This will have a continued impact on revenue in 2017 as our longer cycle businesses continue to move downward and our backlog reduced to $3.7 billion in these businesses at the end of the quarter.", "Let's switch to our business unit level detail starting with OneSubsea. OneSubsea continues to build on the vision that we created when forming the venture in 2013. In fact, we've just been awarded Woodside's Greater Enfield development, which is truly the first award that brings together the full capabilities that OneSubsea has to offer. This will be booked in July.", "We have been working closely with Woodside since we were awarded their subsea frame agreement in 2014. Our success in the frame agreement evolved to an integrated FEED study which led to project award. In this project we used our integrated solutions expertise, including flow assurance capabilities, our systems engineering to best configure the seafloor architecture, our seafloor boosting capabilities, our standardized horizontal SpoolTree, and subsea landing string. We are very pleased to be working with Woodside and finding cost-effective solutions to move deepwater developments from concept to reality.", "With these engagements, the OneSubsea team continues to move up the learning curve on how to find deepwater solutions that are one, cost enabling; two, deliver more production at a higher recovery factor; three, bring projects to market significantly faster; and ultimately, improve the financial returns of deepwater developments.", "We are also working on the SPS and SURF interface where we believe there are cost and efficiency gains. We now have three paid FEED studies for our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance, and we're working on another 20-plus engagements currently.", "Other recent activities include the six tree award for Pterobel's Zohr gas development in Egypt, which utilized a quick FEED approach and a supplier-led solution to meet a very aggressive timeline at a significantly reduced cost.", "Additionally, OneSubsea has successfully commissioned two boosting systems in the Gulf of Mexico. OneSubsea continues to have 100% of the working seafloor boosting systems in the world. Our leadership and history in boosting positions OneSubsea extremely well to capitalize on the smaller developments that tie back to existing infrastructure and whose facilities. Our unique offering of a single well-boosting system combined with a standard subsea tree works perfectly for this growing market.", "Each of the Cameron businesses are handling this cycle well in executing on our downturn playbook which focused on cost reduction, market share preservation and price optimization. As we move into Schlumberger, we are sharpening our focus on our service offering to capitalize on our large global installed base of equipment, and we continue to enhance our portfolio with a renewed commitment to technology. I can't tell you how proud I am of the Cameron employees as we continue to perform exceptionally well despite the industry's worst downturn and while executing a major corporate integration.", "Now, I'd like to turn to the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger. To start, I think it can be best summarized as a successful continuation of the collaboration and partnership that we started in OneSubsea. The Cameron and Schlumberger teams continue to work together in an impressive manner, and I'm happy to report that the progress in the first three months has exceeded all of our expectations. In the second quarter, we booked $125 million of synergy-related business, which was significantly ahead of our original plan. We are also on track to deliver the $300 million of synergies in the first 12 months from closing.", "We continue to find unexpected opportunities across all of the Cameron businesses, including Valves & Measurement and Processing, as we leverage the substantial capabilities of Schlumberger's vast geographic organization. Additionally, we continue to build on the concept of integrating the subsurface capabilities of Schlumberger with the surface pressure control and processing capabilities of Cameron. We started this in OneSubsea and we are now seeing opportunities in drilling, unconventional production and production and processing facilities. Finally, we have started over 30 new technology development programs as part of the integration and we are confident that these programs will deliver significant revenue synergies and growth opportunities when the markets do recover.", "Overall, the integration is progressing very well and the combination and collaboration has been positively received by the Cameron employees, the Schlumberger employees and our customers.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, market condition worsened further in most parts of our global operations. But in spite of the continuing operational and commercial headwinds, we have now reached the bottom of the cycle. In line with the previous six quarters of this downturn, we continue to navigate the challenging environment with an unwavering focus on protecting the overall financial health of the company. This enabled us to generate a positive operating income of $747 million, excluding credits and charges; maintain operating margins north of 10%; and, more importantly, produce a positive operating cash flow of $1.6 billion. This solid financial performance came as a result of strong execution and in some cases at the expense of revenue, as we now have started to shift focus onto recovering our pricing concessions and high-grading our contract portfolio.", "Second quarter revenue increased 10% sequentially, boosted by the inclusion of a full quarter's activity for the Cameron Group, which amounted to $1.5 billion. However, activity for all groups decreased in the quarter as E&P budgets were further reduced. The revenue headwinds were most pronounced in North America and further exacerbated by a decision to reduce our operations in Venezuela to fall in line with cash collections, which had a significant impact on our Latin America results. In terms of pre-tax operating income, close to 75% of our sequential drop was caused by North America and Venezuela.", "As I review the second quarter geographical trends, I will use pro forma numbers for the sequential comparison while I focus my comments on the Characterization, Drilling and Production Groups as Scott has already covered the Cameron Group in detail.", "In North America, revenue declined 20% sequentially against an average drop in the U.S. land rig count to 25%, as the activity slide now have reached bottom. The doubling in the WTI oil price since the lows seen in January of this year has also led some customers to start moving drilled but uncompleted shale wells out of inventory and into production, with the associated increase in hydraulic fracturing activity.", "In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity was weaker as additional deepwater exploration rigs were released and the move to development activity slowed. Pricing remained under massive pressure in all land and offshore markets in North America. However, signs have started to emerge of customers recognizing that pricing levels have now fallen to unsustainable levels, leading to a growing risk of destroying capabilities and capacity required in the future.", "Within our North America business, the Drilling Group was the hardest hit in the second quarter with Drilling & Measurements, Bits and Drilling Tools, and M-I SWACO seeing the greatest activity decline.", "In Reservoir Characterization, however, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partly offset by sequentially stronger WesternGeco work in both Canada and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.", "In the international markets customer budget cuts, activity disruptions, seasonal variations and persisting pricing pressure impacted our results in most basins and market segments around the world.", "In Latin America, revenue declined 26% sequentially as activity in Venezuela fell significantly following our decision to reduce operations to fall in line with cash collections. This program is managed in close coordination with all customers in the country and operations are continuing for the Faja IOC joint ventures and for some specific PDVSA operations.", "Activity also decreased in Mexico and Brazil as customer budgets were curtailed further, leaving the remaining activity rig count in these two countries at very low levels. From a technology standpoint, the Drilling Group saw the largest drop in revenue with significant reductions in all product lines.", "In the Production Group, lower revenue from our traditional product lines was offset by robust integration-related performance with all our projects in the region progressing well.", "In Reservoir Characterization our multiclient seismic program in Mexico continued in advance of the upcoming deepwater license rounds.", "So far we have delivered more than 40,000 square kilometers of high resolution wide-azimuth seismic data, and early evaluation of the data is already leading to clearer identification on new exploration plays in the Golfo Campeche (sic) [Golfo de Campeche] Basin.", "Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa declined 7% sequentially as widespread activity reductions throughout our Sub-Saharan Africa operations had a significant impact on our results. Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea saw the largest fall, but the rig count in Angola also fell sharply together with Central/West Africa where key exploration campaign was completed.", "In the North Sea, rig-related activity in the UK increased while revenue was lower in Norway as seasonal shutdowns and a changing job mix impacted results. These negative factors affected all parts of our business in the area and particularly the Drilling and Production Groups. Within Reservoir Characterization, lower revenue for Wireline and Testing Services was partially offset by improving seismic revenues from WesternGeco.", "In Russia, revenue increased as the summer season ramped up in line with expectations and was further supported by the appreciation of the Russian ruble. Activity was strongest for Drilling & Measurements and Well Services, driven by solid drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity both on land and shallow offshore.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue declined by 2% sequentially as lower activity in Asia more than offset strong activity in the Middle East. In Asia, activity was weakest in the Malaysia and Australia GeoMarkets as projects were canceled or completed and the offshore rig count dropped further. The Drilling Group was most affected by this through lower demand for Drilling & Measurements and M-I SWACO technologies, while Reservoir Characterization was also lower on weaker wireline exploration activity.", "In the Middle East, strength in the GCC countries offset weakness in the Iraq, Oman and Egypt GeoMarkets. In Kuwait, increased rig count, continued progress on the early production facilities we are building for the Jurassic project, together with higher artificial lift and completions product sales drove revenue higher. While in Saudi Arabia, activity also increased driven by market share gains from the latest rig allocations as well as higher hydraulic fracturing activity.", "I would now like to turn to the state of our industry and also how we continue to position Schlumberger in the forefront of a challenging and evolving operating environment. We are now seven quarters into the most severe industry downturn on record, which saw oil prices tumbling to $27 this January. Since then, we have seen a slow but steady increase in oil prices as the market data continues to show a tightening of the supply and demand balance, and with the outlook clearly suggesting that these trends will further accelerate going forward.", "While the current level of oil prices have created unprecedented turmoil throughout our industry, the financial challenges that have now become very visible are really nothing new. For some time, there has been a growing shortfall of both profits and cash flow for many oil producers around the world, as the cost of developing increasingly complex oil resources has outgrown the value created, which could be seen even when oil prices were at $100 per barrel. The dramatic restructuring of the supply side we are currently experiencing has just accelerated and amplified the cost, quality and efficiency problems of the industry and led to a more acute cash and profitability crisis.", "The operators have reacted to this crisis by initiating a massive reduction in oilfield activity and by sending unsustainable pricing shock throughout the entire oil industry supply chain. In addition, there is currently also a widespread high-grading of activity taking place in the industry aimed at maximizing short-term production and cash flow.", "Adding up all of this, the current cost per barrel for the oil producers now appears to be significantly lower than what was the case seven quarters ago. However, this should not be confused with a permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance as there has been little to no fundamental change in technology, quality or efficiency, no major step change in industry collaboration and no general transformation of the industry business model.", "What has taken place over the past 21 months is, instead, a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously sitting mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supplier industry even after a massive reduction of costs and capacity.", "So where does this lead the industry? First of all, assuming that we continue to see a steady growth in demand, we are heading towards a significant global supply deficit as the E&P spend rate now is down by more than 50%. The effect of the reduced E&P spend is already clearly visible in the 2016 non-OPEC production numbers, which are set to drop by 900,000 barrels per day versus last year, and can also be seen by the weakness in the OPEC production outside of the Gulf countries. And as the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline.", "In addition, the market is also underestimating the potential reaction from the supplier industry, which has temporarily accepted financially unviable contracts to support the operators and to keep their options open as the downturn has deepened and extended into uncharted territory. This is seen by the service industry profit levels and also from their ballooning receivables balances caused by operators who are unable or unwilling to provide timely payments.", "It also means that, inevitably, service industry pricing has to recover and as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P investment increases intended for additional activity which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit.", "So how are we navigating this challenging industry environment? To start with, we believe that the chronic shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the oil industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance. This has to begin with the transformation of the intrinsic quality and efficiency of each industry player but it also requires the design of much broader technology systems, including both innovative hardware as well as high-level software control systems.", "In addition, we believe that the future industry winners will be the companies that can more effectively integrate the entire industry value chain through an open and collaborative business model with much better commercial alignment between the key contributing parties. After seven quarters of managing our business in an increasingly complex industry environment where we have made a series of strategic and tactical moves, we are well advanced in shaping and positioning our company for future success as can be seen by the following facts.", "First, our balance sheet remains strong with more than $11 billion in cash and short-term investments. And we are also one of the few companies in the industry that still generates a positive free cash flow after actively reinvesting in our business and steadily returning cash to our shareholders in form of dividends and stock buybacks.", "Second, we have an unprecedented global technology offering that we have significantly expanded in past 21 months through the purchase of a number of smaller technology companies as well as the major acquisition of Cameron.", "Third, the addition of the Cameron Group to our technology portfolio will enable the development of major integrated technology systems including our land drilling system and future hydraulic fracturing system and a new surface production system that combines processing, measurements and control.", "Fourth, we have established a range of tiered integration business models that enable us to evolve our customer engagements as well as the type of contracts we take on. And last, the benefits we are seeing from our transformation program are creating a significant and long-term competitive advantage to a steady improvement in our internal intrinsic performance.", "In Schlumberger, we continue to have a stated goal of serving all customers in all basins and countries around the world, provided it is permissible by local and international law, that it's safe for our people and assets, and that it is financially viable.", "And as oil prices have doubled since the lows in January, we have now shifted our focus from decremental margins and increasing our tender win rates over to our contract portfolio, where we are looking to recover the temporary pricing concessions we have made or renegotiate those contracts which, at present, show no promise of becoming financially viable.", "As we now enter a new phase of the cycle, oilfield activity has to increase in most countries around the world for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. The sustainability of this activity recovery will be defined by the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain, which will vary significantly from country to country. And in places where the total value chain remains in a chronic financial shortfall, the increase in activity will not be sustainable.", "A key question in this respect is the sustainability of a North American land recovery where the cumulative industry earnings and free cash flow was negative over the last cycle. And given the resulting financial state of the value chain in this commoditized market, a large wave of cost inflation from every part of the supplier industry is now building, which the E&P companies will have to absorb in parallel with implementing their activity growth plans.", "As we now enter the next phase of the cycle, the breadth and depth of our technology offering, together with our geographical scale and our knowledge of the financial viability of the industry value chain in each operating country will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward.", "In preparation for the next phase, we have already reenergized our management team and formulated detailed plans for how we will navigate this new environment. And as part of this, we have set ourselves a companywide goal on delivering incremental margins higher than 65% on the forthcoming activity growth.", "The combination of the tactical and strategic moves we have made and are continuing to make has enabled us to navigate the challenging industry environment better than most, and above all, will ensure that Schlumberger continues to remain at the absolute forefront of an industry that is set to undergo significant change in the coming years.", "That concludes my remarks. We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Okay. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Good morning, guys. Paal, after...", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, James.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "...after that discussion on the future of the global industry, which was nothing short of very impressive, I feel bad asking such pedestrian questions as I have but I'll give it a shot. You talk about pricing and sustainability and the unsustainable pricing that we have, investor focus today seems definitely to be on North America because the expectation it's going to recover first. And in North America, the biggest concern still seems to be on pressure pumping. And historically, you guys would improve your margins by increasing utilization of equipment, and that would be the first big run in improving your margins and then pricing would follow at some point in the future as utilization got higher.", "You talk about how things are different this time. Can you talk about your outlook for what happens in the U.S. pressure pumping market, how fast pricing comes back, how you will be able to get pricing and what will cause that pricing improvement ahead of some of your peers? I guess that's more of a technology versus commodity discussion. But can you walk us through, just on a regional basis, if you would, your outlook on how pressure pumping utilization and pricing evolve over the next year or two?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's quite a broad question, Jim, but I would say that we are clear that we have reached the bottom of activity in North America land, and that activity will increase not in a V shape dramatic fashion but I think there will be a steady increase in rig counts and associated frac activity, both from the rigs as from wells coming out of the DUC inventory.", "Now again, I think the activity will be more slow and steady. And obviously, with higher utilization, there is some contribution to margins. But margins are deeply negative and I would say at this stage, more activity at the current margin level is just going to be dilutive to earnings. So I think most companies now will be looking for price increases and, in fact, significant price increases actually to bring profitability back to breakeven and into positive territory before that activity is particularly attractive in terms of driving earnings back to previous year's levels.", "So how do we get the pricing? I think, obviously, technology, efficiency, managing supply chain is going to be important, but I think overall, the entire value chain in North America is highly stressed. As I indicated, in the previous cycle, it's cumulatively negative both on profits and free cash flow so I don't think there is an open-ended dramatic improvement at hand without doing anything.", "I think technology has to play a very important role in this. We've said in many foras that if you look at the cost per well, I think we are in late innings, but in terms of production per well, we are in very early innings. And if you want to drive down cost per barrel, we have to look at ways of getting more production out of each well. But \u2013 although utilization will help but given the pain that the entire industry value chain is in, there's going to be a mounting wave of cost inflation from every supplier in that chain, which I think is going to put significant pressure on how quickly activity can recover.", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "That's very helpful. And my follow-up if I could, you mentioned Canada and the Gulf of Mexico and offshore Mexico in terms of WesternGeco, exploration has been in the ditch for the last two and a half years and from the sound of it, WesternGeco appeared to have a very good quarter. Should we see this as the beginning of some level of recovery in seismic and in exploration overall?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would love to say yes to that but I think it's unfortunately premature. I would complement WesternGeco on actually doing a very good job in gaining market share and getting projects which are financially viable, driven again by technology and how well they execute. They've also been good at positioning ourselves in terms of multiclient activity where we continue to get good pre-funding. But I would say there is no immediate, I would say, dramatic comeback in exploration or in seismic in particular, but within the context of a very depressed market, WesternGeco is actually performing quite well", "James Wicklund - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Paal, thank you. Impressive presentation. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jim.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, thanks. Good morning. So Paal, during the downturn one of the concerns is that if you lose pricing internationally, you never get it back. But clearly, you're quite confident recouping much of the pricing concessions. I guess once again \u2013 sorry asking a dumb question \u2013 but what makes the difference this time. Is it the repricing triggers you have in your contracts? Is it the competitive dynamics have clearly shifted here or is it the oil prices giving you the confidence to recoup those pricings?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "If you compare it to the previous downturn in 2009, at that stage, the industry came off a massive price increase period of four years, five years. And at that stage, pricing came down and it basically has not come back since then. So we are in a very different situation industrywide at this stage where the service industry hasn't had a price increase in the period in between now and 2009, so there isn't that much to give. Profitability for the more profitable companies have come through internal transformations and through significant investments in technology, like in our case. So we have not gained any pricing so we have very little pricing to give up.", "Now in a dramatic downturn as we have been experiencing over the past seven quarters, there is a need to align with the customer base, which obviously has immediate oil price exposure, and we have done that, and the vast majority of the pricing concessions we have made to existing and valid contracts are temporary in nature, they're either time bound or they are linked to some kind of oil price trigger. And that's why we have aligned with our customers on the down of the cycle and we now expect that, that would be returned to us as oil prices start to increase. So it is quite a different situation today than the previous downturn that we were facing in 2009 and 2010.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And I guess \u2013 perhaps you could just expand a little bit on the increased activity you were talking about in the Middle East, particularly in the GCC. You've been talking about Kuwait's getting a little better, you talked about some increases in Saudi. Is there any talk over there about perhaps expansion projects or maybe a renewed focus on improving recovery rates that have a greater technology component for you? Any shift along those lines?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think there is a constant discussion within all of these large producers in the core part of OPEC or in the GCC around how they maintain or even increase production, right. So it varies by country and we leave it up to the country to, I would say, formalize and state those plans. But I would say Saudi has an active program to maintain their maximum sustainable production level which is widely known, while there are also very active programs in both the UAE and Kuwait to increase production. This includes both drilling of wells, seismic activity, as well as fracking and even surface facilities. So we are very actively involved in all aspects of this, our technology is very central to all of these projects and we are extremely well placed to continue to take our share of the growth in activity in this part of the world.", "J. David Anderson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Thanks a lot. I wonder whether you could talk a bit about the opportunity for Schlumberger to drive better pricing and margins through integration and technology. Is this an opportunity that's best presented in North America or is it in certain international markets? Can you talk a little bit more specific about when and where exactly we should expect you to sign for this first?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as you know, Ole, we have a broad range of integration capabilities, which ranges all the way from project coordination to integrated drilling, integrated production and all the way up to SPM. And I think those four models are applicable in pretty much every country and basin around the world, depending on the state of the customer, the interest of the customer and what kind of resources they're developing, right. But we see a general, I would say, adaptation of all aspects of integration taking place all around the world.", "The least impact of integration so far, if I just look at the high level, has been in North America where it's still rather fragmented in between the rig and the various parts of the drilling process as well as in the production and completion part of the work. So we are continuing to drive forward our offering around creating a total drilling system and a total completion system, including fracking, for the land markets. And I'm quite optimistic that these should have significant uptake even in places like U.S. land or some of the other unconventional basins around the world, but the general adaptation of more integration we are seeing, and we continue to invest into that both from a hardware and software process control standpoint.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. And then when it comes to the when and where, you addressed the where but the when part, is there something we should start to see already now in the third quarter, some evidence that \u2013 some of the initiatives you're rolling out actually translates to higher margins if it does look at what you're doing internally and isolate away the broader cycle?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in terms of margins, I think \u2013 we are looking to get margins in the base business as well right, because that's where we have made the largest pricing concessions and that's where we also want to get back some of the temporary concessions we've made. But I think all the integration-related business offerings we have is executed well and well aligned with the customer, brings value in terms of higher profitability to us but also lower cost per barrel for our customers, right.", "So in terms of timing of it, Ole, it's difficult to say that you're going to see some kind of major impact in one particular quarter. I think the level of integration-related activity has held up well, I would say, during this downturn. It is down in percentage terms, which you would expect, but it has held up well as well as our new technology sales has held up well also during the cycle. So I think we're very well positioned. And as activity starts to increase and resources, both on the customer side as well as on the service industry side, becomes shorter, then I think the multi-skilling and presenting one package with simpler interfaces is going to be quite appealing to the customer base.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Makes sense. My follow-up with you, Scott. If you could give us a little bit more detail on the Greater Enfield, where it seems to be quite a few firsts there in terms of integration of reservoir management and flow assurance to the hardware side. And if you could talk just a little bit through what exactly is it that's new in terms of what you achieved with this contract.", "Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited", "Yeah, good.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "What does it entail?", "Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited", "Yeah, absolutely, Ole. Look, this is a flagship win for the OneSubsea team and, as you know, we've been working with Woodside for a long time to first win their frame agreement then indeed to move this project forward. But as Paal just discussed, right, this is a big technology play and it allows us to preserve some pricing because we can uniquely differentiate ourselves from anybody else.", "But what we've done here is essentially provide relatively standard horizontal trees combined with the boosting system and then the real technology is with the Unified Controls System that will span both the boosting system and the subsea architecture as well as the completion with the landing string. And so now, we've got a Unified Controls System that controls all aspects that sit on the seafloor, and you could imagine the cost savings for the customer when you bring all of that together. So, again, we've worked real hard with Woodside. We're very excited to move this project forward with them and we think it's a great example of the true capabilities of OneSubsea.", "Ole H. Slorer - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ole.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Good afternoon, gentlemen.", "Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited", "Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "So maybe as a quick follow-up on the Cameron question for Scott. Very impressive margins in the quarter. Can you give us your thoughts about margins moving forward into the back half of the year and maybe even 2017, and also discuss what your order outlook is out there, what you're hearing and seeing as far as opportunities for OneSubsea.", "Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited", "Sure. It's a broad question but we can provide some general guidance here. Look. The 15.8% that we were able to achieve in the quarter was exceptional. And as you know, it's one of the highest quarters we've ever had. The forward look is a little bit complicated because what's happening is we've got really strong execution in both Drilling, OneSubsea and Process systems, and those are our bigger backlog and longer-cycle businesses, and those are going to start to come down. And now, you've got a lot of pricing pressure that we've seen in 2015 start to come into the mix.", "And so we think 15.8% is a very high level, that will start to taper down here in the quarters to come. And then where we really start to see some uplift and it's a matter of timing here, but as Paal described, right, we do believe we're going to get pricing in the shorter-cycle businesses, so both Surface and Valves & Measurement. And then in addition to that, you start to layer in the synergies from the integration itself. And so I don't expect us to exceed the 15.8% here in the short term. I think that comes down steadily over time. But then as we get pricing traction and those short-cycle businesses begin to pick up, we could indeed see those margins come back up into a higher territory.", "And in terms of booking outlook, I'll start with deepwater. And what I'll say is it is in a very bad state in terms of progressing and moving projects forward. And we're very fortunate to work with Woodside and get one past FID, but we don't see any major projects here for the remainder of the year. In fact, our estimates for trees this year are less than 100. There are a few projects out there next year that are relatively large in size. We feel good about our ability to work with operators and achieve those, but at the same time, the industry has got significant capacity, and those are going to be incredibly competitive.", "And so I'm a little concerned about the outlook with deepwater. Now, however, the counter to that is we have a very strong belief in what we're doing with OneSubsea. And like I described in the opening comments, right, the ability to tie the reservoir to what we're doing, drive cost out of the system through our standardized approach and then get more out of production, we feel very good about that.", "On the other businesses, Surface and V&M are tied to rig count and they have a significant North American exposure and, as Paal described, we think those markets start to increase here going forward. And so that's going to be the big kind of flux position for us, if you will, if those start to come back faster, then our outlook starts to look pretty good.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Okay. Very, very helpful Scott. And then one more for Paal is, when we think of Schlumberger in the past and we think about revenue growth, we used to think through it on a GeoMarket basis and you guys have done a very good job in recent presentations giving the incremental margin opportunities across your product lines. So when you think about now your product segments and the rank order of revenue growth coming out of the trough, is it fair to think that Production and Drilling has the largest revenue opportunities out of the bottom followed by Cameron and Characterization? And any thoughts on magnitude of difference would be helpful.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So I think that's a reasonable assumption, Angie. We believe that the activity increase that we are going to see in the coming quarters is going to be very closely associated with production. And that's either linked to that drilling or the completion part of production. So our Drilling Group and our Production Group, I think, are the ones that will see the quickest impact of higher E&P investments.", "Now with that said, at some stage, the industry will need to start exploring again, and the level of exploration-related activity is at an unprecedented low. So obviously a huge growth runway for our Characterization Group going forward when that starts to kick in, but I think you're right in assuming that that will be after the initial uptick in well-related development type of activity. And I think Scott has described very well the impact on Cameron, the long-cycle businesses, I think, will follow after the short cycle ones. So I think that's a good set of assumptions.", "Angie M. Sedita - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Fair enough. Thanks. I'll turn it over.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon where you are.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So Paal, I wanted to follow up here on comments on incremental margin goal of 65%. And I was hoping that you could provide a little additional color around that target vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. market and the international market, and then I have additional follow-up after that.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. So first of all, I didn't say 65% I said north of 65%.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "I got it.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not ready to sort of break it down for you in any more geographical granularity other than it is a high level goal, it's an ambitious goal, but there is a logic behind it. I think first of all, our decrementals for 2015 and so far in 2016 is in the range of 30% to 32%. And if you can double the incremental from that decremental rate, that means that you should be able to restore 2014 earnings, which is the place we want to be as quickly as possible to continue to deliver on the plan we laid out in the 2014 investor conference, we can actually recover 2014 earnings by only a 50% recovery in the revenue drops that we've seen since 2014.", "Now there is a lot of work behind the number in terms of how achievable it is. But as an example, in 2014 in the international market, on a pretty low revenue growth rate of 3%, 4%, we actually delivered 69% incrementals without any price in the international markets. So we have a precedence for doing it, it's obviously going to be challenging to do that also in North America, in particular North America land, but with the impact, we will have to have from price on this, we are for sure going to try to deliver incrementals north of 65%, yes.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then the follow up on that is regards to timing. So is the target of north of 65% incrementals by the end of 2016, is it for full year 2017? Can you just give us some general, might be hard to give the specifics, but some general views on when you're pushing to get that done?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think I would look at it in the following way. I would say that activity growth associated with some pricing recovery should \u2013 we are aiming to deliver north of 65% on that. So I think as we now navigate the bottom and we aren't expecting a uniform V shaped recovery here. Like I said, it's going to be in slow and steady recovery. Some of countries that we operate in will stay flat longer. Some of them might go down a little bit further. But overall, we believe we are at bottom and when we see consistent growth in any geography, this is the incremental that we are looking for. And as the entire company gets back into a more solid growth mode, that's when we should approach the companywide 65%. But we are targeting 65% incrementals on the growth that we are seeing going forward.", "Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's great color. Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Thanks. Paal, if we could just talk a little bit about the near term, if you will. You waxed optimistic here with regard to the industry bottoming and focusing more on market share strengthening versus, I guess, protecting decrementals and pricing recapture and high-grading of contracts. And yet, we just had a significant pre-tax charge, your rightsizing continues to be pretty assertive, and we've laid off 16,000 people in the first half. So I'm trying to reconcile those two, the challenges you see in the near term. And specifically, can we talk about Q3 in terms of what the sequential headwinds and tailwinds are and whether you think earnings per share, flat, up or down quarter-on-quarter?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. So in terms of the charge that we've taken, this is basically catching up and finalizing the resizing of the company, which has now been dropping in activity levels over the past seven quarters. So this charge is linked to a number of things that we have been executing in the second quarter. And should bring the company into the shape where we are well positioned to navigate the bottom of the market and also well positioned to start growing again going forward. So we put a lot of details and scrutiny into any kind of impairment charge that we take and we have done so as well in the charge for Q2, which is sizable, but we believe this is prudent, this is right and it's justified to do what we've done and that's why we did it.", "Now in terms of the outlook, like I said, we are at the bottom but we are not expecting an immediate and sharp recovery. If you look at North America versus international and some of the moving parts going into Q3, North America still has significant overcapacity at this stage in terms of services. And the low barrier to entry is also going to continue to be a major headwind, right. So we expect modest increase in land activity but this is going to be partially offset by lower offshore work. We are significantly down in Alaska, in Eastern Canada, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico.", "We expect some improvement in pricing but it's going to be way short of the level required to breakeven into Q3. So we don't expect any major positive earnings improvement from North America in Q3 but it shouldn't get much worse either, right. So fairly, fairly stable earnings for North America in the third quarter. And fairly similar international markets, there's less overcapacity there due to the higher barrier entry and it's also quite a narrowing competitive landscape. So in principle, it should be easier to recover some of the temporary pricing concessions that we have made which, in most cases, in international market is also time bound or linked to the oil price. But given the limited increase in activity we see for Q3, again, we don't expect any significant positive sequential earnings contribution from international. So overall, we expect flattish EPS in Q3.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, I'm just curious with regard to the discussion that you're having with resource holders and especially domestic resource holders, just given the evisceration and impairment of the oil service value chain on the one hand, and the desire on the part of resource holders to preserve the efficiencies that they've won and earned over the course of this downturn, is there a recognition on their part that there are probably less than a handful of companies who possess both the operational and financial flexibility to in fact preserve those efficiencies for them?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if you talk about efficiencies, are you talking about their current cost per barrel? Because that is to a large extent driven by very low service pricing, right. So I think there's no company in North America that is able to continue for a long period of time to operate at these pricing levels. But if you talk about the technical performance of how efficient we drill and how efficient we frac...", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "Yeah.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "...I agree with you. There's a handful of companies that can do that and I think that number is shrinking. And unless there is some pricing recovery and some ways to create more financially viable contracts for even these limited number of companies, that number is going to shrink further, yes.", "William A. Herbert - Simmons & Company International", "All right. Thank you, sir.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Simon Farrant - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay. So we see that there are a number of questions still remaining and we're going to extend the call another 5 minutes to 10 minutes. So operator, please can you give us the next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "James C. West - Evercore ISI", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "James C. West - Evercore ISI", "Paal, clearly the strategy of the company has changed. You're switching to offense from playing defense with decrementals. This was obviously not a new strategy or you wouldn't be telling us about it today, it's not happening today. So I'm curious with this shift, when did you start, what's guidance you've given to your management team, and what has the customer response been so far to this trend of we're going to regain pricing and we will not work at these kind of pricing levels going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So we've started this dialogue and this engagement, first of all, internally with our senior management team during the second quarter. This is not a \u2013 it's not a surprising playbook. At some stage when you do approach bottom, this is the shift that you need to make.", "James C. West - Evercore ISI", "Right.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "But we have, I would say, done this in a concerted fashion during the second quarter. We have had very good discussions with the senior management team and laid our plans for how are we going to now shift the focus and how we navigate the next phase.", "And as I said earlier on, the understanding of the viability and state of the industry value chain in each of the 80 countries we operate in is extremely important to make sure that you are optimally positioned to capture the market in the countries which we believe are going to see a sustainable increase in activity, where we can also generate sustainable earnings going forward, right. So we spend a lot of time internally with the team to lay out these plans and put this methodology in place, so we are in good shape there. We're already in execution mode of it. And in terms of the engagement with the customers, it's started. It's still at a fairly, I would say, low frequency but that is now what we will do much more widespread as we enter the third quarter here.", "But obviously, a lot of these discussions are going to be challenging. There's not a lot of surplus in any situation but we believe that the temporary concessions we have made, at least part of that will need to be returned to us. But in return for that, we are very open to engage in different types of collaborations where we through a better management of the interface and better commercial alignment and together drive unnecessary costs out of the system, so that we can make a more or the industry value chain viable in many countries around the world. So that's certainly the objective.", "James C. West - Evercore ISI", "And that would mean increasing your scope or adding performance-based metrics to the contracts?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely. Both of those are aspects that we believe will generate total value that then can be shared between the supplier and the E&P companies, and also back to what we talked about earlier in the call, all around the integration offering that we have and that we continue to invest into.", "James C. West - Evercore ISI", "Right. Okay. And then a follow-up from me on the market share. You commented in your press release about market share gains or tender wins in recent quarters. How much of this is due to, perhaps, technology or how much of this is due to just the fact that there's really only you and one other \u2013 globally now \u2013 that participate in the market and you've seen a lot of your competitors just drop out?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think the narrowing competitive environment has some impact on this. And also I think if you look at margin performance over the past 18 months in the international market in between several of the large players, some of these players are already in the red, in which case their room to take on contracts which they might feel is challenging is very, very limited. So the position we have in terms of strength, both in footprint, scale, local knowledge as well as the overall contract portfolio we have, allows us to be quite competitive in these tenders. And I think very importantly as well is to look at the difference between the contract portfolio and maybe the immediate revenue translation of these contracts.", "In the international market, it's very important to have the contracts, and we have a range of contracts today that we have won with very little activity in them, but they have potential for significant increases in activity in terms of rig additions and so forth going forward. So what is very important over the past year, which we have had a lot of focus on, has been the tender win rate and then having the contracts and then being able to translate that into revenue in the coming one to two years.", "James C. West - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks. Paal, if I could follow up on your comment that the industry needs to improve efficiencies through I think you said innovative hardware and high-level software control systems. In the press release, there's an anecdote noting a pretty big drop in pump and blender NPT and R&M expense through the use of RCM technology and predictive analytics. I was wondering how scalable these types of applications are and whether or not the deployment depends on the introduction of the next generation frac spread or can it be rolled out on the legacy fleet?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So for that particular application, it is being rolled out on the legacy fleet. These are measurements that we are currently recording and we have been for quite a while. And this is one example of what we can do by being able to first organize our data in a way where it's accessible and then building the right analytic applications on top of it and then providing that to our fleet operations.", "So over the past 18 months or so, we have undertaken a massive reorganization of the entire database we have and the data we record on a daily basis from our operations into a cutting-edge data lake, which is then accessible for these type of applications. And we've also established a new applications group which then has the ability to build these analytics and tap into the data lake and provide this type of information for our operations.", "So the example you refer to in pressure pumping is one, we have a multitude of similar type of applications being built and which are going to be deployed in the near future with a similar type of impact on the operation, and this is all part of the transformation program that we've been talking about for several years.", "Robert Scott Rowe - President - Cameron Group, Schlumberger Limited", "If I could just add, this is a big part of the Cameron integration as well, right. So in Cameron, we really didn't progress the ability to collect data on our equipment and what we're doing is tapping in to the expertise here at Schlumberger. And in fact, more than half of our 30 integrated technology programs are around the theme of controls and predictive maintenance and reliability.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "And just so I understand the quantitative impact, this $30 million reference of three-year cost savings, that was just with respect to that one test fleet?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And if I could ask a follow-up quickly for Simon, in terms of the working capital management during the downturn, it's obviously been remarkable here. So, first of all, kudos. But my question really is how the transformation initiatives will work in recovery when working capital actually becomes a use of cash?", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Michael, as you mentioned, we performed well in second quarter despite some exceptional payments. And the transformation program is helping us quite a bit, it's on the CapEx side on some of the cost elements, collection of receivables. I mean the transformation program is across the board on most of our activity and processes. So it is going to \u2013 we're looking forward to not to consume as much cash in the upturn because first, we do have excess equipment, and we don't think the CapEx is going to turn around in a major way. And, yes, the transformation program will continue to contribute as it contributed in the downturn.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, Michael, just one clarification. So you asked me about the savings. So the savings we quoted was for all the test fleets we had in South Texas. It was not just one fleet.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Not just one. Okay. Very good. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sorry, did I get the concern you have or the answer that you're looking for?", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yes, you did, Simon. I was really sort of thinking about inventory and I guess the excess equipment has a big impact on that, so thank you.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Inventory is a big part of it as well, yes. That's what I meant by managing the material and supplies as well.", "Michael LaMotte - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Yeah. Excellent. Thank you, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Dan Boyd with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hey. Thanks for squeezing me on. So, Paal, you've been very clear that international is going to be the driver of earnings getting back to the 2015 or 2014 level, but some of your comments on North America have been a little bit more mixed, so just trying to understand what you're saying there about how the transformation program will pay dividends in the future. But are you also implying there that you can get back to peak margins in North America on a significantly lower rig count than what we saw previously?", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, so just to clarify, so I'm saying that obviously our international business and the state of that and the state of the international industry value chain is in much better shape than what the North American value chain is, in which case the basis for sustainable earnings growth at this stage is much higher and better internationally.", "Now in North America, I think you've got to separate the industry view from just how Schlumberger navigates in the system, and I think the industry, I think there are some questions and challenges to be asked, right. How is the industry in the next upcoming cycle going to be able to operate where the entire value chain ends up being cash flow and profit-positive as we enter into a complete new cycle? That was not the case in the previous cycle, and I don't think we can go on for many cycles in a similar type of fashion.", "Now there is a part of North America land which is viable, even at lower prices, but how big that is and how much you can step up from the core acreage, I think, is to be seen. Now how we operate in that, we are aiming to be very competitive on efficiency and, in addition to that, continue to bring new technology into play which can help our customers and drive up production per well. And we have a very good offering already in place for that.", "So we will continue to operate the way we have been with a focus in both these dimensions. But I think at this stage, if you look at the state of the industry value chain, I can't tell you that we are going to get back to previous peak margins in North America or North America land because at this stage, I just don't see how that can be funded in the entire value chain.", "Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. Thanks, and then one last one for Simon. Lots of free cash flow generation, but buybacks pretty much slowed to a trickle this quarter. So what happened there and what's the plan going forward?", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good question. So, look. We always said that we'll be opportunistic on our buyback, and we use excess cash or remaining cash, normally, after the business needs, to return it through buybacks. The $11.6 billion that we have in cash obviously do reflect excess cash. But excess cash should not be looked at on a one given period, we have to project several quarters in advance.", "And during the quarter, there were major cash movements in relation to the Cameron acquisition. The cash we paid to the shareholders, we bought back some of the debt of Cameron. So we took a decision to slow down the buyback, sit back, reassess our need of cash, given all the opportunities we have in front of us, and we will go back into the market. We're always in the market. Our policy will continue to be in the market, but it is not going to be evenly spread going forward.", "Daniel J. Boyd - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Simon Ayat - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And it is an exceptional period during the quarter due to the acquisition and basically a reassessment of how we're going to use the cash, but buyback will always be a part of our plan.", "Paal Kibsgaard - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thank you. So before we close this morning, I would like to summarize the four most important points that we discussed. First, we believe that we've reached the bottom of the cycle and that E&P investments now have to increase in order for the industry to meet the growing supply deficit. As E&P investment starts growing, a large part will initially have to be consumed on supplier industry price increases in order for capacity and capabilities to be available and for operating standards to be met.", "Second, most basins around the world are today at unprecedented low levels of activity and we expect to see a broad-based increase in investments going forward funded by higher oil prices. The magnitude and sustainability of the investment increase will, however, be a function of the financial viability of the entire oil industry value chain in each basin and country which will vary significantly.", "Third, our deep local knowledge, the breadth and depth of our technology offering together with our geographical scale will clearly set us apart and further enable us to deliver differentiated financial results going forward.", "And fourth, the shortfall in profits and cash flow throughout the entire industry value chain can only be permanently addressed by a dramatic step change in industry performance, including intrinsic quality and efficiency, technology system innovations, and more aligned and collaborative business models, and Schlumberger is and will remain at the absolute forefront of this industry transformation.", "That concludes today's call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2016 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York following the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting.", "Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group. Scott will join the earnings call through the fourth quarter of this year to provide an update on the Cameron Group business, integration and synergies.", "Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Scott will provide the Cameron update, and Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.", "Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our third quarter press release, which is posted on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "I'll now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.", "Third quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.53 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $237 million of pretax merger and integration charges, associated with the acquisition of Cameron. This consisted of $149 million non-cash inventory purchase accounting item that will not recur. The balance relates to transaction costs as well as a dedicated integration team and other costs to achieve synergies.", "We will continue to incur merger and integration charges for the rest of 2016 and into 2017. Our third quarter revenue of $7 billion decreased 2% sequentially. This decrease was entirely driven by reduced activity in the Cameron Group due to its declining backlog. Excluding the impact of Cameron Group, third quarter revenue actually increased 1% sequentially.", "Pretax operating margins increased 119 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Margins increased sequentially in each group except for Cameron. These increases reflect the benefits from cost reduction initiatives as well as the effects of last quarter's itemized asset write-downs, which contributed to approximately 50% of the reduction in depreciation.", "Operational highlights by product group were as follows; third quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margin increased 292 basis points to 19.1%. The revenue growth was primarily driven by increased testing services and WesternGeco activities.", "Margins improved sequentially across all reservoir characterization technologies, but most noticeably in wireline and testing services. Drilling group revenue of $2 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margins increased by 241 basis points.", "The margin expansion was largely due to the benefit of cost initiatives and reduced losses in Venezuela due to further alignment of our resources in the market to match the reduced level of activity.", "Production group revenue of $2.1 billion was also essentially flat sequentially while margin improved 41 basis points, largely due to strong SPM activity. Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12% sequentially. Despite the 12% reduction in revenue, pretax operating margin only declined 34 basis points to 16%.", "The revenue decline was driven by the decrease in backlog that has significantly impacted the drilling group line. However, strong project execution and OneSubsea combined was cost control initiatives across the Group limited the margin decline.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 16% in the third quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Gounf forward, our tax rate will be driven by the overall geographic mix of earnings.", "During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations. During the first three quarters of 2016, we have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $117 million during the third quarter and paying $800 million of severance and one one-off Cameron related transaction payments during the first nine months of the year.", "Our net debt increased $122 million during the quarter to $10.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $11.1 billion. During the quarter we spend $156 million to repurchase two million shares at an average price of $77. On a year-to-date basis, we had spend $662 million to repurchase 9.5 million shares at an average price of $69.64 per share.", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included approximately $400 million on CapEx, $140 million on SPM investments, $160 million of multi-client and $700 million of dividend payments.", "Our CapEx on a year-to-date basis was $1.4 billion, which includes two quarter of Cameron. CapEx for the full year of 2016 is now expected to be approximately $2 billion. These amounts do not include SPM or multi-client.", "And now I'll turn the conference call over to Scott.", "Robert Scott Rowe", "Hello everyone. I am pleased to provide an update on the progress of the Cameron Group, now they were six months into the combination with Schlumberger. Cameron continued to have good operating results in the third quarter, despite the challenges in the global marketplace and the contraction of our backlog driven by this prolonged downturn.", "In Q3, our revenue reduced by 12% sequentially to $1.3 billion. Despite this drop, we were able to successfully hold operating margins at 16% which is 19% decremental of a nearly all time high margin performance in the second quarter of this year.", "The higher margins are a result of relentless cost reductions combined with excellent project execution in our longer cycle businesses. We've now experienced seven straight quarters of reduced activity and pricing pressure in the marketplace and Cameron shorter cycle service and balance of measurement businesses have experienced a full effect of reduced activity, spending cuts and pricing pressure, but are now positioned to rebound with any incremental activity.", "Despite the duration of the downturn, these two businesses continue to be profitable and have strong cash flow as we've managed our cost structure and working capital well throughout the cycle. Typical lead times in these businesses range from three weeks to nine months and we expect to see revenue flattening future quarters and begin to grow again in mid 2017 as onshore activity picks up around the world.", "In our longer cycle businesses, OneSubsea Drilling Systems, we've been extremely successful in expanding margins throughout the cycle. OneSubsea and drilling remain accretive to the overall margins of the Cameron Group. In fact OneSubsea had record profitability at 23.5% this quarter. The profitability improvements and the market share gains over the last two years validate the vision we had when we created OneSubsea.", "The drilling at OneSubsea teams have done an excellent job improving our project delivery processes, driving cost out of projects and products and capitalizing on our installed base by expanding our service and aftermarket offering. Going forward these improvements will be partly offset by extremely competitive pricing and lower volumes.", "These two businesses are now entering a period of revenue decline as our backlog has fallen for seven straight quarters. We are now entering the base of the downturn that the other Schlumberger businesses have experienced over the past 18 months.", "On a brighter note, our book-to-bill ratio for these two businesses was 0.8 in the third quarter, which was highest ratio we have seen since the downturn began. This gives us visibility to revenue growth in 2018. The drilling systems business will contract the most as new equipment orders for floating and jack-up rates are nearly non-existent and our focus has now shifted to land rigs and capitalizing on our market-leading installed base of pressure control equipment.", "Before I transition to the integration, I want to spend a minute on how we're positioning OneSubsea. We now have eight paid studies and we're working on 30 customer engagements on our OneSubsea and Subsea 7 alliance. I fully expect to win a small award that utilizes OneSubsea's equipment and Subsea 7 installation capability before the year is over.", "We see the market as an area of growth in the deepwater sector. Operators are looking to spend significantly less and drive higher returns by capitalizing on existing host facilities. OneSubsea is uniquely positioned with our standardized Subsea Tree, our single well boosting system, our unified control system and our partnership with Subsea 7 to capitalize on this growth opportunity.", "We also have the capability to integrate this further with the deepwater drilling and production teams at Schlumberger to provide further turnkey solutions to operators who are looking to tie back these assets.", "The success of the integration of Cameron into Schlumberger continues to exceed our expectations. I would like to confirm that the transaction is again accretive in the third quarter as well as confirm that we will achieve the $300 million synergy target in the first year of the combination.", "In the third quarter we booked $139 million of synergy-related work, which landed in every business segment in the Cameron Group. One notable award in the quarter was an integrated project for Chevron in Thailand that consisted of surface wellheads and trees, wireline logging services, M-I SWACO drilling fluids and services as well as the supply of barite.", "This is a great example of subsurface and service integration across three different Schlumberger groups. While there is still more cost savings to be had, our integration will shift focus to driving revenue synergies and capitalizing on the vast geographic network of Schlumberger.", "We see significant growth opportunities for Cameron in the Middle East, Russia, Latin America and India where Cameron can leverage the substantial presence and relationships that Schlumberger has in these geographies.", "In summary, I could not be more pleased with how our group is performing in the down cycle and how we're capitalizing on the opportunities that the combination of Schlumberger and Cameron has created. I'll now turn it over to Bob.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. After seven quarters of unprecedented activity decline, the business environment stabilized as expected in the third quarter, confirming that we have indeed reached the bottom of the cycle.", "Our third-quarter revenue still decreased 2% sequentially, but this was largely driven by the anticipated reduction in activity at Cameron, as the product backlog continued to decline. Excluding Cameron, revenue increased 1% sequentially, driven by higher activity in North America land, Middle East, Russia and Australia.", "Since the start of this downturn and added deepening to uncharted territory, our entire management team has worked relentlessly to protect the financial strength of the company. This includes carefully navigating the commercial landscape by balancing pricing concessions and market share and also by proactively removing a staggering $6 billion of quarterly costs through headcount reductions internal efficiency improvements and strong supply chain management.", "This has enabled us to deliver unmatched financial results by maintaining pretax operating margins well above 10% and delivering sufficient free cash flow to cover a range of strategic CapEx investments as well as our ongoing dividend commitments.", "We continue to carry forward a strong financial focus as seen in our third quarter results where we delivered 19% decremental margins in the Cameron Group and incremental margins north of 65% for the other three groups combined, excluding any tailwind from previous impairment charges.", "These results which represents a small step on our path towards first restoring and subsequently exceeding our pre-downturn earnings per share and financial returns are mostly driven by internal cost and efficiency improvements, with so far only a minor impact from price increases and high grading of our contract portfolio.", "Going forward is critical for us to recover the large pricing concessions we have made over the past two years to allow us to restore investment levels in technology innovation, system integration and operational quality and efficiency, which are all key enablers of our customer's project performance.", "As indicated in July, we have during this quarter started pricing recovery discussions with a large part of our global customer base, while there is a general understanding from our customers that pricing will have to increase, there were no material movements during the quarter, but with the recent increase in oil prices, the basis for these discussions has now strengthened.", "Looking forward to the activity recovery phase, we will only allocate investments, operating capacity and expertise to contracts and basins that meet our financial return expectations, in the same way our customers allocate capital to projects in their portfolios.", "Currently a noticeable part of our contracts do not meet these financial return criteria and this is our starting point for reestablishing sustainable customer relationships that will warrant allocation of our capital capacity and expertise.", "In addition to our focus on pricing recovery, we will in the coming quarters also aim to restore proper payment schedules from our customers in line with the terms and conditions in our contracts to address the payment delays we today are seeing from many customers around the world.", "Still in spite of these payment delays, free cash flow generation in the third quarter remained solid at $700 million as inventory and CapEx investments was again tightly managed. Next I'll review the third quarter trends from our geographical operations and I will focus my comments on the Characterization Drilling $ Production Groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group.", "In North America, revenue for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups increased 3% sequentially as solid growth on land was largely offset by a further revenue reduction in the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Eastern Canada impacting all product groups. The strong growth on land was driven by the U.S. with acute rig count increased significantly and with more than half of the rigs being added in the Permian Basin.", "The increased drilling activity is reflected in our drilling and measurements pipeline, which posted 31% revenue growth in U.S. land compared to the second quarter. At this stage we're seeing a growing trend in U.S. land to what's even longer horizontal laterals or super laterals aiming at further increasing reservoir contacts.", "One example of this is a well we drilled for Eclipse Resources with a because purchase resources with a record lateral length of 18,500 feet using our industry-leading PowerDrive vorteX rotary steerable system. This emerging trend has already created a significant increase in the uptake of our high-end drilling technologies and has also provided our drilling group with a clear path towards profitability on land.", "We've therefore shifted focus from maintaining presence to now gaining market share for our drilling business in North America land.", "In the hydraulic fracturing market, the stage count increased by 17% sequentially, driven by higher activity and also by customers now actively depleting their duct well inventory. Still the fracturing market continues to be completely commoditized and significantly oversupplied with a large number of very hungry players.", "In addition, the significant increase in sand volume pumper stage is already starting to create inflation on both product and distribution costs, which will further obstruct and delay the hydraulic fracturing industry's path towards restoring profitability.", "Today the North America fracturing business continues to be highly dilutive to our financial performance and this combined with a short term market outlook means that we have not yet shifted focus towards gaining market share. Instead we continue to maintain our market presence while further concentrating activity around our core operating areas.", "Still we continue to monitor the fracturing market closely and we're ready to deploy our significant stacked capacity on short notice, but only when the market environment can support positive contributions.", "While this trend is very encouraging, I would like to stress that these new contract models are only an addition to our offering and that we will continue to actively pursue traditional models for customers who prefers this type of engagement. As we now look to further capitalize on these emerging trends in the international market, we have two major advantages.", "First, our unmatched scale in terms of people, equipment and infrastructure, which allow us to quickly adjust to the increasing technical complexity and additional demand from our customers, while ensuring safe and consistent quality in our operations and second by having been present in all parts of the world for the past 80 to 90 years, we have established deep industry relationships and unprecedented local credibility, which makes us an natural partner to explore new contract models and translate these into successful business relationships.", "With that, let's take a closer look at the trends we're seeing in the three international operating areas. In Latin America, the combined revenue for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups declined by 5% sequentially due to continued reductions in EMP spend and activity throughout the regions.", "However the two year activity slide was clearly slowing during the quarter and we believe we have now reached the bottom of the cycle also in Latin America. The sequential revenue drop came entirely from the drilling and production groups while the Characterization group posted a 2% increase, driven by solid multi-client seismic sales in Mexico.", "Here WesternGeco our 80,000 square kilometers of marine surveys in the prime deep water acreage that will be included in the upcoming bid rounds was the first taking place December 5 of this year. In Mexico, our drilling activity is also expected to pick up in early parts of 2017, driven by both PAMAX and the successful players from the shallow water big grounds that has already taken place.", "In Ecuador, activity remained solid driven by our SPM projects and we continue to progress in line with our fee development plans, both with respect to work scope and production levels.", "As for in the regions, activity remained subdued due to severe budget constraints for most customers, however we are seeing early signs of recovery in several countries. In Argentina there is clear optimism amongst the industry players that the new government will take the required steps to further encourage E&P investment in the country as they seek to reduce the oil import dependency, which should have a positive impact on E&P investments in 2017.", "In Brazil, Petrobras continues to focus on arresting the decline in the mature Campos Basin and is considering opening up for a new and more commercially aligned business models with the service industry which could include feet per barrel contract.", "In Venezuela our operations remained largely shut down on site work we do for the IOC JVs in the Faja. However, we are in discussions with PDVSA on a new contract model, which will include a payment assurance mechanism and we are optimistic that this contract will be finalized in the coming months and that operations could start in Q1.", "And in Columbia, with oil prices around $50, activity is expected to increase in the coming quarters at Ecopetrol and several other players are preparing for offshore drilling campaigns in 2017.", "Revenue in Europe, CIS, and Africa declined 3% sequentially excluding the Cameron Group while strong sequential growth in Russia and flat activity in the North Sea and North Africa was more than offset by a further reduction in activity throughout sub-Sahara Africa.", "The drop in revenue was driven by the drilling and production groups, while the characterization group posted solid sequential growth. A large part of the growth in the characterization group came from Russia as summer season activity peaked both on land and offshore and with revenue growth further supported by a stronger Ruble.", "Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal seasonal slowdown in Russia due to winter weather while the outlook for 2017 activity continues to be strong. The North Sea posted sharp sequential revenue following a solid summer season where activity in Norway was particularly strong.", "Looking forward to Q4, we expect to see the normal decline in activity as summer projects conclude and winter weather sets in. Still expiration success in Norway and several large project startups indicate stronger 2017 activity in the North Sea.", "Revenue in continental Europe was up 19% sequentially on strong integrated project performance and deep water exploration activity in Bulgaria. Higher oil prices will lead to increased production-related activity in this region with a 5% rig count increase expected in Q4, further supported by the restart of offshore activity in the East and Med in the early parts of 2017.", "North Africa activity remained stable with strong revenue sequentially, while we expect moderate growth in activity in Q4 partly supported by increased market share from recent tender wins for tracks. The market challenges in sub-Sahara and Africa continued in Q3 with yet another significant drop in activity and with the rig count now down by 75% compared to Q4 2014.", "However with this latest drop, we do believe we have reached the bottom of the cycle also in this region and expect modest activity increases in most countries in Q4 with the exception of Angola.", "In the Middle East and Asia, Characterization, Drilling and Production Group revenue grew 2% sequentially as strength in the Middle East and Australia was partly offset by continued weakness in Asia. Both the Characterization and Drilling groups posted grow in the third quarter, while production group revenue was slightly down due to a temporary reduction in fracturing activity in the Middle East.", "In the GCC, the underlying, drilling and rig-less activity remained strong with solid revenues reported in all countries. In addition to this, we continue to progress on our early production facility project in Kuwait which represents another exciting growth opportunity for us.", "In Australia, our revenue increased in the third quarter after seven quarters of decline driven by additional land activity for the drilling group as well as higher offshore exploration activity for the Characterization Group.", "While in China, Indonesia and the rest of Southeast Asia, the revenue decline continued in the third quarter and at present, there are no signs of any imminent activity recovery in this region.", "Turning now to the oil macro, the supply and demand of crude is now more or less in balance as seen by the flattening global petroleum inventories and the start of consistent growth towards the end of the quarter in particular in North America. In addition, oil demand was again revised upwards in September and is now forecasted to be around 1.2 million barrels per day for both 2016 and 2017.", "At the same time global supply is plateauing as non-OPEC production continues to experience significant declines and even offsetting record production levels from OPEC in September. Based on current investment levels, we believe that 2017 non-OPEC production will at best be flat and any production outside from the U.S., Canada and Brazil will be offset by further declines in the rest of the global production base.", "Given the projected demand growth, this means that the call on OPEC will increase from the current record production levels, suggesting that the production outside from Nigeria, Libya and Iran may be needed to keep the markets in balance.", "All of this means that the period of oversupply and inventory build is over and that market segments should soon change, paving the way for an increase in oil prices and subsequently E&P investments. There is also a case to be made for a more rapid role on the global oil inventories and a more bullish outlook for the oil price in the event of a lower production upside from Libya, Nigeria and Iran OPEC and Russia implementation of production cuts for a steeper decline in non-OPEC production.", "In terms of the 2017 E&P investments, details are still limited. However we maintain that a V-shaped recovery is unlikely given the fragile financial state of the industry. Still we do see upsides in 2017 in North America land, the Middle East and Russia and we are making sure, we are optimally placed to capture a large share of this upside and importantly turn this additional activity into positive earnings contributions.", "With the unparalleled cost and cash discipline we have established, we are confident in our ability to deliver incremental margins North of 65% and a free cash flow conversion rate above 75%, which going forward will give a significant flexibility to both reinvest in our business as well as thoroughly return cash to our shareholders.", "Thank you very much. We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ", "James West", "Hey, good morning, Paal. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, James.", "James West", "Paal, you talked a lot in recent quarters about the need for increased industry collaboration and it looked to me going through the press release that you cited a number of examples, of course ISM projects, but also projects that looked to me that signal more collaboration, is that catching on, on a global basis.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I think we are seeing a growing interest in this. It varies a little bit amongst the different customer groups. But I would say overall, there is a growing trend of a desire to collaborate closer and also to implement more commercially aligned business models, which I alluded to in my prepared remarks. This goes all the way from the basic models linked to either time of production for a well, all the way up to fulfill management around the SPM concept. ", "James West", "Got you. And then one market where we haven't seen a lot of collaboration historically has been the U.S. land market, but you highlighted I think three or four different, different wins there. Could you talk, I know you talked a little bit about the evolving, super laterals in North America, but could you talk about the collaboration in North America, what you're seeing there and what the next steps are if that collaboration could lead to more technology improvements, technology advancements and use in North America.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes we cited a few of these examples in the press release. So we are seeing -- we are seeing signs of that taking place in North America land as well, but I would say on a percentage basis is obviously a lot lower returns than what we have internationally, but it\u2019s still encouraging to see stronger collaboration, both on the drilling side linked to drilling more complex wells at the super laterals.", "As well as on the production and completion side around how we optimize completions using information evaluation and a bit more sophisticated approach to fracing. So we are seeing it happening, but still in fairness it's a fairly small part of the business volume, but these technology opportunities both in the drilling side and on the completion side is really why we are in this market.", "We're not in it for the commodity side of it. We believe that ultimately technology will play an even larger role in the North America land markets and we continue to promote these capabilities and this part of our offering because we ultimately believe it's going to bring a lot more value for our customers.", "James West", "Yes. Thanks Paal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Angie Sedita", "So Paal as a follow-up to James' question, so the SPM certainly are growing market and important Schlumberger overall. So could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the investment opportunities and the pipeline of opportunities over the next one to two years? I assume that's growing and are you seeing an increasing number of IOCs that want to partner up with Schlumberger on some of these projects?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, for SPM we are seeing I would say a significantly growing interest across all customer groups. So far in terms of the discussions that are most advanced I would say are generally with the -- with the NOCs and the independence and even start-up companies, but we have -- we've had -- we have had discussions with IOCs on this contract model as well.", "But in terms of the opportunity set it is, it is growing and it's very significant. And as I quoted in my prepared remarks, we are today engaged in various stages of discussions in 20 countries around the world covering all the four operating areas.", "So while this used to be -- this model used to be contained to a handful of countries, we today see a rapid expansion of the interest and we have obviously staffed up significantly in our SPM product line to make sure that we can pursue all these opportunities, turn them into projects and subsequently execute the projects in line with our plans, but it's a significant growth opportunity and something that we are actively pursuing in all four operating areas.", "Angie Sedita", "All right, all right, fair enough. And then on the international side, you talked about the price concessions and some of them are oil-based triggers and some time based and so does it happen as you hear a certain oil price or there is time bound concession that initially it moves into play or you have a conversation first with these NOCs and how much of this do you think will actually be returned to demand?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, the whole discussion around pricing, first of all is going to take a little bit of time. We indicated in July that we are firmly putting this on the agenda and we have done so in the third quarter. We've had engagement and discussions with most customers around the world.", "I think there is -- there is a general acceptance from the customer base that ultimately prices are going to have to come up. Not a lot of movement as we expected in the third quarter, but I would say, given the increase we've seen in oil prices over the past month or so and the potential trajectory, we could see going forward, I think there is much stronger basis for having these discussions at this stage.", "And then we will discussions individually with our customers depending on the contract, the model and the contract situation we have with them. It could be at some states that some of these contracts will be -- will be rebid and if that's so, then we will obviously participate in that.", "But I think in many cases there is room to negotiate within the existing contract framework to come into I would say mutually agreeable solution, which will be acceptable both for us and for our customers.", "Angie Sedita", "All right. Thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks Angie.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Ole.", "Ole Slorer", "Yes morning, morning. So let\u2019s get back to West Texas again, you highlighted that you see growth in Middle East, in Russia and in North America land, Middle East and Russia, you clearly very well associated to that, maybe North America land, not so much.", "So you talked about -- so how do you first of all see your positioning and you talked about mobilizing equipment in big ability to drill longer laterals, can you talk a little bit about pricing and tightness and how you get paid for this mobilization.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, what we're mobilizing are drilling tools, which isn't excessively expensive right. So we do that and we also will take some for manufacturing and this is all manufactured in the -- or partly manufactured in the U.S. as well.", "So in terms of the reason for mobilizing more equipment into the drilling side is clearly that we have a clear path towards profitability. So given the unique technology offering we have and the technical challenges of drilling these very, very long horizontals we are able to get pricing which is going to give us I think ultimately the returns that we're looking for.", "And this is why we are prepared to put more capacity into play on the drilling side or what's going on in West Texas. As I said on the fracturing side, still there is no clear path towards profitability and this is why we are still maintaining presence and basically holding the fort until we believe we can justify putting more capacity into play going forward.", "Ole Slorer", "Thanks for that. And if we look at 2017, when you've heard out of oil in London companies like Total talked very aggressively about stepping up activity next year, taking advantage of low oilfield services costs others like BP have been very vocal also of getting going, yet you highlight Russia and Middle East areas where these companies I think all these type of companies are typically not all that active.", "So does this mean that you have a different view or you don't believe that's kind of the type of IOC will step it up or is that they're coming from a very low base at the end of the year and sequentially will be improving from here but year-over-year be kind of flat. Could you help us a little bit with making sense of some of those statements?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, as I was trying to cover in the fairly detailed description I gave of the international markets, we believe that there is early signs of recovery in most places around the world. If you look at next year for international, we expect solid growth year-over-year in the Middle East and Russia on a full year basis.", "But we also see, I would say an uptick in investment and activity in Latin America and in Europe, Africa. The only place where we don't see any signs of recovery at this stage is in Asia. But I would say the uptick in Latin America and Europe, Africa, is more going to be from current Q3 activity levels. It might not be a significant increase on a full-year basis, but I think we have reached bottom in both of those regions, which would warrant higher activity.", "So I'm not contradicting what the IOCs are saying and we welcome obviously more activity and higher investments from them. It's just that the main very clear investment increases we are seeing are still going to be in Russia and the Middle East, but our early signs of things picking up from bottom also in the rest of the world excluding Asia.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay. Thanks for clarifying Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks Ole.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Good", "Scott Gruber", "Yes. Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Scott Gruber", "Question for Scott, you highlighted the Point 8 book to bill, which I believe was for OneSubsea that this foreshadowed growth into 2018. The shorter cycle businesses though at Cameron should be expanding at this point as well at least that forecast.", "However, when I look back at a recent investor presentation, case for Cameron revenue in 2018 is actually flat and the midpoint looks like it was down a bit. Has the outlook for Cameron now improved, is there a line of sight to growth in 2018 assuming the short cycle businesses came over the course of 2017.", "Robert Scott Rowe", "Yes, thanks for the question on Cameron. Just to clarify right, we are in the earnings press release, we're giving the OneSubsea and the drilling bookings and backlog and what you can see there is on the book to bill, the point 8 was meant to be for both drilling systems and OneSubsea. So actually OneSubsea is higher than that and we're just below one on the OneSubsea side.", "But on 2018 general guidance for revenue and growth for the Cameron Group it really depends on those short cycle businesses and win activity returns and so there is a path for growth in '18, but it depends on that land business in Vietnam and in the services segment.", "We're highly focused on growing in the Middle East. We\u2019re highly focused are growing in Midcontinent there in the United States and if we can see continued rig count increase, then we do have a path for growth.", "Now obviously, the drilling business with the backlog numbers there will continue to decline and OneSubsea quite frankly has been relatively flat since the beginning of the deepwater downturn, which started in 2014, and so we will lose a lot of revenue traction on OneSubsea. It will really come from drilling and then the offset is the shorter cycle business growth on the land markets.", "Scott Gruber", "Got it. And an unrelated follow-up on the expanding opportunity in SPM. There's been a willingness to take on some oil price risk in SPM and link at least certain number of payments to oil price. Paal, can you shed some color on just what percentage of the SPM portfolio as in oil price linkage now and where you would be comfortable taking that percentage over time.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well if you look in our contract structure today, I would say the lion's share of this is basically a fee per barrel, which is obviously the project has a link to the oil price, but our compensation is generally linked to the incremental production times of 60 per barrel.", "Now at this stage at the bottom of the cycle, we are in some cases considering a share production times the oil price rather than the fee per barrel the times the entire incremental production. But as based on individual projects, but I would say the portfolio as it stands today is generally fee per barrel not directly exposed oil price, but we are considering some of the -- in some of the cases today to take a bit more oil price risk. If we can make the project work at current oil prices, we are fairly comfortable opening up and balancing the portfolio a bit with a bit more oil price risk.", "Scott Gruber", "Will it always remain a minority of the book?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I would say generally that would be the philosophy, yes.", "Scott Gruber", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead", "Bill Herbert", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Bill. ", "Bill Herbert", "Yes. So SPM, back to SPM, sorry Paal at this stage, do you think SPM investments in 2017 are going to be up over 2016 which has been a fairly big year? ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Sorry, I couldn't hear what was going to be up? ", "Bill Herbert", "SPM, the question is whether your capital investment in SPM in 2017 is going to be up over 2016 which is thus far been a pretty big year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think it is too early to say. I would say as a starting point, I would say probably not maybe, maybe somewhat in line, but I think it's going to depend on the opportunities that we have in front of us. Obviously there is a broad range of discussions. I think for the right opportunities I'm prepared to invest more into it, but I think we will have to do that on a case by case basis.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay. And then secondly, at this stage given your outlook for global E&P CapEx, which frankly sales more constructive than I was expecting, which is good, do you think that Schlumberger's revenues in 2017 overall are going to be up?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, it's a bit early to say. We're still in Q3. The absolute E&P investment numbers for next year, I think it's still early to comment on absolute numbers.", "Bill Herbert", "Yes.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I can give you some direction and I think in terms of revenue, see the trends going and what the absolute number is going to be, is going to be more a function of how the numeric of these trends play out, but we do expect on a full year basis, solid year-over-year growth in North America land, Russia and the Middle East. These are fairly predictable plans that we have in place. ", "We also expect to see modest growth from the current levels, not necessarily on a full-year basis, but from current levels in Europe, Africa and Latin America and the reason for this is that there are many significant oil producing countries in these two regions, which have a record low investment levels at this stage and we see signs that at least we're going to come off the bottom here. Whether that's going to translate into year-over-year growth, it's too early to say, but at least an increase from where we are today.", "And really the only place where we don't see any of these recovery signs as of yet is in Asia. So, all depending on what the various numbers on these three main trends pan out to be. There is a chance that revenue could be up. Obviously, that's what we are hoping for and that's what we're going to work towards and obviously market share and some of the other things that we are working on specifically are on the land rig introduction, around SPM and some of the early production facility work that we do.", "We have opportunities I would say to come in with higher revenue in 2017, but I'm not going to commit to this as of yet. I think we need to work out the details of the plans over the coming two, three months and we can give you a further update in January.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks Bill.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson", "Thanks. Hey Paal in your remarks you commented that you have two rigs of the future in the fourth quarter in the U.S. That seems well ahead of schedule, most of its surprised is to be deployed in the U.S. So, here is two question, are you in fact ahead of schedule on this technology and two, can you talk about kind of where what types of feel this is going into, I am a little surprised it was going to be in the U.S. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well so I would say that generally we are on track with the -- with both the engineering and the manufacturing of the rig of the future. So these two rigs are I would call them pilot versions. They don\u2019t have all the features of the rig of the future, but they have a significant part of it and we are also going to be operating them around the overall software platform of how we want to do rig of the future going forward.", "So, they are manufactured in the U.S. and that's why we would like to basically put them out in operation close to home at this stage to make sure that we can get all the support and all the feedback from their operational performance and feed out into both the engineering and manufacturing work that is going on for the I would say the complete version of the rig, which is going to be rolled out and a number of them in 2017, that's already in the plans for them both the CapEx and the manufacturing for next year.", "David Anderson", "Okay. And then also in your release you talked about the continued free cash flow conversion and your ability to reinvest in the business. Can you expand a bit of what that means? Obviously you're reinvesting here -- you're putting money into the rig of the future. But is there other areas that you're kind of focused on to reinvest here? Is it a product? Is it a geography or is it something else you're talking about?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Simon you want to comment.", "Simon Ayat", "Okay. I \u2018m going to take this question. As we always said that the utilization of cash, the priority would be for the good of the business. As you know we are -- we ended the quarter with about $11 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And today we are very -- our growth of opportunities compared to return of capital to shareholders by given through buybacks.", "Our investments, the three elements of the CapEx, which remain to be very well tightly controlled, we are investing today almost 50% what we used to be at the height of the business and SPM and multi-client. So there is no other opportunities other than our inorganic growth it proves to be a viable proposition economically and the future of the business, but right now our priority is the growth of the business and other than that we would return it to shareholders.", "David Anderson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "Great. Hey, good morning. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Kurt.", "Kurt Hallead", "Hey, Paal your commentary here in the press release and the results seem to be incrementally positive at least on the reservoir front driven by multi-client, it appears. I know in your prior commentary on the cycle recovery, the reservoir piece of the business would probably lag in growth. Is there a shift underway subtle or otherwise in seismic activity that might push reservoir up a little bit further on the recovery curve?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "So, I don\u2019t think there is yet a big turnaround I would say in the exploration market or in the seismic market. But I think we have positioned ourselves very well in both of those markets. Whatever work there is I think we are able to generally pick up on the exploration side and I think on seismic, as I again said in July, the performance of WesternGeco in a very, very tough market is quite commendable.", "We do quite well on both marine and land and we have been quite opportunistic on the multi-client side to make a significant investment in several basins around the world in particular Mexico, but also Gulf of Mexico and the U.S. part as well as overseas and obviously at this stage, we are able to generate revenue and profits from these investments, which you see very clearly in our results.", "So there is no I would say significant market turnaround, but I think it's a strong performance from the exploration related businesses that we have, including seismic and also within the testing services product line, which fits in reservoir characterization, we have won a series of early production facility projects where we have combined the capabilities that we had within the testing services prior with the processing capabilities that Cameron had.", "And this is again really strengthening the offering we have in this market and we see that also as a significant growth opportunity within characterization.", "Kurt Hallead", "That\u2019s great. My follow-up is you said earlier about if I understood it correctly that you were in a position to potentially go over some market share in North America. I wasn't quite clear on the perspective on the international front. So I was just wondering if you just might be able to go through the thought process on the market share dynamics and how you see that opportunity vis-\u00e0-vis pricing and profitability?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I would say in international market we have, I would say actively pursued market share for the past for the past, I would say 12 to 18 months, I think with reasonable success. I think if you look at Characterization Drilling & Production combined, takeaway Cameron, we have pretty solid revenue evolution in all three international operating areas in the third quarter.", "And I\u2019m quite pleased to see the progress we have made there. Whenever you start aiming to increase your tend to win rate which we now have been focusing on for a good 18 months or so, it takes a bit of time before that translates into actual revenue, but you're starting to see some impact of that.", "Kurt Hallead", "The main -- so there is really no main shift internationally. The main thing I was pointing out for North America is that -- on the drilling side, we now have a clear path in U.S. land towards profitability, based on the technology off-take we're seeing linked to these super laterals and as soon as we can turn a profit we are very keen to grow market share and we've basically shifted the playbook from holding the fort to going for market share in drilling in U.S. land, but we have not yet done that for fracing because at this stage it is highly dilutive to our earnings and at this stage also we are see a clear path towards profitability.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay, that's great clarification. Thanks Paal.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "James Wicklund", "Good morning, guys. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning Jim.", "James Wicklund", "Mexico, you've been shooting seismic there coming into this downturn make a change to constitution more quickly than a lot of us have expected, they've been several different grounds and now you talk about there may be some light at the end of that tunnel in '17 that was always a market of fabulous potential in their budget at rival Petrobras is in the past. Can you talk about how you see Mexico evolving over the next year or two please?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah I think, I share your view of the potential of the market. And I also think we are pretty much close to the bottom of it right. We have had -- we\u2019ve seen a significant reduction in PEMEX activity over the past couple of years. And while this whole, industry reform has been taking place that reduction has not been I would say compensated by additional investments from the emerging international players.", "But as these bid rounds for acreage now has progressed and with the deepwater around coming up, the first deepwater coming up now in December, we see drilling activity picking up in 2017. Again, it might not be a dramatic comeback and we won\u2019t be back to, I would say 2013 levels or 2014 levels anytime soon.", "But I think there is a momentum shift coming in Mexico. It is partly linked to the seismic work that we're doing and the related exploration activity with that, but I think also activity linked to the previous rounds that we've seen both in shallow water and on land as well as the basic PEMEX activity should pick up in 2017.", "James Wicklund", "So more enduring recovery. Okay. Thank you. A follow-up if I could, one of the first comment you made on the call Paal was you're not allocating assets to work that doesn't meet your return hurdles and you said the process has started.", "We've seen a number of companies decide not to participate in markets or product lines or with customers where they don't generate an adequate return. Can you talk about a little bit level down in granularity what exactly that means and what we should expect to see in that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, so first of all, when you're in a cyclical business, you will have to be pragmatic when you are near or at bottom of the cycle. So, which we are and we are basically maintaining our presence, pretty much everywhere in the world at this stage even at bottom and even though we have a number of contracts, which at this stage does not our meet our medium to long-term return criteria.", "But what we are saying though is that as we now are starting to come off bottom as oil prices are starting to move upwards, then we will need to have these discussions with the customers, where we have these type of contracts and try to find a way where we can get pricing and terms and conditions and a work scope that will enable us to meet those financial return criteria at the same time, as our customers can also meet theirs.", "So I think these are the discussions that now are taking place. This won't be resolved over night, but we are very clear on the fact that if we have to deploy capacity investments and expertise, there has to be return in it and at the bottom, we are willing to compromise. But as we come off bottom, we need to basically restore the return expectations that we have as a company and as our shareholders have in order to drive the business forward.", "James Wicklund", "Okay. Thank you very much guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sean Meakim", "Hi, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Sean Meakim", "Thinking about OneSubsea how are you seeing opportunities for larger projects shaping up for next year or do you see it as mostly a Brownfield tieback boosting type of market for 2017?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, let me -- it\u2019s a good question and it's a market that's in a state of change right now, but let me just talk about deepwater in general. It's continued to be challenged and in this quarter we saw five additional rigs get stacked. They are in Q3 and deepwater rig utilization dropped to 55% in the month of September. So you expect 2016 deepwater drilling activity as a whole to be down 33%.", "And when you think about that for OneSubsea and Project as we go forward we think this year tree award is significantly under a 100 and when we look at our project list, we're tracking between anywhere between five and eight awards that could happened in 2017 and those would be the larger style awards that we've seen traditionally.", "But our focus really now has shifted to the tieback market and we do see a lot of opportunities on that. I mentioned our eight paid studies with Subsea 7 where we're doing a lot of work on the tieback side and what we think there is that, with a standardized Subsea Tree, which is a at a significantly reduced cost a single well boosting system, which we're the only ones right now that have that single well boosting system.", "Combined that now with our Unified Control System and the installation from Subsea 7, we think we've got a very economical package to tie back one and two wells in the existing host facility.", "So we had a lot of discussions around that and we really it's almost creating a market right now and so we hope that we can give some more excitement and more awards around that as we transition into '17 and then as these big projects kind of progress and move forward, we're offsetting that with this expanded tieback market.", "Sean Meakim", "Got it. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just thinking about capital deployment going forward, and the free cash flow profile of the business, is it fair to say that following transformation of the cost reduction, the capital intensity of the core services business should remain below historical levels, you just think about, how you think about the capital deployed for that part of the business stay below D&A next year as well.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, so I think, based on what we are focusing on from the transformation standpoint, we still have a long runway to go in terms of driving asset utilization for the existing asset base and also what we have going in our engineering programs as well to also engineer and manufacture less expensive assets is also a key part of it.", "So both utilization and the cost per asset, I think should lead to a light or capital intensity of our business going forward. I think you've seen the signs of it in the past two, three years and we are going to continue to work very hard on further improving on that. ", "Sean Meakim", "Great, thanks Paal.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2016 results conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board Meeting.", "Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Scott Rowe, President, Cameron Group.", "Our prepared comments will be provided by Simon, Scott and Paal. Simon will first review the financial results, then Scott will provide an update on the Cameron business, integration and synergies, and then Paal will discuss the operational and technical highlights.", "However, before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.", "Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found on our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. We welcome your questions after the prepared statements.", "I'll now turn the call over to Simon.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.", "Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.27. This represents an increase of $0.02 sequentially and a decrease of $0.38 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $536 million of restructuring charges, $76 million of Cameron related merger and integration charges, and the $63 million charge relating to the devaluation of the Egyptian Pound.", "The restructuring charges largely relate to workforce reduction and facility closure, plus as we continue to rationalize our support structure and reduce our facility footprint. All of these charges are described in our earnings press release.", "Our fourth-quarter revenue of $7.1 billion increased 1% sequentially, primarily driven by the production group.", "Pretax operating margins only declined by 21 basis points sequentially to 11.4%. This was largely due to the revenue mix. Margins also benefited from the continued cost management actions across the entire organization.", "Sequential highlights by product group were as follows; fourth quarter reservoir characterization revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially, as increases in testing and process and [SIS] were offset by declines in wireline and WesternGeco. Pre-tax operating margin decreased 49 basis points to 18.6% as the increased contribution from software sales were more than offset by the decrease in high margin wireline activity.", "Drilling group revenue of $2 billion was also flat sequentially, although margin increased 81 basis points to 11.6%. The margin improvement was primarily driven by the revenue mix and strong cost control.", "Production group revenue of $2.12 billion increased 5%, while margin increased 134 basis points to [6%]. These increases were driven by stronger welfare activity both in the Middle East and [Indiscernible].", "Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion was essentially flat as increases in OneSubsea and surface were offset by lower drilling and balance and measurement activity. Margins decreased 207 basis points due to the drop in drilling projects. Cameron was accretive to both Schlumberger\u2019s pre-tax operating margin as well as earnings per share in 2016.", "Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 15.8% in the fourth quarter, essentially the same as Q2. Looking forward, the ETR would be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. We anticipate that the ETR will gradually increase over the course of 2017 as a result of the expected improvement in activity in North America.", "Our cash flow generation continues to be very strong. During all of 2016, we generated $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations. During the fourth quarter we generated $2 billion of cash flow from operation. This is all despite paying severance payments of approximately $150 million during the fourth quarter and making $950 million of severance and transaction-related payments associated with the acquisition of Cameron during 2016. Although receivable collection improved in Q4, we continue to experience payment delays from some of our customers.", "Our net debt improved by $46 million on a sequential basis to $10.1 billion. During 2016, we returned $3.4 billion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. We have also increased our dividend in seven of the last 10 years. As you know, every January we review the dividend with our board. Given the current situation and our level of the [operation] we have decided to maintain our dividend at $0.50 per quarter. This will provide us with the flexibility to continue to invest in the business and take advantage of several opportunities as they present themselves. We will continue to return excess cash that we generate through our buyback program.", "During the fourth quarter we spent $116 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $78.21. For the full year of 2016 we spent $778 million to repurchase 11 million shares at an average price of [$70.08] per share. As a reminder, last year our board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program, which will take effect once our current program is exhausted this year.", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $654 million on Capex, and invested approximately $160 million in SPM projects, $130 million in multi-client projects. Full year 2017 Capex, excluding multiclient and SPM investment, is expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, and now I turn the conference over to Scott.", "Robert Scott Rowe", "Thank you, Simon. The Cameron Group had another good quarter under Schlumberger, and I am pleased to report that we continue to exceed expectations with the integration. I will give you a brief update on the fourth quarter and the full year, as well as provide some comments as to how we are thinking about 2017.", "We delivered $1.3 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, which was flat sequentially despite the reduced backlog. EBIT margins were a healthy 14% but lower than Q3 by 200 basis points, which is consistent with our prior thinking and communication on the last earnings call. The lower margin is driven by the reduced volumes in our higher-margin drilling business coupled with reduced pricing throughout the downturn that is now fully flowing through the system.", "OneSubsea, however, continued to have outstanding margins, which exceeded 20% for the second straight quarter. Our persistent focus on cost control and the acceleration of the integration program has allowed us to deliver high relative margins throughout 2016. While the Cameron Group backlog decline began in the fourth quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remained flat sequentially at 0.8. Additionally we had several major awards in the quarter that demonstrate market-leading positions and our ability to capitalize on the limited opportunity in the marketplace.", "In our drilling business, we received two different long-term service contracts, totaling more than $350 million from Transocean. Schlumberger will be providing comprehensive services to ensure maximum uptime and reliability of the Cameron pressure control systems on their rig. The structure of these contracts [Indiscernible] of the service provider, drilling contractor and operator.", "Additionally we will be deploying the latest technology on censors, diagnostics and condition based monitoring to drive further reliability and uptime in deepwater drilling. This type of collaboration will systematically help to drive down the cost of deepwater developments and potentially unlock future projects.", "While secured in the fourth quarter, this award was not booked in the fourth quarter, and will be booked over the life of the 10-year contract. The reduction in the drilling backlog of $258 million was primarily driven by the removal of five of the seven [Brazil] blowout preventer orders in the amount of $128 million, which we believe are unlikely to progress given the current issues in Brazil.", "OneSubsea received two significant awards in the quarter as well. One award was for the industry\u2019s first deepwater integrated subsea engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning of a multi-phase boosting system for the Dalmatian field in Gulf of Mexico for Murphy Oil Company. Working with Subsea 7 we will deploy, install and commission a 35 km tieback, multiphase boosting system to augment natural production for the Dalmatian field.", "OneSubsea also booked our first subsea tree for Statoil. While we have had a long relationship with Statoil, we had previously not participated in their subsea production systems project. The award of the two well of Utgard project was the result of a multiyear effort to prove our technology and execution capability to Statoil. We are very happy to be working with Statoil on this project and we expect to continue working with Statoil to drive cost reductions and improve productivity on their future projects.", "Our [Vietnam] and surface business responded to the increased activity in North America last quarter, and we predict that these two businesses will outperform in the second half of 2017 given their strong market positions coupled with their broad international reach. The integration of Cameron into Schlumberger has been an enormous task. Most of the heavy lifting in the integration is now complete. We achieved our year one target of $300 million of synergies in the first 10 months of the acquisition and we fully expect to exceed the $600 million target for the second year. The transaction was again accretive in the fourth quarter as well as accretive to the full year results for Schlumberger.", "We booked $118 million of synergy-related business in the fourth quarter with the majority of it coming from the Middle East. We will continue to have an integration team in 2017, and our focus will shift from cost synergies to growth synergies. Several technologies will be commercialized in 2017 that will drive incremental revenue and margin.", "Finally, we continue to find opportunities around the world and [Indiscernible] expansive footprint of Schlumberger. The first quarter will be a low for the Cameron Group in both revenue and margins due to the reduced backlog and the normal cyclical nature of our business. However, I expect the Cameron Group to grow continually from the second quarter onwards as we leverage our North American position and capitalize on the growth from our expanded international presence under Schlumberger.", "In summary, 2016 was a challenging year for the Cameron Group as we worked through the downturn and integrated into Schlumberger. However, I could not be more pleased with the approach by Schlumberger throughout this integration and with the performance of the Cameron people and organization. Despite the challenges, we delivered strong results throughout the year and we are positioned better than any of our peers to fully capitalize on the growing opportunity in 2017.", "I'll now turn it over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Scott and good morning, everyone. Our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 increased 1% sequentially to reach $7.1 billion as growth in North America land and robust activity in the Middle East largely offset continued weakness in Latin America and seasonal declines in other parts of the world.", "Our overall activity and financial performance led to a second successive quarter with a small but positive increase in earnings per share. In parallel with this operational stabilization we have completed the restructuring of the company, which in the fourth quarter included a further reduction of our global support structure to reflect current activity to capacity and customer pricing levels.", "These latest actions follow the well established playbook we have used to navigate the unprecedented industry challenges faced over the past two years. In this our focus has been on proactively streamlining our cost and support structure and continuing to drive the underlying efficiency and quality of all our business workflows.", "In parallel, we have also significantly expanded our offering through continued investments in [R&E] and a strategic M&A program, and through these actions we have further strengthened our market position compared to when we entered the downturn two years ago.", "Next I will review the fourth quarter business trends from our global operations and I will focus my comments on the results and activities for the Characterization Drilling & Production Groups as Scott has already covered the performance of the Cameron Group.", "In North America, overall revenue increased 4% sequentially driven by an improving land business in the US and Western Canada as drilling and completions activity increased and service pricing started to recover. In terms of technology, we saw the strongest growth on land in pressure pumping, followed by directional drilling, drill bits and drilling fluids as well as ESP, PCP and [rodless] product line.", "Offshore revenue declined again sequentially as the recon dropped further and pricing remained under pressure in spite of the significant technical and operational challenges in this market. The resulting business environment is potentially becoming unsustainable for us and will either lead to a recovery in service pricing or a narrowing of our service offering with re-deployment of resources to markets that offer more adequate returns.", "Internationally revenue was up 1% sequentially as strong activity in the Middle East was partially able to offset the combination of continued weakness in Latin America and seasonal slowdowns in other parts of the world. In Latin America, revenue declined 4% sequentially driven by Mexico, where further budget constraints impacted activity and by Argentina where unfavorable weather conditions and continued union actions led to significant activity disruption.", "On the positive side, our integrated project activity in Ecuador remained strong and we saw as expected stronger conventional land drilling activity in Colombia as WTI oil prices climbed above $50.", "Revenue in Europe, CIS and Africa decreased 2% sequentially due to the seasonal slowdown in activity in Norway and [Indiscernible] while activity in the rest of Russia and Europe as well as in North Africa was essentially flat. In sub-Saharan Africa revenue was marginally down due to anticipated project completions but we are now seeing a floor in activity and expect the recovery process to start in the coming quarters.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue increased 5% sequentially driven by strong drilling and completions activity on land in the Gulf region. At the same time activity in Asia weakened further in the fourth quarter, but now appears to have bottomed out and we therefore expect a slow recovery to start also here in the coming quarters.", "As we now move into the recovery part of the cycle, I would like to turn to the developing macro-environment and what this means for our business. First of all we maintain our constructive view of the oil market as supply and demand continued to tighten in the fourth quarter as demonstrated by the OECD oil stocks, which declined for the fourth month in a row in November. This tightening is partly driven by strong demand where the reporting agencies revised their global demand growth figures upwards in the fourth quarter, and now stand at around 1.5 million barrels per day in 2016 and between 1.3 and 1.6 million barrels per day in 2017.", "From the supply-side, non-OPEC production remains under pressure seen by the large year-over-year drop in North American production, which as of December had fallen by more than 600,000 barrels per day versus 2015. Over the same period new production from the completion of long-term large projects in Brazil, Kazakhstan and Russia was offset by falling production from Mexico, China and Colombia to result in a year-over-year reduction of 900,000 barrels per day for non-OPEC production.", "In terms of OPEC supply, production surged to record levels in the fourth quarter to meet the increase in demand and to offset the falling non-OPEC production. This lowered spare capacity down to 2 million barrels per day in November, which is barely 2% of global production represents a 12-year low. The OPEC agreement to reduce production by a significant volume of 1.6 to 1.8 million barrels per day has now established a floor to the oil prices and should accelerate the tightening of the oil market going forward.", "These supply reductions will take a few months to work their way through the distribution system, but we expect to see an acceleration of global stock floors towards the end of the first quarter. Meanwhile over the next several months, oil prices are expected to fluctuate around current levels until a steady reduction in crude inventories is fully established.", "As the up-cycle begins, growth in E&P investments will be led by the North America land operators who appear to remain unconstrained by years of negative free cash flow as external funding seems more readily available and the pursuit of shorter-term equity value takes precedence over a full cycle return.", "E&P spending surveys currently indicate that 2017 North America E&P investments will increase by around 30% led by the Permian basin, which should lead to both higher activity and a long overdue recovery in service industry pricing. In the international markets, the recovery will start slower driven by the constraints of the international E&P industry where the various operator groups determine their investment levels based on full cycle returns and their available free cash flow.", "At current oil price levels this will result in the third successive year of lower Capex spend, which will further weaken the state of the international production base. Over the past two years there has been very few [FID] approvals of new sizeable oil development and outside of the Gulf countries most of the international production is today depleting producible reserves with little or no reserves replacement.", "This is equivalent to borrowing barrels from the future. As a result, the activity and Capex required going forward to replenish reserves in order to uphold production for the medium to long term will be much higher than the current decline rates may suggest. This concerning trend cannot be reversed or mitigated by North America unconventional resources alone, which currently represents only around 5% of global crude production.", "The future supply challenges of the industry can only be addressed by a broad increase in global investment. Therefore as international E&P cash flow improves in the coming quarters we expect to see E&P investments accelerate in all main producing regions leading into 2018. So what does this macro-setting mean for Schlumberger?", "First we are very excited about our global opportunity set. Following nine consecutive quarters of relentless workforce reduction, cost cutting and restructuring efforts we are looking forward to restoring focus on the pursuit of growth and improved returns for our shareholders. And as outlined earlier we will launch our pursuit from a competitive platform that is even stronger than what it was a few years ago.", "In North America, our strategy during this downturn has been to preserve our infrastructure footprint on land, while reducing and stocking operating capacity to minimize financial losses during the trough of the cycle at the expense of market share. This has served us well in the past year.", "In parallel with this, we have continued to invest in the underlying efficiency of our operations as well as in new technologies and further vertical integration. As the market now starts to recover we will aggressively redeploy our ideal capacity in any product line and in any basin that shows a clear path towards profitability. This together with a strong market position of the Cameron product line will allow us to further expand the North America leadership position being held in recent years in terms of both margin and pre-tax operating income.", "Next, our international business is currently like a highly compressed coil spring. Activity levels in key market segments such as exploration and deep water are at record lows and although we do not expect a dramatic short term recovery the trends can only be positive from this point on.", "In terms of geography, it is worthwhile to note that the earnings contributions from key international markets like Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Sub-Sahara Africa, China and Russia land have collectively dropped by more than 70% from Q4 of 2014 to Q4 of 2016, which by self represents a huge upside as the international recovery starts to unfold.", "In terms of our international operating capacity, the only way we have been able to protect cash flow and profitability in the international market has been to [Indiscernible] equipment and delay in major maintenance and repairs until the equipment is again needed. This means that we do not currently have any significant spare capacity available.", "Furthermore, given the major pricing concessions we have been forced to give, we have also had to reduce the technical support levels that we normally provide beyond our contractual obligations under both our operating assets and technical support towards customers who allow us to make a reasonable return.", "Going forward, however we can reactivate our equipment capacity and expand our support structure relatively quickly but we will only do so where it makes financial sense. In addition, we are now requesting pricing increases on contracts where the efforts we have made have helped bridge the trough of the cycle for our customers but where the contract holds no promise of delivering the returns we would expect in the current improving business environment.", "Over the past few years we have also expanded our addressable market by more than 50% with a series of acquisitions combined with internal R&E investment. Our offering now includes special control, drilling equipment, land rigs, infrastructure and surface processing facility.", "In addition, we have closed a number of new [STMB] and we continue to see a broad wing of this opportunity set given our integration capabilities, balance sheet strength and cash flow position. All of these new markets carry significant growth potential with unique technology, business models and integration opportunities that will facilitate both market share gains and improving returns for Schlumberger in the coming years. Furthermore, we are consistently able to convert our international market leadership into superior earnings generation as seen by our share of the top four service companies operating income which increased from 60% in 2014 to over 80% in the three first quarters of 2016.", "Another way to look at this is that for every dollar EMP spend spend in the international market we generate around four times the operating income of our closest competitor. This is due to our present operating scale and executional capabilities which together with our leverage towards the international market demonstrate the upstart we had in terms of earnings per share going forward.", "While earnings stores is a very important part of our financial performance full cycle cash generation is even more critical and here we continue to stand out in the wider industry. Over the past two years of this downturn we have generated $7.5 billion in free cash flow which is more than the rest of our competitors combined.", "Furthermore we have returned this entire month to our shareholders with dividends and share buyback. Finally, the breadth of our technology and integration offering together with our unmatched size and global footprint gives us an operating platform that enables us to support our customers in every corner of the world and through this capture more growth opportunities than any of our competitor.", "With this focus and ambition in mind, our management team and wider organization entered a new phase of the cycle with renewed energy and a spring in our [Indiscernible] fully resolved. Thank you.", "Simon Farrant", "Greg, we\u2019ll now open up for Q&A", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "James West", "Hey good morning, Paul.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, James.", "James West", "I thought you made some pretty compelling comments around the international side of your business near the coiled spring and also the reductions that you have seen in some major oil market which I was actually surprised to help big reductions that worked. It seems to me know though that you have better visibility at least on the international recovery and while stock markets may not be up year-over-year they will be up 4Q to 4Q 2017, could you perhaps touch on the visibility when you expect certain market to improve and if you have any views on the slope of the improvement that would be helpful as well?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I mean, I can give some general comments. Obviously, visibility for the full year of 2017 is still not all the way where we would like it to be. But what is fair is that the recovery is on unexplainable market and all markets have now reach the bottom including Sub-Sahara Africa and Asia, so I would say excluding the seasonal slowdown in Q1, it should be up from here in basically all markets, but the pace and the timing is still somewhat uncertain.", "Now, I think the key here is that we look at 2017 as a starting point of a new multiyear cycle, where the main challenge is actually going to be reverse the effect of several years of Global E&P underinvestment and then try to mitigate the pending supply shortage that we see unfolding. But the only way to achieve this is through broad-based increase in global E&P investments as North America and non-conventional production is not going to be able to address this pending supply issues by itself.", "So, in terms of how use of the markets are going to develop, the main thing we're doing now is we are preparing for a global recovery and we are really aiming at being ready to support our customers in every market around the world at these start to recover at varying point in time and at varying pace. So it\u2019s a bit early to say exactly what\u2019s going to happen in each one of them, but we are preparing and we are aiming to be ready as they kick in each one of them. I think the main thing I would commit to though is that we are basically aiming to drive earning growth as faster than our competitors in every market that we\u2019re in.", "E&P spend and revenue is very important, but ultimately matters in the next phase is the ability to generate earnings and here we are very confident that we should to outperform our surroundings in every markets that we participate in including North America.", "James West", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, maybe a follow-up for Simon, the level of share repurchases has been lower than I would have expected here given the improving visibility, improving oil prices. Could you maybe comment on what level we should expect in the future, if you will be ramping that up, or if there's other investments that are more attractive like SPM or perhaps an M&A pipeline?", "Simon Ayat", "So, James, you\u2019re right, its take a bit of a break on the buyback during the last few months. However if you look at our payout ratio including dividend, we are at a very high level. And we look at the situation by looking at our pre-cash flow generation and the opportunities ahead of us. I know that everyone think that we have some excess cash and we do as compared to historically, but we have a lot of opportunities that we see coming our way.", "In terms of projects, businesses and some strategic transactions, so 2017 in our opinion is going to provide a lot of these opportunities and we want to be ready to participate into them. As far as buyback we will always use excess to do buyback. And yes when the opportunity presents itself, we will accelerate this. But you can count on us continue to return to our shareholders a very significant part of the free cash flow and the operating cash flow, but we will, when the opportunity present itself accelerate the buyback.", "James West", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.", "Simon Ayat", "Thanks, James.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Angie Sedita", "So, Paal, maybe I could start off with SPM and you highlighted it in your comments and maybe you could talk a little bit about some of the opportunities you are seeing in the market as far as the type of opportunities and regions of the world that you are seeing some opportunities and just your long-term thoughts about the importance of SPM to Schlumberger?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think this is an opportunities that is continuing to expand. And we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been in this market or been operating around these type of business models now for over a decade. We start off very slowly and we have accelerated in recent years as our capabilities have grown and has the opportunity that has also widen.", "Today, we are basically engaged in discussions and negotiations all around the world. We have around 20 countries that we are discussing SPM opportunities. There\u2019s a range of the type of opportunities in terms of both size and resources, but I would say the general focus we have SPM is the mature fields oil on land, that\u2019s main focus area.", "And if you look at the size of SPM today, it is a size of an average product line within the company and what we\u2019ve said, which I\u2019ll repeat is that I think over a reasonable amount of time I would say three to five years the growth potential is significant for SPM and I think it has the potential to grow from being a product line to becoming the size of the group. So a sign growth opportunity, but it is going to be something that will complement the rest of the company. Our base business in terms of the individual product lines for individual services and products is still going to be the lion share of what we provide to our customer.", "Angie Sedita", "Okay, great. Great, thanks, very helpful. And then you made some comments on U.S. pricing, so maybe you could talk a little bit about what you are thinking on the outlook for pricing for frac in the U.S. and is there any other pricing opportunities in the U.S., particularly directional drilling?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I would say, where we probably have had the most pricing traction is on directional drilling actually. So we \u2013 as I mentioned on the Q3 call we were already sold out on PowerDrive Orbit, our rotary steerable systems that we are deploying in them in U.S. land, and the trend of increasing lateral length which is further accelerating the uptake of this technology. So we were sold out at the end of Q3. We have added pretty significant capacity in Q4 and we\u2019re still sold out. So this is the market segment that we\u2019re actually see the biggest price increase and following on from that we\u2019re also seeing a very good growth in both our drill bits business and the drilling fluid business.", "So that part we\u2019re already performing quite well and so I\u2019m pleased with that. On the fracing side, yes pricing is moving now, we need significantly more pricing before we are getting into I would say a sustainable operating environment, but that trend has been kicked off, we are actively high grading our contract portfolio, and we have active pricing discussions I would say with all customers at this stage, so that process has started and will continue in the coming quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer", "Yes. Thank you. And thanks for the color on 2017. But I wonder whether it would be possible to help me a little bit on the bridge from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. There are some tricky seasonalities in Russia, North Sea and you also have positive seasonality in Canada and pricing momentum in North America land. So how should we think about the move from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, also taking into account the multi-client seismic seasonality and product sales?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It\u2019s a fair question, Ole. I think you hit on the main point that I would highlight as well. I mean the Q1 visibility is actually still somewhat limited. There are lot of moving parts including the main impact of the normal seasonal drop-in activity, right. Now with that you also have some positives which is not the growth in North America. So I\u2019m not going to give you a specific number, but I would say that there is going to be the normal seasonal drop, but there are most I think factors as well which is a strong North America performance as well as probably less of a Q1 impact when it comes to the yearend sales that we\u2019ve seen in previous years. So I\u2019d so not ready to give you a number, but we are generally optimistic about the outlook for the coming year.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay. So consensus isn't entirely unreasonable?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "As I said I\u2019m not going to give you a specific number.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay. Scott, I wonder if you could fill us in a little bit more on what you talked about and congrats with the first contract with Statoil. Just coming back from Europe, having met with a lot of the large oil companies over there, it sort of struck me to what extent the cost structure seems to be changing around at the moment. So could you give us a little bit of a view on what you think the cost structures that -- in the Bering Sea, we heard $40 and the well costs have dropped meaningfully as a result of headcount reduction on the rigs because of automation and remote drilling decision?", "So, how should we think about the cost structures and what are you hearing from your customers now? We also get a sense by the way that the cost structures have come down, at least from a cyclical standpoint, to a point where there is little room to squeeze more pricing out?", "Scott Rowe", "Yes. I think everybody knows that there is massive cost inflation in Deepwater projects, all through, basically from 2009 through 2013, and the industry became incredibly challenged in 2013 and 2014, so even before oil price collapse there is a massive cost issue. And I think operators across the world and both small and large, you really started to attack this problem in late 2013. And what I\u2019ve seen in our discussions with our customers is there has been substantial movement here. And so, obviously it starts with the drilling rigs and the drilling contractors. I think everybody knows the status there and the oversupply has driven costs down substantially.", "But then on the infrastructure, right, the production systems and the installation of those, the [surfside] we\u2019ve been able to through cost-reduction, standardization and simplification we\u2019ve been able to get our pricing now back down to levels that we saw back in 2003 and 2004. I really feel comfortable that the price of developing deepwater projects is down substantially. And I think every basin and every reservoir is slightly different, so I\u2019m not going to go into breakeven prices, but what we\u2019re seeing on a regular basis is the ability to unlock developments that were there before.", "Now in that context what I\u2019ll say is, mega projects of 60 plus wells that we saw before and billions and billions of dollars of capital on those projects are not super optimistic that we\u2019re going to have lots of those as we look forward, but what we do feel is that by coming down into a more meaningful size call it between 10 and 20 wells I think operators are going to be able to do just fine there.", "And in the other market that we didn't mention was the tieback market and so we are seeing lots of activity on the Brownfield side we\u2019re adding two wells and potentially a boosting system to that and really driving more production out of that existing field. So on most of optimistic about the Brownfield side, but what I would say is we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re attracting a nice list of projects in that kind of 10 to 20 well development and we\u2019ll see probably two -- at least two times the growth that we had in 2016.", "Ole Slorer", "Thanks for that clarification.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber. Please go ahead.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Scott?", "Operator", "One moment please.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay, great. Let\u2019s move to the next question.", "Operator", "Scott Gruber, your line is open. Please go ahead.", "Scott Gruber", "Can you hear me?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, we can, Scott.", "Scott Gruber", "Great. Scott, a question for you on Cameron. It's great to hear that you have line of sight on the bottom at the segment. Can you just provide some color on where revenues and margins could slip to in 1Q so we can dimension the starting point for future growth?", "Scott Rowe", "Yes. Like Paal said, we\u2019re not giving hard numbers on Q1 guidance, but what I would say is the trend that you\u2019re seeing over the last two quarters were probably on the top line continue in the Q1 and like I said in my prepared comments that we do think that is a low and our shorter cycle business of Valves & Measurement in Surface really start to capitalized on the increased activity in North America but also internationally. And we feel very good about driving growth both topline and bottom line from that going forward.", "Scott Gruber", "Got it. And then I want to come back to the international line of questioning that James began with. Paal, I realize that the 2017 visibility is not perfect, but at a $55 Brent price and some momentum building over the course of the year, is it unreasonable to assume that we could see double-digit, year-on-year growth for the legacy Schlumberger productlines on the international front?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I again will go back to what I said earlier, I think it\u2019s still early to commit the number. I think the current prices and billing of what Scott was saying in terms of several projects having seen, I would say significant cost reductions now. I think there is a basis for investing in the international market, and I think it\u2019s going to be highly necessary in order to address the pending supply issues.", "And the main reason for the slower startup of international is just purely that investments are covered by free cash flow. So I would say that as soon as free cash flow starts to improve for the international operators we will see higher investments, exactly how fast that\u2019s going to happen I think that\u2019s the thing that is a bit difficult for us to predict.", "But the fact that they are good investment opportunities and that there is a need to invest, I think it\u2019s both there. It just the matter of how quickly cash flow generation is going to allow this to happen.", "Scott Gruber", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert", "Good morning. Hey, Scott, can you talk about the margin roadmap for 2017 for Cameron? You referenced that top line would bottom in Q1, but what is a reasonable expectation for a margin trough for Cameron?", "Scott Rowe", "Yes. And again, we\u2019re not providing specific guidance on any other groups there are on where it goes, but I give some color in terms of how and what are the dynamics there and impacting it. So obviously we\u2019ve been able to expand margins in the higher backlog businesses, right. So that was drilling and we saw a lot of those high margins come through in the first half of 2016, but now as that backlog fall it off, we\u2019re still able to keep nice margins because we have the service business, right, so we\u2019re getting parts in there and services which is historically been a higher margin.", "In turns the drilling business shifts to project -- from projects to more services which should be able deserve nice margins. OneSubsea throughout the cycle we\u2019ve been able expand our margins and mostly that\u2019s the pricing from 2012 to 2013 that\u2019s coming through the system while we\u2019re driving cost down. And so, OneSubsea margins will start to decline just because the pricing now is not what it was over the last three years.", "And so -- but we also believe that we can enhance bookings and do some things more creatively with the cost structure that keep relatively high margins in the OneSubsea business. And then for Valves & Measurement and Surface we should after Q1 start to see nice growth both on the top line and at the margin.", "Bill Herbert", "Right. So, I wasn\u2019t actually asking for a level of margin, but basically wondering over the course of the year when should we expect to see sequentially improving margins for Cameron?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "You will see improvements from Q1 to Q2.", "Bill Herbert", "In margins?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then Simon, it\u2019s a question with regard to the ETR, you are guiding for sort of a bleeding higher of tax rates over the course of 2017, does that encompass the prospect of the bending lower of the U.S. Corporate tax rate?", "Simon Ayat", "Well to be honest, we\u2019re not clear what will happen in the future for the corporate tax rate in North America. We hear what you hear that there will be a business friendly tax rate and we are looking forward to it, but no it does not include that kind of retakes, but our comment more relates to the mix of revenue, North America as you know it\u2019s a higher tax rate than international. So once the business shifts to slightly better in North America we would experience higher tax rate and that\u2019s the comment that we make.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay. Thank you.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Muztafago from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.", "Edward Muztafago", "Hey guys, thanks. Question for Scott, just wondering maybe if we could delve a little bit more into the Q4 margin in Cam and specifically the downtick was pretty material, historically we have seen where large project shipments in Q4 can kind of cause some mix effects though maybe I\u2019ll just ask directly if there were any mix effects in the quarter around would have expected maybe that given where margins are at with subsea and the fact that North America is improving that maybe that would have been a little stronger in Q4?", "Robert Scott Rowe", "Yes, mix was a big driver and you see that with the drilling backlogs. The drilling has always been one of our highest margin segments and as that backlog comes down it definitely has a major impact. And the backlog has deteriorated pretty substantially there in the back half of 2016. So that was the biggest movement all of the say and Q3, one Subsea had its highest margin ever, which we knew were not necessarily sustainable from that very lofty peak. And so that\u2019s now come down still in the very high, in the very high levels but it did come off the peak.", "And then on the surface and the V&M businesses where we\u2019ve been able to maintain the margins throughout 2016 and now as we start to grow we need to leverage the revenue growth, but at the same time growing environments we are starting to add people and resources that we are very focused on the profitability as we go forward.", "Edward Muztafago", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. So it\u2019s a typically high margins in 3Q that came down plus the mix and a little bit of perhaps lag in the margin improvement and in some of the shorter cycle businesses.", "Robert Scott Rowe", "I mean that will give...", "Edward Muztafago", "Okay, great, great. And then Paal, really like the spring comment in the international markets, so perhaps we could focus on maybe just one spring in the watch in that Latin America, you have a couple of markets there Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia really operating at very depressed level and historically if we look back at least at the peak anyway won\u2019t there historically Latin America was probably 30% of global land rig account, can you talk about the evolution perhaps of the Latin American land rig market, the land market over the next say 12 months to 24 months?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I would just generally say that if you look at current activity levels, it will come up from where we are today. I think the best example to illustrate this is probably Colombia, where we\u2019ve always maintained that if WTI breaks $50 in a positive direction that should yield a significant increase in land rigs or in overall rig activity. So, actually in the fourth quarter when this oil price event occurred, we almost immediately saw a significant uptick in rig activity in Colombia and we\u2019ve seen actually a dramatic surge in activity in the country over the past few months. I think this is an early indication then you would see similar things happening potentially in Mexico and in Argentina as well.", "Ecuador for us has been strong throughout the downturn driven by the activity on our integrated projects and Venezuela in terms of activity obviously there is significant potential activity there and the reactivation of the business there is purely going to come down to the ability of getting paid. So as I would say that we are the [Indiscernible] there is an early indication of what potentially will occur coming from Colombia and in term of the other land markets I think we\u2019ll follow soon as soon as there is more cash flow available.", "Edward Muztafago", "So could you see Latin America being or a scenario where Latin America is perhaps the surprise market for 2017, or is that perhaps a little bit longer turn in your mind?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No actually I think all parts of the international market has the potential to surprise. I think it is indeed a highly compressed Cold Spring, where it\u2019s going to break out first. I think it\u2019s still kind of offer discussion right. We have a very very solid base line business coming out of Russia as well as the GCC part of the Middle East and I think all other businesses are extremely depressed in terms of activity levels and we expect several of them to show growth and come out of this environment due in the course of 2017 leading into 2018, but exactly which one is going to come first I think it\u2019s a dual effect.", "Edward Muztafago", "Okay, thanks appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.", "Bill Sanchez", "Thanks, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Bill Sanchez", "So Paal your comments with regard to international capacity here and the fact effectively you have no spare capacity. If I look at the CapEx guide for this year, it would suggest that relatively flat with 2016. You don't have much of any expectation I'm guessing in activating currently stacked capacity internationally, I guess number one.", "And number two, what would be the trigger point on your comment for redeploying assets out of North America I guess if returns ultimately weren't suitable for you and what markets most likely will we see those assets venture to?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I think if you look at the CapEx guidance it\u2019s more or less flat with the 2016 and this has been only around 50% of D&A, right. So it\u2019s still low as you indicate. Now, we have two transformation program a continued focus on driving assets utilization from the existing capacity that we have and actually the cost of reactivating the international capacity is not significant. We are just saying that we aren\u2019t going to incur the cost unless there is an adequate financial return, but we can do it pretty fast. It is not exceptive in terms of CapEx investments and a fair bit of this is built into the number that we are guiding to for 2017.", "So in terms of capturing upside growth I think we can capture quite a lot of upside growth even within this CapEx number that we are guiding fee. And when it comes to the potential redeployment capacity there is nothing unique about North America offshore or anything, the only thing we are saying is that we will constantly look at what kind of returns we are getting in the contract that we operate in and some of the high end assets they are quite expensive and they are in potentially high demand and we will continue to look at deploying them where we can get the best return.", "So the redeployment comment was around the offshore business which we have I would say quite limited spare capacity of some of the high end technologies and if we aren\u2019t getting the adequate returns in any part of the world, we will look to shift it around to where we can get the return.", "Bill Sanchez", "Okay. Appreciate the clarification there. I know there has been a lot of questions around top line and thoughts on international. Just curious on prior thoughts around the incremental margins. Paal, you have talked about 65% I think ex-Cameron as being a reasonable incremental assumption. As you see now being able to enter the conversations with your customers on claw backs of these pricing concessions, and I think just your overall outlook, is that still a fair type of incremental margin we should be thinking about 2017 versus 2016?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "While we stand behind that number that we were given. I think in order for that number to be achieved I think we need to get into a kind of a steady line of growth which I think will happen during the course of 2017. It might not be for the full year of 2017. And in addition to that we will need some pricing contribution to that right. So, the 65% incremental as we stand behind and we need to get kind of through the trough which we are basically done with now and it\u2019s just a matter of how we manage this going forward, but we are committed to the number and that\u2019s what we are going to aim to do going forward.", "Bill Sanchez", "I appreciate the time. I will turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And we have time for one last question. Your final question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Timna Tanners", "Yes, hey Happy Friday everyone.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Hey, good morning.", "Timna Tanners", "I just had a quick follow-up with some comments that Simon made earlier. Wanted to know, given that you were making comments about having hit the trough and on an upturn in general for businesses, including international, how do we think about any further cost-cutting. It's been a big positive for the Company having been able to contain margins very well and better than peers, but do we continue to model further cost cutting measures or should we consider ourselves in the final innings there?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well you have seen that we have taken some charges here for further rationalization of our support structure. This is obviously we\u2019ll have a full year impact. Now some of the cost cutting measures that we have taken including our transformation program will have a full year effect in 2017. You will continue to see the management of cost and the cost control that will be ongoing in the company, but as far as the concerned, there is no further action beyond what we have taken, but it will have a full year impact.", "Timna Tanners", "Okay. So no further large cost cutting measures that we should anticipate at current market conditions?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No. Not as far as we are concerned now and based on what we have seen we have taken a chance to further rationalize which will be implemented in the first quarter and it\u2019s already underway but there will be no further cut.", "Timna Tanners", "Got you. And then finally on the follow-up to the commentary about considering exiting contracts or regions that failed to provide an adequate return, I was just curious, can you characterize how some of your competitors behaviors are in those same markets and talk to us about what timeframe you might need to make a decision on whether or not you will continue in less-competitive markets?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I think all parts of the business, North America land, all of international, North America offshore, it\u2019s as usual very competitive. Now there are 15 trends in where pricing is going and generally I would say that there is more focus now I think generally in industry to try to raise prices but it is highly competitive and it\u2019s kind of we take this from bid to bid in terms of how we play this, right. But the behavior from our competitors there is nothing special around that. I think they are challenged similar to us in terms of pricing and profitability levels and we\u2019re coming off a phase of the cycle which has been extremely demanding for old players. I think the \u2013 these are actions that we all wanted to go is that we need to recover some of the pricing concessions that we have given, but again this is highly competitive and it\u2019s a bit difficult to provide general comments, because every bit that we submitted is highly competitive and we are all trying to win them.", "Timna Tanners", "That\u2019s it. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "All right. So before we close this morning, I\u2019d like to summarize the key points that we\u2019ve discussed. First, the market recovery is clearly on its way and we look at 2017 as the starting point of a new multi year cycle that will require a broad based increase in E&P investment in order to reverse the effect of several years of global under investment and mitigate the pending supply shortage. As all cycle will initially be led by North America land, but followed by the international markets later in 2017 and leading into 2018. And while E&P spend and revenue is very important what ultimately matters in the next phase is the ability to drive earnings growth and we commit to delivering faster earnings growth than our competitors in all of the markets we compete in including North America. We have a proven track record of doing just that and our 600 business units spanning the globe are all ready, able and incentivized to deliver on this promise. So after nine quarters of cost cutting and restructuring we are very excited about resuming focus on growth and improving returns for our shareholders. Thank you for participating.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 9:30 Central Time today, through February 20.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Thank you. Hello, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2017 results conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Paris, France, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting. Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice-President New Ventures. We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which we will open up for questions. By way of an agenda, Simon Ayat will first present comments on our second quarter financial performance before Patrick Schorn reviews our results by geography, which may include a discussion on Schlumberger production management. Paul will close our remarks with an updated yield of the industry macro. However, before we begin I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we\u2019ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements.", "I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K and other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website.", "With that, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.35. This represents an increase of $0.10 sequentially and $0.12 when compared to the same quarter last year. During the current quarter, we recorded $0.40 of charges. This primarily relates to Cameron merger and integration charges as well as a financing agreement we entered into with our primary customer in Venezuela.", "We received an interest bearing promissory note in exchange of $700 million of receivables. The accounting rules required us to record this note as its estimated fair value on the date of the exchange which resulted in a charge.", "Our second quarter revenue of $7.5 billion increased 8% sequentially, largely driven by the production group as a result of strong pressure pumping activity in North America land.", "Pretax operating margin only increased 175 basis points to 12.7%. Highlights by product group were as follows. Second quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.8 billion increased 9% sequentially, primarily due to higher international activities across its product lines beyond the seasonal rebounds in Russia and Caspian and the North Sea region.", "Margins of 17% were essentially flat. Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased 6% sequentially, while margin increased 278 basis points to 14.3%. These increases were driven by strong directional drilling activity in U.S. land combined with the seasonal increases internationally.", "Production Group revenue of $2.5 billion increased 14% sequentially, while margin expanded by 382 basis points to 8.9%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity and the pricing recovery in North America land.", "The Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was largely driven by higher sales in surface systems across all areas and increased valve and measurement activity in North America.", "Margins increased 61 basis points to 13.8% as OneSubsea margins exceeded 20% for the fourth straight quarter as a result of strong project execution. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses increased to 1.1 in the first quarter. This marks the first time these businesses have been above 1 since the fourth quarter of 2013.", "The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle businesses decreased to 0.8 in the Q2. Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.9% in the second quarter compared to 15.3% in the previous quarter. This increase was primarily driven by the increased earnings in North America.", "The ETR will continue to be very sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings between North America and the rest of the world. We expect the ETR will increase next quarter as North America continues to represent an increasing proportion of our earnings.", "In the second quarter, we generated $858 million of cash flow from operations. Working capital consumes approximately $550 million of cash during the quarter partially reflecting the growth in activity in addition to increased investments in preparation for the growth.", "Working capital also reflected the payment of $90 million in severance during the quarter. We remained very confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow target for the year during -- driven by a very strong performance in the second half of the year.", "Our net debt increased $1.2 billion during the quarter to $12.6 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $6.2 billion. During the quarter, we spend $398 million to repurchase 5.5 million shares at an average price of $72.34.", "We started off the second quarter with a higher rate of shared repurchases but reduces considerably as we progress on the EDC discussions, which will be 100% cash transactions. Paul will comment further on the EDC transaction.", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $500 million on CapEx and the investments of approximately $180 million in SPM projects. During the quarter, we also made $697 million of dividend payments.", "Full year 2017 CapEx, excluding SPM and multiclient investments, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.", "And now I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.", "Patrick Schorn", "Thank you, Simon. Looking at activity geographically we had a very strong quarter in North America with revenue growing 18% sequentially driven by increased activity from the unconventional basis in U.S. lands. Rapid deployment of our ideal hydraulic fracturing capacity and continued growth in our drilling related product lines all contributed to a 42% sequential revenue growth in U.S. lands.", "Hydraulic fracturing revenue increased by 68% sequentially significantly outperforming the 23% increase in the land rig count. We remain sold out for several of our key directional technologies as our customers continue to move towards more complex well profiles with longer laterals.", "Despite the significant costs associated with reactivating equipment and infrastructure as well as adding people all of our U.S. product lines were profitable in the second quarter. This was driven by increases in products and service pricing, improved operational efficiency, proactive supply chain management and the growing impact of our vertical integration investments around sand production and distribution.", "Cameron also contributes to our strong financial performance with higher product sales in wells and measurements and increased activity for our service systems product line. While we saw sequential revenue reductions from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and seasonally in Western Canada.", "Looking forward, we expect U.S. land activity to remain strong throughout the second half of the year with our frac calendar already fully booked well into Q4 and the high demand of our drilling services expected to continue. We are also on track to complete the OneStim joint venture during the second half of the year which will provide us with additional hydraulic horse power capacity as well as a full suite of multi stage completion technology.", "Internationally revenue increased 4% sequentially driven by growth in all geographical areas. In most geo markets, growth went well beyond the seasonal recovery from the winter slowdown.", "Europe\u2019s CIS and Africa revenue increased 6% sequentially, driven by strong growth in the Russia and CIS region where we saw the start of the summer drilling campaigns in Sakhalin together with continued strong activity in Western Siberia.", "North Sea activity was strong in both the U.K. and Norway as rig count increased and summer exploration work began. While the rig count stabilized in Sub Sahara and Africa as activity started to recover on land and with early signs of customers preparing to resume activity on key offshore projects.", "Revenue in Latin American increased 9% sequentially driven by solid activity and sales in Mexico and increased exploration and development work in Columbia. Argentina revenue was also higher on increased unconventional land development while activity in Brazil and Venezuela remained weak.", "Ecuador revenue was also somewhat lower sequentially however with the cooperation of Petroamazonas, Shushufindi production has now turned around and started to recover towards the end of the quarter.", "In the Middle East and Asia, revenue increased 1% sequentially as activity in Egypt, Iraq and the UAE remained solid. We also saw seasonal rebounce in activity in China driven by higher sales of completion products and services as well as our SPM gas project in the [Indiscernible] fields, while drilling activity and product sales also grew in Vietnam and Thailand.", "Next, I would like to provide an update on our SPM business and the rational behind their ongoing investment program. Today, most of the work we undertake for our customers continues to be contracted as individual products and services, and we do not see this changing in the foreseeable future. However, building on our broad technology offering and deep domain expertise, we have overtime also established significant project management and integration capabilities which we offer to our customers through more collaborative and commercially aligned business models.", "The SPM business model represents the ultimate alignment with our customers as we take on full field management of their assets risking the value of our product and services and sometimes cash and where we get paid a share of the value we generate from incremental production.", "Our first SPM project started in 2004 after which we have gradually expanded this business to each day we manage 15 projects in 7 countries. In 2016, our SPM business generated $1.4 billion in revenue and has over the period from 2011 to 2016 delivered return on capital employed which is around 700 basis points higher than the rest of our business.", "The SPM business therefore represents the highest multiple we can get on our technical capabilities and in addition these long term projects have provided a welcome full cycle baseline of activity, revenue and returns.", "Over the past three years we have seen a surge in SPM opportunities from both existing and new customers which we have decided to proactively pursue. This is by no means a desire to change the face of our company which will continue to be focused on market leadership in each individual product line, but instead SPM can create a baseline of activity to support our presence in the different geographies.", "We remain confident that despite our drive to expand our SPM business which has a different contract structure compared to our traditional business we are not significantly changing the risk profile of the company. That is because the biggest risk we continue to face as an oil field products and services company remains the cyclical nature of our industry.", "The SPM business although different in nature and contractual structure will in fact help dampen the impact of these cycles, provided the projects we invest in at the necessary full cycle robustness which of course remains a key selection criterion in all our evaluations.", "Through our ongoing investment program we expect to double SPM revenue over the next two years and overtime make SPM equivalent in size to one of our existing four groups.", "In terms of financials we have made a total capital investment of $4.3 billion in SPM projects since 2012 which represents less than 10% of our cash flow from operations over the same period.", "Our SPM investments are currently being amortized at an annual rate of approximately $450 million and the amortization schedules are periodically reviewed and adjusted to match project life and economics. The current investment in SPM projects on our balance sheet is $2.6 billion.", "In the last 12 months we have announced future multiyear investment plans of $390 million with YPF in Argentina and $700 million with FIRST E&P and NNPC in Nigeria. In addition, we have started off smaller projects with SM Energy in the Powder River Basin in the U.S. and with [Indiscernible] in Western Canada.", "Going forward, we will through a newly established venture funds look to access an increasing amount of external funding for our SPM business through the refinancing of existing projects where today we carry 100% of the project funding and by inviting financial investors to take a share in our upcoming projects.", "So in summary, our SPM investment program is focused on establishing a full cycle activity revenue and financial base line in many of the countries we operate in as well as on continuously providing accretive returns when compared to our base business.", "I will now turn the call back over to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Patrick. So next let\u2019s turn to the oil market where a sustained growth and demand continues to provide a much needed foundation for the outlook leaving little reason for concern over this part of the oil market equation.", "The supply side however is far more complex with market nervousness and investors speculation generally overshadowing facts and physical fundamentals leading to unpredictable movement in oil prices inspite of a third year of global under investment.", "The status of the global oil supply is best described by splitting the production base into three main block. First, Russia and the OPEC Gulf countries, second U.S. lands and third the rest of the world.", "The OPEC Gulf countries and Russia which combine make or close to 40% of global oil production remain fully committed to sound and consistent stewardship of their resource base. This is reflected in a steady increase in oil selectivity over the past three years as the world\u2019s best well at economics easily absorbed the significant drop in oil prices.", "These countries are also actively supporting the rebalancing of the global oil market by taking a procative role in moderating the current production levels. The other two blocks of supply are currently pursuing diametrically post directions to both investments and resource management driven by the respective stakeholders.", "The production level from the U.S. land E&P companies which currently represent around 8% of global oil supply is largely driven by the U.S. equity investors who are encouraging, enabling and rewarding short term production growth inspite of marginal project economics.", "The fast barrels from U.S. land are facilitated by a factory approach to both drilling and production and supported by a rapidly scalable supplier industry with a low barrier to entry. In this market the pursuit of equity appreciation outweighs the lack of free cash flow, net income and return on capital employed for both E&P companies and the service industry.", "And although the fast barrels from U.S. land have already cooled the oil price sentiments as well as the evaluation of the equity investments themselves, this has yet to limit the investment appetite for additional production growth.", "The last book of producers making up the rest of the world today represents over 50% of global oil production and covers a broad and diverse group of IOCs, NOCs, and independent operators. In aggregate, this group is for the third successive year highly focussed on meeting the cash return expectations of their shareholders whether these are equity investors or governance.", "The operators meet these requirements by striving to keep production flat by producing their existing outlets part of their normal and by limiting investments to what provides short term contributions to production at the expense of increasing deflection rates.", "These producers have also benefited from a production tailwind of 500,000 barrels to 700,000 barrels per day in each of the past three years coming from new projects where the majority of the investments were made in previous years.", "And with a low rate of new projects being sanctioned since 2014 this tailwind will taper off in the coming years. This harvesting approach is not uncommon for conventional oilfields that are in their last years of life prior to being shut in. However, this investment in stewardship model is sustainable for a vast resource space that is both expected and required to provide a substantial part of global oil production for decades to come.", "Needless to say, the longer the current under investment carries on, the more severe the cliff like decline trend will likely be when the producers run out of short term options to maintain production. And given the size of the production base, it would be difficult for the rest of the global producers to compensate for this pending supply challenge.", "So, how does this supply and demand situation translate into the current status of the oil market? Following the extension of the OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts agreed in late May, the oil markets and also included, we are expecting to see clear reductions in global inventory levels in the second quarter leading to a more positive sentiments in the oil market.", "Instead, oil prices and market sentiments became unexpectedly more negative driven largely by fear of oversupply from the growing production from U.S. land where investments and activity is booming. This increasingly negative sentiment is reflected in the oil markets interpretation of the latest industry data points. First the fact that oil to the inventories are coming down so much slower than expected is currently a major concern for the market, although inventories are still coming down and the drills are expected to accelerate in the second half of this year.", "And second, the fact that production from Libya and Nigeria has increased in recent months it is also a major concern for the market even though these countries were excluded from the production cuts because their production levels were low at the time of the agreement.", "What we are currently witnessing is that the U.S. equity investors and E&P companies have spooked the oil market investors into believing that the fast barrels from U.S. land will flood the markets and leave inventory levels elevated for the foreseeable future.", "Therefore their pursuit of short term equity returns from the U.S. land E&P stocks is actually preventing the recovery of the oil market and sending oil prices further down thereby eliminating any equity appreciation that the investments set out to create in the first place.", "So what does this mean for the outlook for oil prices and E&P investments? The latest developments in the oil markets has created more uncertainty around the shape and timing of the global industry recovery. However, the near to medium term market evolution will continue to be dictated by the following three factors. First, with the moderation and the investment appetite towards the fast but marginal barrels from U.S. land leading to a stronger focus on E&P financial returns and the need to operate within free cash flow.", "Second, with the key OPEC and non-OPEC countries extends the production cuts beyond the current nine month agreement. And third, with the emerging trend of a gradual investment increase in the rest of the world accelerate, develop mitigate or at least dampen the pending medium-term supply challenges.", "These three factors are somewhat interdependent and forecasting the forward part from the current market situation is at present difficult given the unpredictable and at times irrational behavior of the broader oil market.", "Still it remains clear to us that the current underinvestment in the rest of the world with increasing certainty create a mounting supply challenge over the coming years which will require a significant increase and acceleration in global E&P spend.", "At present we are seeing the first small signs of increasing investments in the rest of the world. However, the further evolution of this emerging trend will still be governed by the actions of the OPEC Gulf countries and Russia on one side and the U.S. equity investors and E&P companies on the other.", "New fund moderation from the U.S. producers combined with continued moderation from the OPEC Gulf countries and Russia should pave the way for a steady increase in oil prices.", "This in turn will provide an investment platform that will allow all three supplier groups to increase E&P spend to jointly help mitigate the pending supply issues. On the other hand, an absence of moderation from both sides could lead to further drop in oil prices which in turn would both accelerate and amplify the pending supply issues.", "In this market we continue to focus on serving our customers and driving on business forward by broadening our technology portfolio and increasing our addressable market by further streamlining our execution machine and by pursuing new and more collaborative ways of working with our customers.", "And in doing so we are maintaining a balanced coverage of the global oil and gas industry allowing us to effectively address current and future customer activity. This includes U.S. land where we today are seeing strong growth in both activity and service pricing.", "The OPEC Gulf countries and Russia already continue to see strong activity and a broad uptake of our entire technology offering, as well as the rest of the world which in spite of record low activity levels still represent over 50% of global oil production and we\u2019ll at some stage need to return to considerably higher investment levels even to just uphold current production.", "As part of our global focus we yesterday announced our intention to acquire a majority stake in the Eurasia drilling company in Russia. This extents the success for long-term relationship we have enjoyed with EDC through this strategic alliance we sign in 2011 which has enabled the deployment of a broad range of our drilling and well engineering services to our customers in Russia land.", "The pending EDC transaction together with our recent investment in a land rig manufacturing facility in Kaliningrad will further broaden our present infrastructure and capabilities used to serve the conventional Russian land drilling market.", "In Western Siberia, the land drilling contractors continue to have the leading role in providing integrated drilling services through turnkey models. And as the uptake of horizontal drilling continues to increase the deployment of integrated drilling systems through the EDC platform including our rig of the future, will allow us to bring new levels of drilling efficiency to our existing and new customers in this large market.", "So we are pleased to have reached this agreement with the EDC shareholders and we are already well advanced in preparing the regulatory filings required to complete this transaction.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "James West", "Hey, good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, James.", "James West", "So, thanks for the bit of your macro thoughts here. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on those macro thoughts in the oil markets. We\u2019ve seen a tremendous slowdown in equity issuance from the E&P industry in the U.S. which I know has been kind of a thorn in the side, if you will, of the oil markets and then of course you're talking somewhat about pick up internationally that coming somewhat sooner than we would have expected. How does this all play out? Do you think that investors as you talk to investors and certainly as you look at the market do you think that the whole, I guess, forgive the phrase shale game of share has kind of played out here in North America, the markets kind of picking up on the fact, there is no cash flow. Or do you \u2013 are you concern that this game continues for a while and so we\u2019ll kind of stuck in the mud?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think we talked about this before and this \u2013 the overall set up of the U.S. shale business where there hasn\u2019t been positive cash flow or positive free cash flow for what the \u2013 the last six, seven years. We have comment on that as that\u2019s being a bit of a surprise already. Now whether it will continue or not, I think its going to come down to two things, whether they can still continue to borrow going into 2018 and whether they continue to hedge.", "So I think today they still operate beyond cash flow, but I think the situation for the rest of the year is relatively set. So we expect to see steady increase in activity both in Q3 and Q4. What will happen in 2018? I think is a bit early to say. But as of now I think its still likely that we will continue to see strong activity in the U.S. in 2018 whether it will have the same type of growth rate we\u2019ve seen in 2017, that might not be the case.", "James West", "Right. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks Paal. And then with respect to the lower 48 especially given that we\u2019re recycling cash at these kind of oil prices and the well costs are continuing to move higher both as you and others raise pricing back to much more acceptable levels, although I know you probably still think they're not quite acceptable but they at least go in the right direction here. Where do you guys shakeout in terms of actual well costs where you can actually for an oil price basis make money in the U.S. market?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "From our standpoint, or from the E&P?", "James West", "E&Ps.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, it\u2019s difficult for me to say that. I mean you see a range of so call breakeven costs where some of the transportation premiums, the discounts to the WTI standard, the amortization of the infrastructure and land is not included. So, it is very difficult for me to say, but if you go back and look at both cash flow and profitability for most of the E&Ps in Q1 where the situation actually was quite favorable. There was limited pricing faction from the service industry and the commodity price were still high than what it is today. I think they were probably few of them even at that stage that really generated a profit.", "So, it's difficult for me to say. From our standpoint like we commented on in the prepared remarks, we are now profitable in all product lines. And we see continued growth in activity going forward in the next couple of quarters. So at least our business is back in the back and we are now obviously actively pursuing market share.", "James West", "Okay, good. Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, James.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ole Slorer", "Thank you very much. And thanks for shedding some light, Patrick on the SPM model. You said doubling this business over the next a couple years, does it mean that you\u2019ll double the $2.5 billion or $2.6 billion that you now have invested. And could you highlight little bit what incremental capital that would take. And also maybe \u2013 I saw in the NNPC agreement that there were some references to guarantees. And how do you go about getting guarantees when it comes to non-OECD players?", "Patrick Schorn", "All right. So, let me take a stab at that. So, firstly, we were talking about doubling the revenue that is what we said and clearly the longer term ambition remaining that we are growing at even further into the size what's today a group would be. The issue with these type of contractors that there is a variety of ways and how you can structure these deals and therefore the associated investments are actually quite different. It's very difficult to say that the basket of projects that we have today would be exactly the same type of basket that we have going forward and therefore the investments remain the same.", "What we\u2019re doing on a continuous basis is evaluating the overall portfolio of projects that we have. Look at the risks that we are having vis-\u00e0-vis certain partners, certain countries and certain investment level. So we\u2019ll continue to play that by year., And as you are very familiar with is that we\u2019re not only trying to finance these deals from our own cash growth, so looking to take in partners in the deals through our venture fund going forward.", "So I don't think that you can straight say, the amount of capital we had invested in the past is something we would double or quadruple going forward. That is certainly not the case. It\u2019s going to be a function of the type of projects that we take on. I think what is very clear is that the opportunity basket that we have today significantly larger than anything that we have seen in the past. Now obviously if you look at what have we learned in the years that we've done these type of projects is that there is a significant value in making sure that you are involved in the amortization of the hydrocarbon and therefore have a certain level of control when the cash returns back to where to us.", "And in more and more of the contracts that we have today, we are doing this through offshore escrow accounts, being very clear involved in the chain of custody of the hydrocarbon. And therefore that we know exactly when we get paid as this is sometime particularly in times of low oil price, obviously something that is more difficult. When it comes to returns and guarantees that you can get, clearly some of the projects that we have and kickstarting new business models in certain types of environments will require us to properly address risks that are potentially there. And therefore we have in certain of our contracts a guaranteed return that we would have on the investments that we make and clearly that allows us to go forward with these types of business models.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. And Paal, maybe you can tap in to some of that $100 billion of Wall Street, money that\u2019s been pouring into the shale and when it comes to tapping your E&P events, it sounds like your returns are little better?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, that was absolutely the plan, Ole, that\u2019s the plan.", "Ole Slorer", "Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll hand it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Ole.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Scott Gruber", "Yes. Good morning or good afternoon.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Scott Gruber", "So, speaking on SPM, James highlighted that there has been a slowdown in equity issuances by the domestic E&Ps and debt financing costs starting to creep higher, although they\u2019re not punitive yet. But given these trends and stagnant crude prices do you think there's an emerging opportunity for SPM in North America? It sounds like you recently signed a few deals? Are there more in the queue?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. Clearly, we have mentioned some of the deals here in our earlier remarks and clearly today there is an opportunity in North America for this business model because it is also allowing us to bring the appropriate technology into the shale plays that we have won it or into the tight oil and gas and therefore there is a increasing opportunity set also in North America and for that matter I would say that today we have opportunities in just about every geography around the world.", "Scott Gruber", "In other words, do you think if North America could become a material percentage of the book of business if you grow SPM to be its own reportable segment?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Absolutely.", "Scott Gruber", "I understand. If I could sneak one more in. You had significant restart cost in North America land this quarter. Are you to dimension how this falls off over 3Q and 4Q, so if we simply say that those extraordinary restart costs in 2Q were index that like one, where thus this figure head into the Q4, because its something like 0.7 and 0.3, I\u2019m trying to think about how those extraordinary costs roll-off over time here?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So we -- if you are doing the exit on Q2 I would say that Q3 will be pretty much 1.0 as well. We will continue to deploy at almost exactly the same rate and we expect to have all our total fleets of ideal pressure pumping assets in operation by early Q4. Now after that the startup cost will start to abate. It will come down in Q4 and going into Q1. But Q3 will see the same rate of deployments and unfortunate the same rate of startup costs. But we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making here and we have -- the rate of deployments that we have now in our pressure pumping business is unprecedented, we\u2019ve never gone at this rate before.", "Scott Gruber", "Great. Thanks for the color. I\u2019ll turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert", "Thanks. Good morning. Paal, you mentioned about the percolating visibility and an improved outlook for international driven by Russia and GCC, could you -- and also offshore FIDs. Could you elaborate on the nature of those projects, long cycle versus short cycle? And also interestingly reconciling, the increasing activity on the one hand on the part of Russia and GCC, but on the other hand keep in mind that they are effectively the fulcrum of the Vienna Accord. And I'm just curious as to how that tension interplays with each other?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Okay. Well, if I first look at the overall the international market in terms of the nature of activity. What we -- first of all, what we are seeing in most of the basins around the world takeaway as we say Russia and the OPEC Gulf, we are at unprecedented lows in terms of activity. So I think it\u2019s very natural that activity starts to come back. We were somewhat positively surprised at the rate it came back in Q2. It is not a dramatic increase. But it was more than what we were expecting from seasonality.", "And if you takeaway Cameron which is three, four quarters behind in the cycle compared to the legacy Schlumberger business. We grew the legacy business 10% sequentially in land, 8% in ECA and 2% in MEA. So these were numbers generally higher than what we were anticipating. So it is a combination I would say of land focus in all of the three reporting areas. But as we commented on this well, there are signs now of offshore project being prepared for FIDs and tendering, we see it in particular through OneSubsea business and a lot of this is tiebacks which basically the nature of that is going to be a lot more short cycle on the offshore business than what we\u2019ve seen in the past.", "And generally on land it is all short cycle as well. So, the lion share of the activity we\u2019re seeing internationally is short cycle, which is what you would expect where the operators are looking to minimize the time between cash outlays and production coming back.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay. And is there a threshold oil price when you discuss broadly speaking with your international client base that results in E&P capital spending growth or alternatively results in a continued stagnation. What\u2019s the dividing line between growth and a standing still?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We don\u2019t discuss the details of what their -- their decision-making is based on. Other than that we are very actively work with all customers in bringing cost to barrel down, whether this is offshore or on land. And given the fact that I would say a lot of the operators have been producing their assets quite hard over the past two, three years. I think there\u2019s a need to start replenishing reserves and also supporting production with more wells and smaller tiebacks and so forth. So, given the fact that this uptick has happened in the second quarter, but actually saw low oil prices than in the first quarter. I think this is more a general direction of the international production base.", "Most basins have unprecedented low activity and investment levels, and we seem to be coming off the bottom now. It will obviously supported more by higher oil prices, but there has been movement in the second quarter, which has actually seen a more negative oil price sentiment. I think that\u2019s going to turn in the second half of the year in the terms of sentiments, but the start of growth momentum, although still nascent has happened in the second quarter.", "Bill Herbert", "Thank you, sir.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Jim Wicklund", "Good morning, guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Jim.", "Jim Wicklund", "Paal, I don\u2019t disagree with you at all on the lack of return focused by the E&P industry. But onshore U.S. market is about the same size as the rest of the world added together. And so, if the E&P industry in 2018 were to live within cash flow, you\u2019d have to drop about 300 rigs in the U.S. The transition would be a higher oil price I guess and higher activity international. How do you manage for something like that considering the ramp up you had in North America in pressure pumping just over the last six months? If that were to happen is it a smooth transition for Schlumberger and it's obviously beneficial because your bigger internationally, but with everything that's happened is there a dislocation coming if that were to happen?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, first of all, I\u2019m not saying that that\u2019s happening.", "Jim Wicklund", "Please believe me \u2013 believe me, nobody is been able to rein in the E&P industry, so...", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Exactly. So, I think it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll see a major sort of tectonic movement here. But the fact that the industry in North America land continues to operate way beyond cash flow. I think that\u2019s going to be challenged if oil prices stay where it is. So that could mean for sure that the growth rate would slow. I don't think you\u2019ll see a significant reduction in activity, but I think the growth rate might slow.", "So I think there is still going to be possibilities both to land and potentially raise more equity, but in the event we continue at the current oil prices. I think the industry is going to be a bit more strain than what we have seen in 2017. Now, how we would manage that? We obviously \u2013 we are redeploying very actively our idle frac capacity. These are assets that we own already. And we are hiring people to operate them. And we are in a cyclical business. And it's a matter of adding proactively when you have the opportunity to catch growth and generate incremental. And if there is a headwind then we need to deal with it.", "Jim Wicklund", "Okay. And my follow-up would be -- and it just kind of occurred to me. Are we to the point yet in pressure pumping in terms of demand cost of reactivation et cetera, are we at the point in pressure pumping or Schlumberger is considering ordering new pressure pumping equipment?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No. We\u2019re not. We are very actively working on closing out OneStim JV with Weatherford with the DOJ. There has been some additional information from the DOJ which we are now providing them with. And we are obviously optimistic that we can close this during the second half of the year. And when that\u2019s done, we will have sufficient pressure pumping and a capacity to see us through at least 2018.", "Jim Wicklund", "Okay. Patrick, a question on year end of the business, you say that you\u2019re going to look for partners through the venture fund going forward. Have you already started soliciting partners for the venture fund? And what kind of partners do you want or expect to have?", "Patrick Schorn", "So, yes, we obviously have engaged with quite a few people in the financial world. We\u2019re working through a few banks focus on the variety of target groups that we are trying to look at, but it's mainly banks, family, offices, pension funds that are showing quite a bit of interest of being part of this. So at this moment a lot of these discussions are taking place, but as you well know there is a tremendous amount of money available looking for the right deal to be part of.", "Jim Wicklund", "Okay. Thanks guys. Good quarter. Have a good day.", "Patrick Schorn", "Thanks, Jim.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Paal, you all have given I\u2019d said, more time to sustainability this year than we\u2019ve seen in the past. I was just wondering if you could talk about sustainability just from a strategic standpoint and how its impacting cultures as well as potentially the way Schlumberger does business around the world?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we\u2019ve always been I would say focused on sustainability, the impact we have on the environment around us in terms of our operation, but also the positive impact we live in the various communities that we are part of around the world. What we haven\u2019t done up until the last couple of years is to really document this and put this together into something that we can present to governments, as well as to the investor base. And I think that\u2019s the main focus that we\u2019ve had now over the past few years.", "There\u2019s also a certain report and certain things that we do become part of in order to get certain certifications and rankings in terms of what our efforts are. So over the past couple years we have put that together into the report, which is then available both to local communities, governments and to the investment community where we really summarize and demonstrate what is long-term commitment is all about.", "And we understand the importance of this for the investment community for instance around what part of the investment community are interested -- invested in the company where the focus on sustainability is obviously a key decision criteria. So we\u2019ll see the importance of it. It's not something new that we started off. But we\u2019re taking the effort of putting together our efforts so there are much more transparent in summary.", "Michael LaMotte", "And so it becomes a key competitive advantage, do you think?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I haven\u2019t looked exactly what our competitors are doing here. What we are doing is something that we believe in and that we\u2019ve done for a long time. And I said the main thing we've done now is to just summarize it, and whether that\u2019s a competitive advantage or not. Maybe it is but we haven\u2019t done it for that reason. We\u2019ve done it because we believe in it and it's something in very worthwhile for us to do.", "Michael LaMotte", "Okay. And then, if I could just follow-up on the on the incremental margin question. When we have talked about 60%, 65% incrementals in the past for a country once it sort of reaches the inflection point of growth. Is there a growth rate that is really necessary to drive that kind of incrementals, I think about faster velocity driving some inflation perhaps acceleration of technology use et cetera. Is a slower growth trajectory I guess a struggle to achieve the kind of incremental margin?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think in the international markets, I would say whether \u2013 I mean -- if the growth rate there is higher, it would be -- I would say easier to generate higher incrementals. So we have a very good I think handle on the supply chain there. As we have in the U.S. as well, but the rate of inflation in the U.S. is always a lot quicker for significant activity increases. So, I would say that to get incrementals, higher growth rates would be -- would make it probably easier to do it provided that we have a good handle on the supply chain.", "But the key for the 65% incremental, so is that we need to have some pricing. And also those incrementals will kick in when we have kind of transitioned business from part of it basically being still in decline and battling some pricing issues. We need to firmly reach bottom in all aspects of the business and then start recovering from there including pricing.", "But the so far when we look at incrementals company wide for Q2 around mid-30s is I would say acceptable at this stage. I don\u2019t it's fantastic. And it's something that we have a very strong focus on going forward. And as we start to I would say, complete the last part of the bottom of the cycle, I\u2019ll expect that we get close to these incrementals that we had promised.", "Michael LaMotte", "Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "One moment please for your next question.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "If Kurt is not there maybe we can skip to the next one.", "Operator", "One moment please. Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "Can you hear me? Everything is good.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. Hi, Kurt.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay good. Paal, given the beat quarter and a general positive commentary in the press release and what you been saying here on the call. I\u2019m assuming that bodes well for some upside earnings revisions in the back half of the year. How do you feel about where Street numbers are right now if you look into the three quarter, fourth quarter this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, if you look at Q3 in terms of the business we expect to see continuation of the trends that we saw in the second quarter. So, for North America that means continued solid growth. We expect the rig count to continue to grow in Q3, although likely slow in somewhat in pace. We expect to see additional pricing and share gains in directional drilling and as I mentioned earlier we will continue to activate or reactivate frac capacity at the same rate as we did in Q2.", "Internationally, we also expecting to see a continuation of these encouraging signs we saw from Q2. We do expect single-digit sequential growth in ECA and MEA and actually most of the deal markets in these two areas will see growth we expect in Q3. But due to activity mix and some completion of projects we likely see a slight drop in Latin America in Q3. So, I would say, combining all of this I believe that the current Street consensus for Q3 is a good starting point.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay. And you know I think the stock is obviously creating on what expectations are for 2018 and then probably way too early for anybody to make that assessment for sure, but some of the commentary you had in the call today, you sort of paying say a more optimistic picture than when where sentiment is you know at this juncture. So what do you think the primary risk would be overall to an improvement in 2018 versus 2017 maybe you can give us some color, also maybe some benchmarks for us to look for in the back half of the year that would either give us more confidence or flag some additional risks as we look out to 2018?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes to comment on 2018, I think like you say is still too early. In terms of where we sit at the company and I\u2019ll comment on the overall in a second, but I think if you look at our position in North America land we have never been better positioned to capture growth both in the drilling manufacturing business. And internationally with some of the recent moves that we just announced plus the overall step out we\u2019ve had in total addressable market we are extremely well positioned to capture growth in every corner of the world as the global investment eventually will start to increase right.", "So, I will say the short term risk from the trends that we are currently seeing I think would be that, that there is still I would say issues around how the markets sees inventory gross. So far in July it\u2019s been very positive in particular in the U.S. and if this continues I think that should bode well for a gradual increase in oil prices in the second half of the year. But as a matter of how fast the U.S. producers are putting barrels on the market and also what\u2019s going to be important is what OPEC and Russia does you know come the end of the 9 month production cut period, right. So I think there is issues around or risks around how they interplay between the U.S. producers on one side and the Russia OPEC producers on the other side, how they play this out over the next I would say year or so, we are very clear in our view that you go 2019 and 2020 we are going to have potentially significant supply challenges.", "So the fact that global investments will come up in that period I think is very clear. What\u2019s going to happen in the period before we get there is going to come down to the plans of OPEC and Russia on one hand and the U.S. producers on the other.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay, great. All right, that\u2019s awesome. Appreciate the color, thanks.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Byron Pope from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.", "Byron Pope", "Good morning. Just had a question on SPM, so given the margin and returns accretive nature of your SPM work and the plans to double the revenue base over the next couple of years, could you just frame for us how you think about which of your three international regions in which you report revenues are likely to drive that SPM growth, I know you got projects in a number of different countries but I\u2019m just trying to think about it in terms of your three international regions?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I am disappointed but not going straight international. But I think that some of the very large opportunities that we see here at the moment and we are working on actively at this moment are actually right in North America. Apart from those there are significant projects coming up in discussion in the Middle East that might not strike you as the first place for SPM to take place but also there we have significant opportunities and apart from that it is going to be more of Asia, more of Africa those are the key type of areas that we are looking at the moment. But I don\u2019t think you can underestimate the impact that SPM can have on North America.", "Byron Pope", "That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jud Bailey", "Thanks, good morning. I had a follow up on OneStim if you don\u2019t mind. Paal, you mentioned that you expected for the Schlumberger equipment to be fully utilized by the beginning of the fourth quarter. As you look into 2018, as you acknowledge there is quite bit of uncertainty as to how spending budgets progress, how do you think about deploying the auto Weatherford equipment into that environment? Do you look for contracts, do you kind of force the issue and try to push equipment out or how do you think about reactivating that equipment in a more uncertain environment for next year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well I will say the following that the OneStim JV isn\u2019t focussed on the next couple of quarters. We did this because we have the medium to long term view on the North American land market. There might be challenges overall in terms of the volume of the market but I think there is still going to be a significant core that\u2019s going to withstand you know oil price challenges and still going to be profitable. And I think the combination of scale and efficiency and technology that we will bring and vertical integration is going to make OneStim very very competitive in any kind of market condition.", "So, obviously if activity was to flatten out for a period of time when you come early into 2018, then we will deploy what makes sense to deploy and the rest we will keep idle and ready for deploying later. So, we are not doing this for the next couple of quarters we are doing this for the medium to long term", "Jud Bailey", "Got it, okay thank you for that. And my follow up is just kind of following up on some of the offshore commentary. If we cannot stay in this $45 to $50 range for an extended period of time, how do you kind of think about the various pieces offshore, obviously you are seeing an uptick in FID activity, obviously everything shallow water activity continues to improve, but how do you think about deep water on kind of big projects towards on a longer term basis if we stay in this kind of environment for a prolonged period of time?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think if we stay in this environment for a long period of time, I think you will unlikely see large infrastructure projects whether it\u2019s a significant gap between cash outlays and cash returns, but I still think that even in deep water there are opportunities for tiebacks and utilization of existing infrastructure tiebacks using you know multiface pumps and so forth, right. So there are opportunities that we are seeing through one SubSea which actually isn\u2019t all concentrated on shallow water. There is a fair bit of deep water projects being considered unprepared for FID as well.", "So, but I think they are going to be all relatively short cycle in nature and we obviously we have a very bit position to participate in this and support our customers in getting those projects online.", "Jud Bailey", "Great. Right, thank you I\u2019ll turn it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "All right. So thank you for that final questions. I would now like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed this morning. First, we remain positive on the oil markets inspite of the current negative sentiments that have created more uncertainty around the shape and the timing of the market recovery. We believe that globally E&P investments will need to increase significantly in the coming years to address the pending supply challenges resulting from three years of under investments. And Schlumberger is uniquely positioned to capture growth in all markets as global investments start to recover.", "Second, we have shown you why we believe in the potential of Schlumberger production management to provide an activity baseline to geomarket operations that also delivered full cycle returns that are highly accretive to our business. And third we are continuing to build out our offering both in terms of technology and geography. The OneStim joint venture with Weatherford add scale and technology to our integrated production services in North America land while our agreement to acquire a majority stake in EDC in Russia offers significant opportunities to expand our presence in the conventional land drilling market in Western Siberia. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website.", "Finally, after our prepared remarks we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A period, in order to allow more time for others who maybe in the queue.", "Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Simon Ayat.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.42. This represents an increase of $0.07 sequentially and $0.17 when compared to the same quarter last year. ", "During the quarter, we recorded a $0.03 of Cameron merger and integration charges. Our third quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 6% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins increased 103 basis points to 9.2%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Third quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.8 billion increased 1% sequentially, while margin increased 56 basis points to 17.6%, primarily due to strong wireline activity, largely in Russia and Central Asia.", "Drilling Group revenue of $2.1 billion increased by 1% sequentially, while margins of 14.2% were essentially flat as directional drilling activity on land in North America continue to improve. ", "Production Group revenue of $2.9 billion increased 15% sequentially, while margin expanded by 62 basis points to 9.8%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity in North America land.", "Cameron Group revenue of $1.3 billion increased 3% sequentially, while margin increased 61 basis points to 13.8%. These results were largely driven by higher product sales in surface systems in North America.", "One, Subsea margins exceeded 20% for the 5th straight quarter. The book-to-bill ratio for our long-cycle business was 0.8 in Q3. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 18.4% in the third quarter compared to 18.9% in the previous quarter. ", "We generated $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations during the quarter. This included a federal tax refund in the U.S. working capital consume $134 million of cash, largely due to the increase in activity. Working capital also reflected the payment of $114 million in severance during the quarter.", "We remain on track to achieve our cash flow generation target for the year. Our net debt improved by $385 million during the quarter to $12.2 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $5 billion. ", "During the quarter, we spend $98 million to repurchase 1.5 million shares at an average price of $66.04. As we previously highlighted, we have reduced our buyback activity during the quarter in light of the pending OneStim and EDC transactions, as well as various SPM opportunity.", "Other significant liquidity events during the quarter included $600 million on CapEx and investments of approximately $165 million in SPM projects. During the quarter we also made $693 million of dividend payments. Full year 2017 CapEx excluding SPM and multiclient investments is now expected to be approximately $2.1 billion.", "And now I would turn the conference over to Patrick. ", "Patrick Schorn", "Thank you, Simon and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results were solid, driven by the strength of the North America land market and by growth in key international markets, like Russia, the North Sea and Asia. Elsewhere activity was largely flat sequentially.", "The quarter\u2019s performance was led by the Production Group, with strong revenue growth in North America, as hydraulic fracturing activity continue to increase. The Middle East also contributed to the growth of the group, through increased activity on unconventional resources development projects.", "Reservoir Characterization Group results were higher on solid summer drilling campaigns in Russia and the North Sea. Although exploration related activity worldwide remained very weak. The Drilling Group also improved, driven by stronger directional drilling activity in North America, which more than offset the completion of integrated drilling services project in the Middle East and Mexico.", "At Cameron, OneSubsea continue to deliver strong margins for the 5th straight quarter. At the same time, CAMShale fluid delivery and fracturing services are now deployed on about half of all Schlumberger fracturing job in North America realizing one of the targeted synergy benefits of the acquisition.", "Looking at North America in detail, revenue grew 18% sequentially driven by continued growth for both our production and drilling related businesses, with our hydraulic fracturing revenue increasing 42% sequentially. Over the past two quarters, we have more than doubled the number of active frac fleets in the North America and we have at present deployed close to all of our idle capacity in preparation for the additional capacity that will become available after closing the OneStim transaction with Weatherford.", "While the strength in our hydraulic fracturing activity combined with market share gains and continued pricing traction drove significant sequential revenue growth for the production group in North America land it also inevitably led to some transition related cost and inefficiencies resulting from the rapid ramp up in activity, which impacted incremental margins. However, this impact will abate in the coming quarters.", "The Drilling Group product lines also benefited from the continued growth in North America land rig activity in the third quarter. Demands for our advanced road restorable systems remained at sold out levels as our customers continue to move towards longer laterals. Given the demand for our drilling technology offering, we have ramped up manufacturing capacity and will dedicate more CapEx towards the North America land drilling market in the coming years.", "Before I comment on the international markets, I would like to update you on our SPM project in North America, where we continue to make in-roads in the third quarter. After one year of operations on the SM Energy project in the Powder River Basin, we are currently drilling and completing the 11th well. The production wells we have designed drilled and completed all produced in the top quartile of the field driven by optimized well placement and an engineered approach to completion and stimulation.", "Based on the success of the partnership between SM Energy and SPM, we are making steps to develop the business model further in cooperation, alignment and scope. As announced at the end of the second quarter, we've also secured a new SPM project with Torxen in Western Canada where we started up operation in August with four wells drilled so far. Yesterday, we announced that we together with our partner Torxen also have acquired a neighboring Palliser Block making this project the largest in scope within our current portfolio.", "The SM Energy and Torxen projects demonstrated the SPM opportunity set that is available to us in North America. These projects also show how we are effectively diversifying and building out our SPM portfolio from the initial start in Malaysia, Romania and Ecuador where we created the technical and commercial expertise that today serves as the foundation for this new and exciting part of our offering.", "Internationally, revenue was up 2% sequentially excluding Cameron where the long cycle businesses as expected are still seeing noticeable sequential declines. Europe/CIS/Africa area revenue was 7% higher sequentially including Cameron due to strong summer activity in Russia and Central Asia, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe and in Norway and Denmark.", "In Russia and Central Asia, land activity was very strong during the summer, driven by well construction services, wireline logging and artificial lift system sales. Russia is a strong market that steady adds reserves through the drill bits and our performance continues to benefit from the extensive investments we have made in the country in personnel, infrastructure, local manufacturing and support over the past 15 years.", "Activity in West Africa remained stable in the third quarter with limited additions to the rig count. However, project planning and tendering reached a two year high with new offshore project start-ups anticipated in early 2018. These projects are clear opportunities for our integrated drilling service product line and we continue to see an increasing interest for performance based drilling contract in shallow water including the jackup rig market.", "In North Africa activity remains low although we were able to return to drilling services and continue well intervention operations in Libya as security improved during the third quarter.", "Middle East and Asia area revenue was up 1% sequentially excluding Cameron as strong production and drilling group activity in the Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, Far East and Australia and South and East Asia GeoMarkets was largely offset by the completion of integrated drilling services projects in Iraq.", "Activity growth in Saudi Arabia was driven by improved productivity in our unconventional resources project, which enabled us to complete a higher stage count. However adverse weather which disrupted WesternGeco land seismic activity partially offset these gains. In Asia, activity strengthened in Indonesia on increasing rig count and market share, while Australia benefited from higher demand for hydraulic fracturing and drilling services.", "China improved with increased production services and higher seasonal activity and new technology deployments for shale and tight gas development. Revenue in the Latin America area decreased 5% sequentially excluding Cameron mainly due to lower multiclient seismic sales and the completion of integrated drilling services projects in the Mexico and Central America GeoMarket.", "Revenue in the North and South Latin America GeoMarkets was essentially flat with previous quarters with stable SPM project activity in Ecuador and as we prepared to start up our YPF SPM project towards the end of this year. As there has been a lot of attention around our SPM activity in Ecuador including recent reports with incorrect analysis and conclusions, let me close my remarks by clarifying where we currently stand.", "During the third quarter, we reached an agreement with our partners Petroamazonas and the government of Ecuador to settle our overdue receivable balance in the country. With the first payment milestones related to these discussions already completed during the quarter. Based on a joint review of the future development and investment plan for the field we've also revised the tariff relating to the Shushufindi contract and added a future severance payment guarantee.", "This was done to ensure that this long-term contract remains viable for both parties going forward. It is also important to point out that on a going forward basis the new terms of the Shushufindi contract still need our established investment criteria. At present, production from the Shushufindi field has been restored and is now in-line with the current reservoir performance potential.", "I now hand the call back to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Patrick. Before I comment on the business outlook, I would like to talk about technology. And in particular how we continue to build out our offering to create an unmatched upstream technology platform where the individual products and services has the industry\u2019s lowest cost of ownership and where the collective offering is readymade for broad-based system integration.", "This direction will first ensure that we become even more competitive in the markets where the prevailing business model is focused on lowest price for basic standalone products and services. And second, it will enable us to better serve the growing number of customers who favor integrated and performance based contracts, which is directionally where we see the industry heading.", "This includes extending our ownership of hardware, software and domain expertise into new market segments. As well as teaming up with companies like Google and Microsoft to capitalize on the latest advances in digital technology enablement.", "So what is the basis for our pursuit of technology system integration and why do we see hardware ownerships as a critical element of this strategy? Today the broad and complex EMP industry workflows are still predominantly enabled by discrete and fragmented products and services with the dividing lines between the various work packages defined by our customers contracting framework, which was established decades ago.", "These artificial dividing lines make sense at the time of creation when the technology systems were made up of a limited number of isolated hardware building blocks and the value of software and data was still nascent.", "With the complexity of today\u2019s oil field operations and the advances made in other industries in terms of total system performance, it is clear that replacing our industry\u2019s fragmented approach with a new focus on complete technology systems holds a massive performance upside.", "In response to this we have over the past seven years continued to build out our technology offering in terms of hardware, software and domain expertise. Where we today have the ownership and technical capabilities to develop these complete technology systems, driven by the following key beliefs.", "First, we believe that innovating across the artificial dividing lines of today\u2019s individual work packages to create hardware technology with a broader scope, a smaller footprint and fewer interfaces holds huge upside potential in terms of both hardware costs and performance. The way we are integrating and innovating around the drilling bottomhole assembly is an example of this. ", "Second, we believe that the next step change in industry performance will come from developing complete technology systems based on streamline and redefine end-to-end workflows, which integrates all hardware and software components. What we are doing with the rig of the future is an example of this. And third we believe that in order to maximize the performance of the EMP industry workflows it is essential to leverage the latest advances in digital technologies. ", "We achieve this by making these enabling technologies an integral part of the new hardware and software technology systems as opposed to attaching them on top of the outdated and fragmented technologies of yesterday. What we are doing with DELFI, which was introduced at the FAS Global Forum during the third quarter is an example of this. DELFI is our new cognitive E&P environment that leverages the latest advances in data security analytics, machines learning, high performance computing, as well as teamwork and collaboration to drive total system performance.", "The DELFI environment provides a new way of working for the asset teams by strengthening the integration between the technical domains and by enabling our customers and software partners throughout their own intellectual property and workflows through the system. With the launch of DELFI we have also deployed an E&P data lake on the Google Cloud platform comprising more than 1000 3D seismic surveys, 5 million wells, 1 million well logs and 400 million production records from around the world demonstrating a step change in system scalability.", "DELFI will ultimately cover all industry workflows however the initial focus is on drilling and well construction. In this respect the DrillPlan and DrillOps [ph] solutions will in the coming quarters be introduced to the market and this combined with our down hole hardware and the rig of the future will under the one drill offering create an unprecedented step change in drilling performance. ", "So this summarizes the strategic rationale behind our pursuit of technology system integration and also explains why we see hardware ownership as a critical element of the strategy. Our commitment to technology leadership is stronger than ever as can be seen by how we have advanced our technology strategy during the downturn of the past three years. We are now ready to capitalize on these investments in close collaboration with our customers.", "Let me next turn to the business environment where the reduction in global oil inventories in the third quarter clearly demonstrates that the oil market is now in balance, which is creating the required foundation for a further increase in the oil price and the inevitable growth in global E&P investments.", "And while the timing and pace of the pending industry recovery is still not completely clear we now see a number of converging market factors that make us increasingly positive about the outlook for our global business. First and foremost the growth in oil demand continues to be very strong and importantly the upward growth revisions in 2017 were primarily seen in the OACD countries.", "The demand growth outlook for 2018 is again expected to be north of 1.4 million barrels per day and is further supported by upward revisions in global GDP growth clearly suggesting that the demand side of the oil market equation is on a very solid footing.", "Looking closer at the global oil inventory, we also believe that the current situation is more positive than what is reflected by the market. Today global inventory levels are down to 64 days of forward cover and the North American stocks are already down to 2014 levels.", "Brent crude which is now in backwardation is seeing faster inventory draws and stocks are already approaching the five year average. In North America land where the E&P companies have added significant CapEx over the past year, the production growth is so far falling short of expectations, driven by supply chain inflation, operational inefficiencies and the need to step out from the Tier 1 acreage. This has led to a moderating investment appetite where the previous pursue to production growth is now being balanced out with an equal focus on generated solid financial returns and operating within cash flow.", "This moderation can be seen in the flattening trend of the U.S. land rig count during the third quarter and it is also reflected in our customers\u2019 2018 activity outlook. The more tempered activity outlook for U.S. land combined with the short cycle nature of the business has an immediate impact on the outlook for production growth, which for 2017 and 2018 has been revised down by 100,000 and 500,000 barrels per day respectively. This clearly has a material impacts on the global supply and demand balance.", "From the OPEC side compliance with the stated production cuts has been better than expected. At the same time comments from several of the key OPEC Gulf countries and from Russia suggest that an extension of the existing production cuts beyond the current agreement is a possibility although this may ultimately not be needed.", "Looking at the ongoing activity and investment levels in the international markets outside OPEC Gulf and Russia, we have so far seen very limited growth since we reached bottom of the cycle in the first quarter of this year. However, we\u2019re seeing signs in many parts of the world of conventional land and offshore projects now being prepared for FID, and the total number of FIDs this year is double that of 2016.", "It is also worth noting that our overall tendering activity in the international markets is also up by over 50% in 2017 compared to last year, measured in total contract value. And we expect these positive trends to strengthen further in the coming quarters. Based on the combination of all these factors, we\u2019re currently increasingly the positive on the overall outlook for our global business. It is still early to say what the specific impact on the 2018 E&P spend will be, as our customers are now in their planning process. But we do expect activity tailwinds in most part of the world in 2018.", "In the meantime, we\u2019re fully focused on delivering industry leading products and services to our customers, and we also remain opportunistic with respect to making further strategic moves to position Schlumberger at the forefront of the industry as the global activity upturn slowly, but surely emerges.", "Before we open up for questions, which will likely initially be focus on SPM, let me again reiterate the rationale and objectives behind our SPM investments, which has not changed over the past two years. SPM will not alter the phase of Schlumberger it will simply complement our core business where the objective is to grow SPM from the size of a product line today to the size of a group over the next five to seven years. Granted SPM has a different risk profile compared to our core business, but different does not mean higher.", "The biggest risk to our full cycle returns in the core business is first the huge cost of scaling up and scaling down capacity in an increasingly volatile business environment. And second, failing to adjust our business approach in some of the large, but commoditized land markets around the world. Faced with these challenges, we\u2019ve concluded that a strategy of doing nothing new is simply not a strategy.", "The SPM business model and contract duration significantly mitigates both of these core business risks, while in return we take on the reservoir risk and in certain cases higher counterparty risk. Our track record over the past 20 years of SPM activity shows that we\u2019re very good at managing the reservoir risk and we\u2019re also getting increasingly good at managing the counterparty party risk as demonstrated by how we have resolved the current and future payment situation in Ecuador.", "So, in short, SPM helps mitigate some of the major risks in our core business. At the same time, we know very well how to manage the new risk we take on through the SPM model to the points where we see SPM in combination with our base business actually lowering our overall risk profile rather than increasing it.", "In terms of returns, we have disclosed that over the past five years, the SPM business performance is highly accretive to both our operating margins and return on capital employed. So it should at least a crack at corresponding multiple to our core business. To realign our stated growth objects for SPM we are pursuing investments in new projects and the announcement made yesterday is in line with this strategy.", "Lastly, let me also point out that SPM remains a small part of what we do as a company. And that the core of Schlumberger continues to be focused on our technology leadership where there are currently a lot of exiting things happening.", "With that, lets open up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "James West", "Hey, good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, James.", "James West", "So, I'm going to skip SPM question, I\u2019ll let somebody else go after since I'm pretty comfortable there.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Very good.", "James West", "I know it returns accretive. What I wanted to talk about and you highlighted a lot of this in your prepared commentary is international, Brent at you closing on 60 here all market fundamentals clearly better than there were a quarter or quarter two ago, which market I know you don't want to get into numbers yet because it's budgeting season et cetera which international markets that are at basically rock bottom right now, do you see probably turning the fact that as we go into \u201818 and maybe the back half of \u201918-19?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Again, it's a bit difficult to say, but if we just go through the various parts of the international market, we were actually quite pleased with the activity we saw in Q3 in Europe, North Sea in particular as well as in Russia. The Gulf part of the Middle East remains also very solid. And then in addition to that you have Africa and Asia, where we saw basically flattish activity in Africa and we had some small encouraging signs of growth in Asia, while also Latin America was flattish.", "So, I would say going forward I still think that the markets that would lead is slightly going to be Russia, Europe with the North Sea and the Middle East, but there are some emerging positive signs I would say in Asia. While Africa and Latin America is still looking flattish as of now. So, early to say, but for all markets I think we are at bottom and the encouraging signs as I mentioned in the prepaid remarks is that the number of FIDs overall this year is up by about 50%.", "James West", "Right.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Lag on activity, but it's a positive sign as well as our tendering activity, which is also up in total contract value this year by over 50%. So, there are really encouraging signs to be seen.", "James West", "Okay, great. And then as we think about those markets that are now starting to show signs of life or will show signs of life here shortly is the pricing environment starting to finally stabilize out?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I mean as always every contract bid any part of the world is competitive. And there is still pricing pressure and pricing challenges for all the new contracts we bid, but I would say the downward trend of pricing is slowing significantly, which I think is in line with the fact that we see activity having bottomed and is probably starting to head in the opposite direction. So, pricing headwinds at this stage is not a huge issue for us in the international market.", "James West", "Great. Thanks, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, James.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead. ", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks, good morning guys.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Angie Sedita", "So, maybe we could start with a lob for you and further a softball, thoughts on Q4, your comfort maybe around consensus or anything you talked about at a high level on the revenue or margin side?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Right, so, for the Q4 outlook, we generally expect the continuation of the underline trends that we\u2019ve seen in the third quarter, moderated somewhat by seasonality. In North America land, we do expect to grow but I think the growth rate will slow, partly due to the flattening rig count, partly due to the fact that we have deployed most of our frac equipments and also the pending holiday season. So, I would say that some growth in North America land, but obviously not the same rate as what we've seen in previous quarters.", "And the international market we expect some modest growth in both EMEA and Latin America, but due to the winter seasonality likely a decline in ECA. I think also year-end sales this year will be low there is no real indication of anything significant. So if you look at the Q4 consensus as it stands today, it is potentially on the high end, but I think is a good target to work towards.", "Angie Sedita", "Okay, appreciate that that is very helpful. And then great to hear the positive sentiment around the international outlook, clearly your tone has changed and you're seeing has changed, but maybe just to hear quickly on Ecuador and Shushufindi with the restructuring of the tariff the thoughts on what the impact could be going into 2018?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Patrick do you want to handle that?", "Patrick Schorn", "Yes, so clearly we are very pleased that are in a more positive situation around the whole payment issue in Ecuador that has been largely resolved. Activity wise we expect to be fully focused again on maximizing production. And it is correct that we have had a change in the tariff, but it continues to be one of the heartlands of SPM that we have and where we have a business that we're very pleased.", "So we continue to have all the technical resources focused on improving the production levels as much as we can and where we're quite pleased with the opportunity that we have both the renegotiations in Ecuador. ", "Angie Sedita", "Okay, great. Thanks guys, I'll turn it over. ", "Patrick Schorn", "Thank you, Angie. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ", "Ole Slorer", "Yes, thanks a lot. I have two questions for you Paal, one is around Borr Drilling and the change in contracting model there. And the second one is the similar question on Cameron. But starting with Borr and in context of your comments that you are now seeing an increasing number of customers that are seeking performance, some kind of performance based contracting model that sort of breaks a little bit with the history of procurement and couple that with your view that this is sort of 50% increase in bid value. ", "Could you talk a little bit first maybe about how the reception has been from the drilling side of proposing performance based contracts? Is this something which is something that one or two your customers are now interested in or is it broader?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Obviously performance based drilling contracts has been established on lands quite a long time. And we see that the next I would say area that this will start growing is in shallow water. If you want to drill performance based, you need to have a pretty good handle on the subsurface and the drilling rigs. And given the drilling activity that you had historically on shallow water, this is again why we see this as the next horizon that these contracts will take on.", "So in terms of customers, we have a range of customers who are already pursuing performance drilling contracts offshore on shallow water. The main thing is that these contracts traditionally has not included the rig. So what we're seeing now is several customers are trying to bring the rig into play. And our rationale for investing in Borr is generally to get closer to one of the rig providers to try to drive this new behavior and establish performance contracts including the rig.", "Now our relationship with Borr does not preclude us from having similar relationships with all the other jackup providers. And we have engagement and discussions with several of them to do exactly the same there. So I would say it's a growing interest from the customer base. We have a several key customers who are already well advanced in trying to establish this and the main thing is that we need the rational drilling company and all the other well construction related services on the rig together with the rig provider to come together and establish a contracting framework that is benefitting all parties involved. And I think that's what we are trying to drive to our initial investment in Borr.", "Ole Slorer", "And it does break with the traditional way of contracting, so very much so, so I was just kind of looking for to what extent customers are really opening up to that type of debate.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I think it\u2019s fair to say that several key customers, I think are happy to never see rig day rates again, if they can get the entire drilling package, including down hole and surface on to performance based, I think that would be a benefit both for the customer and for the service companies involved.", "Ole Slorer", "Second question on Cameron, I mean, I think it\u2019s clear to everybody now that when you bought Cameron back few years ago, a lot of eyebrows got raised, and looking at the results now it\u2019s clearly something that if you believe that, I think, Cameron could\u2019ve achieved on their own. So, you highlighted CAMShale as one of success, can you talk a little bit about other areas where give us some examples of areas where Cameron is now achieving a performance that they wouldn\u2019t have not been able to do on their own. ", "I presume there are international markets that you\u2019ve opened up for valve for that type of thing on the subsea side where you continue to crank pretty hefty margins, we hearing about pricing pressure, but sometimes it\u2019s a little bit difficult to understand the difference between the pricing pressure and the lower cost solution. So, could you give us a few more data points around what you\u2019ve done with Cameron? And how far you\u2019ve come relative to what you had hoped for?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "First of all, Cameron was always a well-run company. And I think, what we\u2019ve done is, we\u2019ve brought in to our overall global organization and manage to take a well-run company, and together with what we can offer on this make one plus one equals three, that\u2019s the whole idea behind it.", "So, if you look at the various product lines of Cameron, obviously OneSubsea we have been involved with for a number of years already, and the momentum of that part of the business was already quite strong, when we took full ownership of Cameron. I think you\u2019ve seen in terms of tender win rates and the margin performance that the whole thesis behind what we try to achieve with OneSubsea is really working.", "On the drilling side, it\u2019s obviously a significant lull in the market, where Cameron drilling which was to a fair extent focused on the offshore market has seen a significant reduction in activity, but they\u2019ve done I\u2019d say an outstanding job in redirecting the portfolio and the capability set towards supporting our rig of the future efforts.", "And they\u2019re in the process of finalizing all the surface rig equipment packages as well as being more focused on the BOP side for land rigs as well. So I think we\u2019re really working very well together with the Cameron drilling side and rig of the future project to drive performance there.", "On the surface side, obviously the closer tied to our frac business, where we\u2019ve ramped up significantly in U.S. land over the past couple of quarters is a very good synergy and benefit. And I would say on surface international, there are some core very good markets for surface in the international market, but at the same time, there are number of countries and huge markets for the rest of Schlumberger, where there is very limited presence of surface and we\u2019re obviously attacking these as we speak.", "And finally on valves and measurement as well, very good, I would say synergies and performance up towards what we\u2019re doing with the early production facilities and Cameron processing overall. So, I think, all of the product lines are performing very well. I\u2019m very pleased with the management capabilities of Cameron and also how they are very seamlessly integrating with the rest of the organization.", "Ole Slorer", "Congrats on that both. I hand it back.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Ole.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Scott Gruber", "Yes, good morning. ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Scott Gruber", "Paal wanted to ask another question on SPM, with the growing book of business in North America, how critical are these projects to not only diversify the portfolio, but also showcase the various technologies and techniques that you can bring to the table to enhance production. During the prepared remarks Patrick mentioned the impressive results in the Powder River, are you at the point now where you can start the market results to other customers outside of the SPM initiative?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "To answer the last part of the question first, yes, within what is agreed with our customers, we can use this to market it. Again that\u2019s partly the background for Patrick\u2019s comments today and we\u2019re quite pleased with the performance of the project and the collaboration we have with SM Energy. So I would say that looking at the North America market SPM has an opportunity set in North America for sure.", "And I think both SM Energy and the talks are clear examples of that. Now the benefits we have in the North America land markets that we might not see in other land based fairly commoditized market is that scale really matters. So while we obviously we will look at SPM opportunities in North America getting scale behind our activities whether this is on frocking or drilling is also something that will help us perform better in these markets. But we are pursuing SPM in the North America land market as we indicated in our conference call in July.", "Scott Gruber", "But do you think the production enhancement benefits that you're delivering in the Powder River and hopefully in Canada. Do you think that can drive the broader sales effort in North America around your technologies and capabilities?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes absolutely, because I think what we are doing in these projects we can provide to other companies whether that is all the way from standalone products and services, consulting services, it could be also integrate and drilling services all the way up to SPM. So the main thing is the methodology and the principles of how we go about developing these reservoirs. And we are happy to engage with our entire customer base in the range of business models that we offer. ", "Scott Gruber", "And how quickly do you think that that benefit can materialize? I ask because I often hear investors comment that the E&Ps particularly the larger E&Ps go around to the energy conferences and actually discuss how they're less reliant upon big service companies to execute in the shale plays. But if you can go out on these SPM projects and really showcase production enhancement it would seem a strong counter to this narrative.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No that's fair. But I mean we are there to serve our customers. And if customers belief that they can do a better job without us then we will obviously try to engage with them and ensure them what we can do, but if their conclusion is that they can do it in a different way than we don't want to have an argument about that. I think there are plenty of customers who are open to kind of listen to what we do. ", "Some of them might be doing similar things already, in which case they may not need us. But I think there is a still a significant part of the customer base in North America land where we can have an impact. And that's what we pursuing.", "Scott Gruber", "Got it. And just a quick question on U.S. frac, the impressive growth during the quarter was that primarily just riding the growth plans with customers. Would you feel like you are often displacing less efficient frac companies that maybe experiencing some execution issues given the growth in the frac count?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Generally this quarter we have just continue to deploy along the frac calendar that we've already had established. Now there is as you continue to push pricing and as you know some companies perform better or worse, there is always a flux around what service company works for what customer. But generally we have been executing and implementing the targeted deployment plans that we already had established. So there hasn't been a huge move around replacing others as of this stage.", "Scott Gruber", "Got it, I'll turn it back. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Scott. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ", "Waqar Syed ", "Thank you for taking my question. My question relates to the Weatherford deal, could you appraise us of what the timing is on that deal and I understand there is a true up component as well. And could you comment in which direction the valuation could move on that deal?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I won't be able to go into the details of that other than the first priority that we have been working on is to obtain the U.S. Antitrust approval. And we work closely with the DOJ to get all the information to them that they require to make their decision. And we are optimistic that we will get the U.S. Antitrust approval during the fourth quarter.", "And as you mentioned, there are some ancillary agreements that we still need to work through with Weatherford. These agreements were all identified and laid out as we initially sign the deal. And we hope to be in a position to finalize these discussions and basically get all the agreements done by the end of the year. So going into any details of what those agreements cover and what we're discussing, obviously I won\u2019t be able to do that.", "Waqar Syed ", "Okay. And then just question on SPM investments in \u201818 based on the projects that you\u2019ve already announced, what level of SPM investments do you expect in \u201818?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Patrick.", "Patrick Schorn", "I mean obviously there is number of deals that we have announced depending on which particular project you look at whether there is production are not obviously the investment profile and whether or not that is generating cash from day one is quite different. Overall it is a business that we see growing and therefore we intend to continue to invest in it.", "So you should see a -- still an increase in SPM spending and it's all going to be a question of how many deals we do. I think that is important to keep in mind that we've obviously seen quite a few SPM deals continue in the last few quarters, it is unrealistic to believe that we are going to keep at this very high rate of deals continuously going forward, it is not necessary. ", "So, what you will see as well is that as time progresses more and more of the projects are actually going to be generating their own cash flow. So, that is really the way that we see it going forward, it is a growing business and we'll continue to invest, it really depends a little bit on what is the total makeup of projects that we have finally in \u201818 and we're still working on doing a few more before this year is over.", "Waqar Syed ", "So normally the run rate is around $150 million investments on a quarterly basis I guess that's the base level. So if for next year based on announcement should we assume more or like a $250 million kind of per quarter level, would that be reasonable?", "Patrick Schorn", "I think it is reasonable to expect that it is going to be somewhat higher. I don't want to give you a number right now.", "Waqar Syed ", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead. ", "Bill Herbert", "Thanks, good morning. So another question on SPM, could you talk about Patrick the mix of business going for the mix of investments, the mix of projects that you expect to invest going forward on SPM?", "Patrick Schorn", "Yes, so there is wide variety of things that we look at when we are taking SPM projects on. It is clear that we have had traditionally a fairly strong concentration in Latin America, which we wanted to make sure that we get a more global coverage, more in line with the overall footprint that we ask and where we see the opportunities.", "I think it is very clear that the way we invest in SPM is also related to where we have the strong footprint and where we have some excess capacity. Because one of the key things that we do in most of the projects that we take on is that we are investing in kind, meaning we are using our services to invest and get -- and earn a certain equity in the project.", "The bigger of a footprint that we have in a certain place the better we can use that to at a very efficient rate invest through our own services. So going forward, you should see us to more of a coverage of SPM projects around the world that is in line with our overall footprint and where we have largest Schlumberger operations, it is likely to have SPM opportunities as well.", "Now, going back to how we always have described SPM opportunities, it is the field that we are looking at where we are having an opportunity to do something different than what the current customer or owner of that field is doing. So, there is got to be a technical angle in which we see that we can improve what is currently being done. And we see opportunities today in just about every area, we see them in the Far East, we see them in the Middle East, we see them in North America.", "So, there is plenty opportunities at this moment and I would say think about more of geographical match where the Schlumberger footprint see us go a bit more into gas and I think that is probably the best way of describing it.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay. And then with respect to just staying on the SPM theme, again an improving kind of macro outlook and firming oil prices, that should lead to less of a need on the part of resource holders and less of a need on the part of Schlumberger given the fact that your asset employment for your global franchise should be improving, is that correct or no?", "Patrick Schorn", "That's correct.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay. And then finally, you mentioned it in your upfront commentary Patrick that there was a lot of noise around Shushufindi and a lot of miss information, can you give us the magnitude of adjustment on the fee per barrel with regard to this project?", "Patrick Schorn", "So clearly, as I\u2019ve described that we\u2019re continue to be very happy with what we have and I think that maybe the most important to take out of the commentary and how we describe the impact is that the tariff that we\u2019re having on Shushufindi still fully makes the returns and margin that we expect from an SPM project. So, that is probably as close as I want to get in giving you a bit color around the reduction that we have seen there. It is a project that we\u2019re pleased with and it fits very well within our portfolio.", "Bill Herbert", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Jim Wicklund", "Good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Paal, you were talking on Ole\u2019s question about performance based drilling and you do it now, but you haven\u2019t done it with the rig. Can you update us on Eurasia, because if I remember correctly one of the points of owning Eurasia was the prime contract on a lot of Russian situations as the rig owner rather than in the U.S. it\u2019s driven by completion, is that the case, is this a continuation of the trend and can you fetch us up where you\u2019re in Eurasia?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes the rationale behind the EDC transaction is exactly as we said or described it for Borr, this obviously happens to be on land in western sub-areas as oppose to shallow water, but it\u2019s exactly the same thing. It\u2019s about driving drilling performance through our down hole drilling technology through the rig technology, but also through the entire one drill system including DELFI as I described earlier in the prepared remarks. So, the rationale is exactly the same.", "In terms of where we stand, we\u2019re currently working through the requirements from the various Russian regulatory authorities, providing them with the information that they need to assess the application that we have to get antitrust approval. And I think the process there is moving along. We remain optimistic that we will get the ultimate approval, but our job at this stage is to provide the authorities with information that they need so that they can make their determination and their final decision. But, we remain optimistic that we will get this closed.", "Jim Wicklund", "Okay. My follow-up, if I could, we\u2019ve been asked this by a couple of investors, does the latest Canadian SPM investment in terms of what you\u2019ve done and what you\u2019re talking about doing, does that diminish the likelihood or magnitude of buybacks or dividend increases going forward?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I will say on the way we\u2019ve always planned to use our cash, the priority is always being to reinvest into the business, into projects and activities that are driving earnings and that are accretive to our returns. Beyond that, we\u2019ve said that we\u2019ll review dividends on an annual basis, and the balancing factor will always be buybacks. Nothing has changed to this effect.", "And we\u2019ll review dividends in January and we\u2019ll continue to be in the market to buy back stock, but we won\u2019t buy back stock at the expense of not being able to do what we think is right, in terms of driving the growth of the underlying business.", "Jim Wicklund", "Perfect. Thanks guys.", "Simon Ayat", "Let me add one thing about the Canadian project. The maximum cash exposure that we\u2019ve announced, which you see the basically the amount we\u2019re going to pay upon it is a maximum cash exposure, any future investment in the project will be mitigated by the cash flow that we will generate from the production of the projects itself. So, just to make it clear, the future investment in Torxen will be basically self-sufficient from the production that we\u2019re going to generate from the project itself.", "Jim Wicklund", "Okay, thanks guys it\u2019s helpful.", "Paal Kibsgaard", " Thank you, Jim.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "Hey, good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Kurt Hallead", "Question I had for you guys, you referenced the 50% increase in FIDs and tenders, so I think that\u2019s both in terms of number and then you mentioned contract value. I was wonder if you could give us some general size of that potential contract value and how you might assess your win rate on that contract value?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I don\u2019t want to go into what the exact volume is in terms of contract value, but if you look at our win rates, obviously all of these contracts are highly competitive, but I\u2019d say that I\u2019m at this stage satisfied with our win rate. Our win rate in 2017 is somewhat up from what it was in 2016, it continues to be competitive. But we\u2019re looking to balance out the pricing that we put into these contracts, which we will need to leverage for a number of years.", "At the same time having I would say the contract base and the growth platform we require to be in an optimal position as the international upturn starts. So, overall we\u2019re spending a lot of time making sure that we treat every tendering opportunity with a maximum amount of attention and I think so far we\u2019ve been quite successful in doing so.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay. And then your commentary around the tenders and the FIDs, you\u2019ve referenced both land and offshore, and then on the offshore front, you had some commentary about shallow water. I wonder if you give us some perspective on shallow water, deep water, what are you seeing between shallow and deep on the tenders and FIDs going into next year.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think it\u2019s pretty evident that the shallow water is going to come back a lot quicker compared to I would say an overall ramp in deep water activity. So this is again partly while we have our focus on shallow water both from a Schlumberger drilling services standpoint, but also teaming up with the jackup providers like Borr to make sure that we are in the forefront of securing the work on these rigs as they start to ramp up.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay. And if I may squeeze one last one in here, so your referenced Paal a hardware ownership being critical to your strategy going forward, hardware is very generic term. So I was wondering if you could elaborate little bit more on hardware is it rigs, land rigs, offshore rigs, is it just equipment. So, just wondered if you could elaborate little bit more on that hardware element?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, I agree hardware is a pretty generic term, but I would say that the current ownership that we have of hardware, I\u2019m pretty happy with it. So, we are not going in to take full ownership of jackup rigs or floaters, we are taking ownership of our own internally developed land rigs. But beyond that we want to have relationships with jackup providers and potentially floater providers. But our focus now is on the jackups, and we have no intentions what so ever of going back into full ownership of offshore rigs.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay, great, excellent. Thank you so much, appreciate it.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your final question today comes from the line of Chase Mulvehill from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Chase Mulvehill", "Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, first question, could you talk about the production margins in 3Q and the negative impact that you saw from the reactivations. Sounds like that some of that kind of comes out in 4Q, but maybe if you could kind of help us frame that a little bit.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, the production -- I mean, if you look at what is reported the main impact on the incremental margins sequentially for the production group is what we refer to North America land, where we have had a pretty significant ramp up, both in the second and the third quarter. And this creates inefficiencies internally in terms of how we deploy, how we hire and also how we optimize our distribution network for all the products that we need to get into these operations as well.", "So, some bottlenecks were experienced in the third quarter, and we are basically working through this now and they should generally abate in the fourth quarter and for sure into the first quarter. So, we\u2019re working through these things and I\u2019m not overly worried about it, but there are some things to be sorted out, which we are actively working on as we speak.", "Chase Mulvehill", "Okay, thank you, Paal. One quick follow-up, I\u2019m just kind of following up on Bill and Scott\u2019s question around SPM, when we think about SPM kind of an U.S. onshore, are you trying to take advantage of excess service capacity or is it more about kind of better of penetration of technology. And if it\u2019s the latter, what technologies do you think you\u2019re able to exploit through SPM that are not through your traditional businesses?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I would say in U.S. land it\u2019s generally looking to basically demonstrate what our technology and capability set can generate. So, this is all the way from well placement, drilling efficiency, frac placement and also overall how we complete these wells. So, it's most of these things we have generally talked to all our customers about already. ", "The main thing is the ability to put this together into consistently delivering top quartile wells, which I think we\u2019ve demonstrated through the example that Patrick descried today with SM Energy. So we\u2019re just looking to be more of that and that could be in the form of SPM, but like I said earlier to be in any form of whatever contractual engagement our customers are looking for.", "Chase Mulvehill", "Great. Thank you, I'll turn it back over, thanks Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "All right, thank you very much. So, as usual I would like to close with a summary of the major points that we have discussed this morning. First, we have overall past few years created industry\u2019s broadest upstream technology portfolio. Through the Cameron transaction a series of acquisitions, joint venture and partnerships with smaller technology companies and our own research and development efforts we have created an unparalleled technology platform, which is now ready for broad based system integration.", "Second, our long held views on the oil market are now being reinforced by data points that make us increasingly positive on the outlook and recovery for our global business. And last as the global E&P investments start to recover Schlumberger is uniquely positioned to outperform based on the strength of our technology portfolio, the capabilities of our global organization and the quality and the efficiency of the services we provide to our customers. That concludes our call for today. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.", "Simon Farrant", "Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted in Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting.", "Joining us on the call are Paal Kibsgaard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer; and Patrick Schorn, Executive Vice President, New Ventures.", "We will, as usual, first go through our prepared remarks, after which, we will open up for questions. For today\u2019s agenda, Simon will first present comments on our fourth quarter financial performance before Patrick reviews our results by geography. Paal will close our remarks with a discussion of our technology portfolio and our updated view of the industry macro.", "However, before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we\u2019ll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings.", "Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our full and fourth quarter press release, which is on our website.", "Finally after our prepared remarks, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up during the Q&A in order to allow more time for others who may be in the queue.", "Now, I hand the call over to Simon Ayat.", "Simon Ayat", "Thank you, Simon.", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.48. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and $0.21 when compared to the same quarter of last year.", "During the quarter, we recorded $2.01 of impairment and restructuring charges and $0.05 of Cameron and OneStim merger and integration charges. We also recorded a $0.05 charge relating to the enactment of U.S. tax reform.", "Of the $3 billion of pre-tax charges, approximately two-third relating to our exit from the seismic acquisition business and the write-down of our investment in Venezuela. Paal will discuss the background and rationale behind the exit of seismic acquisition business.", "As a result of the recent political and economic events in Venezuela, we wrote down our investment in Venezuela. Importantly, we will continue to maintain our presence in Venezuela, and we will continue to work to collect all amounts owed to us. However, from an accounting standpoint, we believe taking the write-down at this time is the right thing to do.", "As it relates to merger and integration charges, this will be the last quarter we call out this item separately. Further details regarding all of the Q4 charges can be found in the FAQ at the back of our earnings press release.", "Our fourth quarter revenue of $8.2 billion increased 3.5% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins increased 99 basis points to 10.2%. Highlights by product group were as follows: Fourth quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 7.5% sequentially as a result of a change in estimate on a long-term project accounted for under the percentage of completion, offset in part by higher software and multi-client sales.", "Margins expanded 441 basis points to 22%, primarily due to increased contribution from software and multi-client sales as well as the impact of the accounting from the previously mentioned project.", "Drilling Group revenue of $2.2 billion increased by 3% sequentially, while margin increased 43 basis points to 14.6% due to strong M-I SWACO sales in Mexico and North America land.", "Production Group revenue of $3.1 billion increased 7% sequentially, while margin increased 39 basis points to 10.2%. These results were driven by strong pressure pumping activity in North America land and internationally in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Argentina.", "Cameron Group revenue of $1.4 billion increased 9% sequentially, driven by growth in all product lines, particularly OneSubsea. Although margins for the group decreased by 58 basis points OneSubsea margins exceeded 20% for the sixth consecutive quarters. However, due to a decline in backlog, the OneSubsea margins are expected to be below 20% next quarter.", "The book-to-bill ratio for our long cycle business was 0.6 in Q4. The effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 19% in the fourth quarter compared to 18.4% in the previous quarter.", "Let me now provide you some color on the impact of U. S. tax reform on Schlumberger. As a non-U.S. company, our tax results is in us largely paying taxes where we work and earn profits without having to incur additional layer of taxes. Given the structure, the primary impact of U.S. reform on Schlumberger is that the lower federal tax rate of 20% will be applied to income earned by our U.S. business.", "Absent the impact of U.S. tax reform, our ETR likely would increase by approximately 2 to 3 percentage points in 2018 as compared to our Q4 ETR due to the higher profitability we expect in North America in 2018. However, the impact of U.S. tax reform is expected to largely offset this increase. As a result, we expect Schlumberger's full year 2019 ETR will be more or less in line with Q4 2017 ETR.", "During 2017, we returned $3.7 billion of tax to our shareholders through dividends and share buyback. As you know, our policy is to review dividend with our Board every January. Based on this review, we have decided to maintain our dividend at $0.50 per quarter. Paal will elaborate on this.", "We generated $5.7 billion of cash flow from operations for the full year 2017 and $2.3 billion during the fourth quarter. As a result, we achieved our cash flow generation target for the year. This is all despite making severance payments of approximately $455 million during 2017 and $108 million during the fourth quarter.", "I'm pleased to report that cash collection in Ecuador during the quarter were very strong. As a result, our receivable balance in the country at the end of 2017 was significantly lower than it was at this time last year.", "Our net debt increased by $900 million during the quarter to $13.1 billion. We ended the quarter with total cash and investment of $5.1 billion. During the quarter, we spent $101 million to increase - to repurchase 1.6 million shares at an average price of $64.82. For the full year 2017, we spent $969 million to repurchase 13.2 million shares at an average price of $73.11.", "And now, I will turn the conference call over to Patrick.", "Patrick Schorn", "Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone.", "Let me walk you through our geographical performance of the fourth quarter. Looking at North America, revenue grew 8% sequentially, driven by a further increase in land activity as well as improved pricing. This despite a 1% decrease in the frac market stage count. The Production Group OneStim hydraulic fracturing operations benefited from a full quarter of activity for the fleets we activated in the third quarter as well as additional fleets redeployments in the fourth.", "Profitability also improved as pricing increased. Vertical integration continued to reduce supply chain costs and the impact of transitory and reactivation costs abated. The Drilling Group sales of directional drilling technologies and M-I SWACO products and services increased sequentially as customer demand for longer laterals remain strong. Cameron Surface and Drilling Systems products and services were also in higher demand throughout the quarter.", "At the end of December, we concluded the transaction with Weatherford, most as a joint venture, as originally envisaged, but as a straight purchase of 1 million hydraulic horsepower. This deal will further enable margin expansion of the Schlumberger OneStim business in North America, a business we started over 12 months ago focused on providing an integrated completion of fracturing offering in young conventional market.", "The acquisition of these assets broadens and strengthens the OneStim footprint in the U.S., and we see outside ownership as a positive, not only through the flexibility and independence it offers, but also the seamless integration opportunities it brings with other products of our offering such as coil tubing and the Cameron service and frac flow businesses.", "The progress of the OneStim business over the past year is married by the success of new contract awards. For example, we have just signed an MOU with Oxy for a five year service partnership in the Aventine project in New Mexico's Delaware basin. Our joint objective is to reduce the cost per barrel in the safest and most efficient way possible.", "Pending final contract negotiation, the agreement includes a minimum scope of 700 wells, exclusivity of services and construction of a Schlumberger facility within the Oxy acreage. Offshore revenue in North America also increased as year-end sales of WesternGeco multi-client seismic licenses was stronger-than-expected.", "Activity in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico shifted to work over during the fourth quarter and will return to drilling in the first quarter of 2018, which includes activity on the Mad Dog 2 awards from BP for five to eight wells that we highlighted in this quarter's release. This award is in addition to the earlier awards to OneSubsea for the corresponding subsea installations.", "Internationally, fourth quarter revenue grew 2%. This was driven by strong growth in the Latin America area and a sustained growth in the Middle East and Asia area. These positive effects were partially offset by seasonal weakness in the Europe, CIS and Africa Area.", "In 2018, the international market will return to growth for the first time since 2014 and the projected activity growth is now leading us to start the reactivation of equipments to meet new contract start-ups. In addition to this, we're also starting to reposition equipment in the International Areas in general and to Russia in the Middle East, in particular, where activity is strongest and where we can secure the best returns. Both the reactivation and repositioning will result in increased short-term costs, which we except to absorb in the first quarter of this year.", "In Latin America, revenue increased 9% sequentially, driven by Argentina and Colombia. In Argentina, the growth was driven by Production Group activity for unconventional resource development with increased stage count and profit sales.", "In addition, we also began the first well on the YPF Bandurria Sur project. Drilling & Measurements in Colombia benefited from stronger activity for Ecopetrol. Revenue in Mexico and Central America was lower despite the growth in land development drilling works for both PEMEX and a number of local operators due to the absence of the strong multi-client seismic license sales seen in the third quarter.", "SPM project revenue was essentially flat in Ecuador, where we collected the further payment during the quarter, bringing the total receipt to $720 million, inclusive of the $300 million in bonds received from Petroamazonas that we monetized in December. We expect further payments early in 2019.", "In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue increased 2% sequentially on strong IPS project work in Saudi Arabia. Much of this was the result of improved efficiency and unconventional research developments but performance also increased on conventional loan security projects.", "Looking forward a little, we were awarded two new lump-sum contracts for drilling, rigs and services covering up to 146 gas wells and up to 128 oil wells. Project mobilization and start-up will begin in the first quarter.", "Elsewhere in the Middle East, activity was higher for Drilling & Measurements in Qatar and Kuwait, where IDS efficiency delivered additional wells. Also, as already mentioned, RCT revenue declined from a long-term construction projects in the region. In Iraq, signs of increased activity are emerging in the north with at least one major IOC expected to resume activity during the first quarter.", "In the south of the country, we have made further market share gains with additional awards of IDS contracts. With the onset of winter, activity was lower in the Europe, CIS and Africa with revenue declining a modest 2%. Seasonal effects were mainly seen in China, the North Sea GeoMarket and in Continental Europe, although these were partially offset by stronger SIS software sales and increased product sales from the drilling and production groups.", "Sub-Saharan Africa revenue declined with lower activity in Congo while in Libya, onshore drilling activity resumed us the security situation continues to improve. Weather in Russia and Central Asia region mainly affected wireline, although this was partially offset by record highway stimulation operations as well as sales of SAS software and Artificial Lift products.", "Secondly, it was also lower as the summer campaign ended, but completions high-end products sales mitigated this effect. The Caspian and Kazakhstan declined, although new contracts begin early in the first quarter were awarded for operations in both Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.", "Looking ahead, in other parts of the area, there have been a number of acreage acquisitions by international operators in Sub-Saharan and Africa on the back of record low reserve additions with development acreage changing hands. This will translate to new activity in 2018, particularly in Tanzania and Gabon.", "Some of these new projects have already less the new project awards that favor our integrated service capability. For example, we have just been awarded a services contract for an offshore project in Gabon to oversee well construction services. At the same time, Borr Drilling has been awarded the rig contract.", "We see alignment of this type as being one of the next steps in being able to provide more efficient drilling operations.", "And with that, I pass the call to Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you, Patrick.", "2017 marked the beginning of the oil market recovery with supply and demand moving into balance and oil prices steadily increasing over the course of the year. Our revenue grew 9% and ended up just north of $30 billion, driven by strengthening land activity in North America and by the Cameron acquisition, where we exceeded the synergy target start at the close of the transaction in 2016.", "Our approach through the past three years of unprecedented downturn has been to careful navigate the difficult commercial landscape, seizing strategic M&A opportunities, continuing the commitment to our transformation program and further broadening our extensive technology portfolio through organic R&D investments. Throughout this challenging period, we have continued to evaluate the effectiveness and competitiveness of all parts of the company and proactively restructure the elements we deemed necessary.", "In line with this, we took a further charge in the fourth quarter amounting to $3 billion and I would now like to give you the rationale behind the largest element of this, which is our decision to exit the seismic acquisition business.", "Given our history and market position, this has not been an easy decision to make. But following a careful evaluation of the current market trends, our customers buying habits and other current and projected financial returns, it is unfortunately and inevitable outcome.", "Geophysical measurements serve design and seismic operations have been an essential part of Schlumberger and our R&D efforts for more than 30 years. And today, we remain the industry seismic technology leader with a unique position in terms of intellectual property as well as engineering and manufacturing capabilities.", "Our IsoMetrix Marine acquisition system remains unrivaled and represents one of the biggest engineering achievements in the history of our company. Still has a downturn in the seismic data acquisition business now enters its sixth year.", "The present outlook provides no line of sight to a market recovery. It has also become clear to us that our customers are unwilling to pay a premium for our differentiated seismic measurement and surveys, and they clearly believe that generic technology and performance is sufficient. In general, this approach commoditize the seismic data acquisition business and creates a very low technical barrier to entry for smaller players, who steadily adds vessels and keep the market in a chronic state of overcapacity.", "We are therefore reached the conclusion that the seismic acquisition business cannot provide the full-cycle returns we require in terms of operating margins, free cash flow generation and return on capital employed nor can it compete for our internal allocation of R&E funding for capital investments.", "This challenging commercial environment is today clearly reflected in the financial statements of all the standalone seismic acquisition players, who are either at/or close to bankruptcy, heavily burned by weak cash flow and high debt.", "And while standalone seismic acquisition players have no other choice than to stay in and fight on to avoid bankruptcy while hoping for a better future, we, at Schlumberger, do have a choice, and we choose to exit the commoditized land and Marine acquisition business.", "Meanwhile, rapid advances and high-performance computing data analytics and machine learning have enhanced the value of seismic, imaging and visualization, enabling us to extract significantly higher value from our previous acquired data.", "Going forward, WesternGeco therefore adopts an asset-light model built on our strong multi-client, data processing and interpretation businesses, and further supported by our close partnerships with a leading company in cloud and high-performance computing. As a result, our reconstituted seismic business will going forward require half the capital investments and yield twice the free cash flow conversion and making it accretive to the cash returns of the company.", "In the coming quarters, we will, of course, honor all our existing land and Marine acquisition contract and customer commitment, but we have already stopped our participation in new bids. We are currently evaluating options for divesting our acquisition business and as we go through this process, we will call back our equipment as we complete our ongoing contractual commitments.", "Given the week financial state of the other seismic acquisition players and the absence of a clear line of sight to a recovery in the seismic market, we are prepared for the divestiture process to take some time and that we may end up selling our acquisition business to a new market entrant.", "Next, let's turn to the oil market, where demand amount outlook continues to be strong fueled by robust economic growth with the latest forecast showing upward GDP revisions in both the U.S. and Europe and with India continuing to surprise to the upside.", "On the supply side, the OPEC and Russian land production cuts were extended to the end of 2018 and more importantly, compliance remains at/or above 100%. This is translating into higher-than-expected inventory growth with U.S. stocks quickly approaching the five-year average and brent related inventories already well below. At the same time, floating storage has been more or less eliminated.", "All of this means that after a full year of waiting, the oil market is now substantially rebalanced. This is also reflected in the oil market sentiment, but we currently are witnessing a gradual shift from an oversupply discount towards the restoration of a market tightness premium with any geopolitical or operational disruption creating further upward movement in the oil price.", "In North America, shale oil production has responded as expected in 2017, with strong growth seen in the fourth quarter following the ramp up of drilling and completion activity earlier in the year. Looking forward to 2018, some of the U.S. E&Ps are still indicating that they will invest within cash flow in coming year.", "However, with a positive oil market sentiments and the increased availability of cash, we expect another year of robust growth in North America shale oil production, which will be required to maintain the balance in the global oil market.", "The reason for this is that the aging production base in Latin America, Africa and Asia continues to show underlying production decline after three years of unprecedented underinvestment.", "In 2018, this trend will again be marked by close to 2 million barrels of loan cycle production additions from investments made in the previous up cycle. These production tailwinds are expected to drop by around 1 million barrels per day in 2019, which means that the affected decline in the rest of the growth significant acceleration in 2019 and beyond even if investment levels start increasing in 2018.", "These positive oil market sentiments are also reflected in the E&P outlook, where the third-party surveys predict another 15% to 20% increase in North America investments in 2018 while the international market is poised for growth for the first time in four years with a forecast of 5% increase in E&P spend.", "From the Schlumberger side, we expect 2018 to be another year of strong growth in North America land, driven by further market share gains in both hydraulic fracturing and drilling as we deploy another 1 million horsepower and continue the capacity ramp up of our currently sold out rotary steerables and drillbit technologies.", "In the international market, we expect growth in all regions in 2018 for the first time since 2014. Spearheaded by solid underlying activity increases and market share gains in the Middle East, Russia, Asia and the North Sea while we expect more nominal growth rates in Latin America and Africa.", "The return to broad-based growth in international market represents a significant boost to our earnings power due to our unrivaled leadership position in all parts of this market in terms of both market share and profitability.", "The significance of it is best illustrated by the fact that we generate four to five times higher earnings for each incremental customer that was spent in the international market compared to the incremental customer dollars spent in North America. So after three very tough years, it is now clear that the tide is clearly turning in favor of Schlumberger.", "Moving closer at the first quarter, this will be a transitory quarter for us, where we expect the sequential decline in EPS to be $0.02 to $0.03 more than the normal seasonal growth. This is driven by the increased relative signs of our businesses in Russia and the North Sea, the need to absorb exceptional cost-related through reactivation of idle capacity due to recent contract wins as well as noticeable equipment repositioning cost as we shift more of our international capacity towards the Middle East and Russia.", "We expect to absorb the majority of these exceptional costs in the first quarter, and we are already seeing a strong acceleration in operating income growth in the second quarter.", "Turning next the capital allocations. We plan to tackle the 2018 activity growth without an increase in CapEx from the $2 billion levels seen in 2016 and 2017 as we again start to benefit from improved asset utilization on the back of our transformation program. These investments will be lower in 2018 as we focus on monetizing the strong library we have already bid.", "And for SPM, we have reached the end of our counter cyclical business development program and are now shifting our full attention towards project execution. This means that capital investment levels will be down in 2018 and that our SPM business will generate positive free cash flow in the coming year.", "In terms of capital allocations over its M&A activity, the only major transaction we are currently pursuing is depending EDC transaction and Russia, We remain optimistic that we will ultimately receive the needed regulatory approvals.", "As for dividends, we decided based on the current payout ratio to maintain our dividend at the current level for another year and instead return excess cash to our shareholders in the coming year through our existing buyback program.", "As we eagerly enter the first year of growth in all parts of our global operations since 2014, our entire organization remains committed to delivering market-leading products and services to our customers and superior returns to our investors, driven by our ability to win our customers work and deliver strong incremental margins and free cash flow.", "That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now open up for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James West from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "James West", "Hi. Good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, James.", "James West", "Great to hear your confidence about the international recovery and that getting underway. It looks we've already seen a little bit of that so far. I know Patrick outlined just a slew of contract wins that have already happened and I know that there's a lot of tenders out there, more are coming. It seems to be a global in nature.", "And you highlighted some transitory parts of 1Q, but how should we think about the rollout of international revenue or the contracts coming in and starting up as we go through 2018 and 2019? And kind of where do we see the inflection [hire] [ph] for international?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think if you look at the progression of 2019, I think I'll limit my comments to that. Like I said, the first quarter will be \u2013 we will see a lot of the start-up of these new contract wins. So in terms of revenue, we will have an impact of seasonality given the relative higher share of Northern Hemisphere business at this stage. And then it will be start-up cost and mobilizations that we're going to focus on in the coming quarters.", "So in terms of revenue progression, I think you will see the first quarter of significant acceleration in revenue in the second quarter followed again by a very strong growth also into the third quarter. So the year will have a somewhat slow start with seasonality with start-up costs and mobilizations in the first and then followed by strong growth in the subsequent quarters.", "James West", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then with respect to the first quarter, normally, there's about 10% decline or so for Schlumberger's earnings, yet that's in the normalized year-over-year, you have a lot of back and forth quarter sales and see the drop-off there. Should we think about something in that range? Or will it be maybe more of a pronounced decline at 1Q and then more of a jump in 2Q because of these staging and the preparation? ", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah, I think from an overall activity standpoint, I mean, we \u2013 I think about 10% reduction in EPS is a good benchmark for that. On top of that, we will have, I would say, two three additional sense of one-time costs lead to the reactivation as well as repositioning of equipment. But I think the 10% number is a good guide for the traditional seasonality with a couple of extra cents on additional costs.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Angie Sedita", "Thanks. Good morning, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning, Angie.", "Angie Sedita", "So a little bit of color may be on the evolution of OneStim in regards to Completions and started up how you'd like to build that business out over time, have a vertically-integrated business. What product lines are you missing? And what's the timeframe do you think you could see for that business to be built out to way that you would like it to well-rounded full product suite, et cetera?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So for the multi-stage completion business for U.S. land, we do have a more or less complete offering. There's a few small pieces that we're missing that we have. We're working on organically. But in terms of overall, we have the products that we need in the market. We have a presence in the market, although it is not very high.", "So what we are in full swing of doing now is to step up both supply chain and manufacturing as well as sales of this offering. And we will now tie it very closely to the deployment of additional horsepower. We obviously have ramped up significantly already in 2017.", "So we have a very aggressive growth plan for the multi-stage completion offering that we already have in-house, and we will look to penetrate significantly into the OneStim frac fleet that we already have in operation as well as the additional fleets that we will put into play in 2018.", "Angie Sedita", "Okay, okay, fair enough. And then the reference to SPM being potentially done. I mean, previously, you were commenting there could be as many as two to four project announced in the next one to two quarters. Now the oil prices have moved higher, transaction costs have like also moved higher. Do you still expect two to four more projects to be announced or are you done at least for 2018?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Patrick, you want to comment on that?", "Patrick Schorn", "Yes. So I think in general, Angie, SPM continues to be a growth engine for the company in the coming years. But at this stage, we have reached the end of what we call our countercyclical business development program, and we are really shifting our attention to project execution.", "Going forward, SPM will generate positive cash flow, and therefore, we'll be able to fund future investments and potential expansion. So I would really characterize this as a very disciplined growth going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Scott Gruber", "Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Scott Gruber", "Paal, with SPM being deemphasized to a degree with higher crude prices and you guys have made very good progress on the transformation, we started to receive a few questions from investors regarding what is Schlumberger's main growth strategy from here, what are the main initiatives to execute on that growth strategy?", "I have an answer, but given rising investor interest in Schlumberger and probably more people tuning into this call, I think it would be useful to if you just for a minute or two, from a higher level, if you could briefly discuss the overarching strategy of the company going forward and the key initiatives to execute on that strategy.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I would say that, if you look at what we've done over the past three years in the down cycle, we have two acquisitions, in particular, Cameron and through the combined I would say a number of small acquisitions within land drilling and organic investments, we have increased our addressable market with around 50%.", "So we have now a very complete portfolio within rest of our characterization, within all aspects of drilling, within all aspects of production, with an increased presence and U.S. land as well, and we\u2019ve added Cameron to the lineup in 2016.", "So our strategy going forward is very clearly that we want to now increase our market share, increase our participation in all aspects of the global business. We have a fantastic presence in the international market, which are now just returning to growth. And as I indicated in my prepared remarks, our earnings power internationally is four to five times higher than what it is in the North America land.", "So our strategy is very clear, it hasn't changed. We will continue to participate in all the major markets around the world. And we are very excited about the growth opportunities now that international is providing us. And again, the earnings power we have in these markets.", "Scott Gruber", "Got it. That's helpful. And then just with regard to the 5% market growth rate expectation in 2018, given the past investments in the SPM projects coming online, how do you think your international revenues trend relative to that market growth rate?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think, overall, our objective is to outgrow the overall market in any part of the growth, right? So I would say that if the international E&P spend growth ends up being 5%, our goal is to outperform it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of James Wicklund from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "James Wicklund", "Good morning guys. Paal, it's all positive in terms of the outlook. We all know that you guys and everybody else has said that international drilling activity had kind of bottomed mid-last year, but we're warned that pricing pressure continued. Has the pricing pressure abated any? And where is pricing today versus 2014 broadly in the international sector? And I guess, it matters most in Russia, Saudi and the North Sea. Can you talk about pricing internationally since spending is going to up in the rig count bottom that seems to be the most critical issue right now?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "It's a fair question, Jim. Obviously, we have a very clear view on pricing, and we have a very good handle on pricing. At this stage, I don't really want to go into what we think about pricing or how we're going to play pricing. This is very sensitive and very close to how we are running the business. So I'd rather keep those views to myself. Other than that, we have a very clear view on what they are doing w e are going to do going forward.", "James Wicklund", "Has it quick going down at least generally per industry?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I'm going not to stick to what is said. I think the overall in any part of the world remain competitive really at any stage of the cycle. The question is are you pushing pricing up, are you looking for market share? I'm not saying that we are doing either of those two things other than what we have a very good handle on what to do with pricing, and we view this as a competitive advantage through how we are going to perform in the market going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons. Please go ahead.", "Bill Herbert", "Good morning. Paal, if you could speak to the expected cadence of deployment and reactivation of the Weatherford frac fleet over the 2018 timeframe and then more over, if you could also speak to what you expect the total reactivation cost of the fleet to be as well and whether you expect all 20 of these fleets to be working by the culmination at the end of this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. If you look at what we did in 2017, we basically reactivated around 1 million-horsepower or slightly north of 20 fleets in 2017 of our own capacity. We are now more or less fully deployed, and we had challenges early on with the reactivation and getting everything out. There is a lot of hiring, there's a lot of new things to take on as to massively ramp up as we did. But at least, we have gotten the hang of it.", "So our plan is to do exactly the same in 2018. So we would be deploying the additional 1 million-horsepower over the course of 2018 and although it's not going to be a completely straight line, I think fairly close to a straight line over the course of the year, I think is a good assumption.", "Bill Herbert", "Got it. And do you have sort of gas I mean, I'm sure you've done work, but do you want to reveal it in terms of what you expect the reactivation cost to be?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. So for the horsepower that we bought from Weatherford, we expect the total reactivation cost to be in the range of $100 million, which is factored into our CapEx guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Kurt Hallead", "Hi, good morning. Thank you for all that color.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Kurt Hallead", "Interesting stuff going on here especially on the international front for sure. So Paal, a lot of focus and attentions on a very near-term numbers on the quarter I don't want to read too much into your commentary, but it sounds to me like the benefit you're going to get from the start ups post first quarter should more than offset the greater than seasonal drop in the first quarter.", "So on a full year basis, I'd have to assume that the street consensus numbers look pretty solid where they are right now. Can you provide some commentary on that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "We generally don't give annual guidance, so I'm not going to step into that. I would just reiterate my commentary that Q1 is transitory. We are not suggesting anything else than that. We have normal seasonal decline, we have some additional costs related to repositioning and reactivation, and we expect very strong growth in earnings, both in the Q2 and Q3 coming after.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay, that's fair enough. I appreciate that. So on the international front, you're mentioning that the earnings contribute 4 to 5x more than that in North America. Is that a true cycle number, Paal? Or you kind of comparing what was transpiring during the kind of peak activity levels for international in North America?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "No, this is the full cycle comparison of our North American operations versus our international operations, full cycle.", "Kurt Hallead", "Okay, great, awesome. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "David Anderson", "Hi, good morning. Paal, so you said in the past that doing nothing is not a strategy with the write-down in marine and seismic acquisition. So another move where you address your strategy on the business not meet acceptable returns SPM is the other obvious example. I was wondering if you could just kind of help us understand kind of bigger picture where you think Schlumberger's normalized returns should end up say compared to last cycle?", "Kind of excluding a big ramp up in pricing with your new kind of more asset-light model, can you get back to those levels? Are you targeting it back to kind of high teens returns maybe just kind of talk about just in general how you're thinking about that?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah, we are for sure targeting that. I think our goal is to beat the margins we had in the previous cycle and obviously peak higher and then whenever the inevitable next cycle starts, that we also profiler. So we have very clear plans in place for how we're going to do that both when it comes operating margins, when it comes to free cash flow generation as well as a return on capital employed.", "David Anderson", "And then one other thing if I could just go back to another comment you made in the past about not getting paid for technology in certain markets and therefore you pulled back until those customers come back to you. Has your mindsets changed at all on that? Have you seen shift from customers on how they're viewing technology today?", "I'm just kind of wondering how you\u2019re thinking about R&D spending over next few years. Obviously, came down quite a bit this year. How should we think about where that number goes for the next few years?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, we haven\u2019t changed our position in terms of wanting to get paid for our technology and in the markets where we are not going to get paid for our differentiated technology, we will provide market performance in those markets. Right? But I would say that the conversation is starting to shift in many of the markets around the world now towards technology, towards differentiated technologies and towards overall service and product performance.", "And this is, obviously, something that favors us. I think even in North America land, as we go into 2019, there is a growing focus from the customer base on both drilling and hydraulic fracturing efficiencies. So we want basically more well spots per rigs per year, and we want more stages per fleet per month, right?", "So all of these elements favors differentiated technologies, individuals technologies as well as our integrated offering, both when it comes to drilling and stimulation.", "So in terms of R&D spend, we have taken the R&D spend down gradually over the course of this downturn. We don't have plans for 2018 to increase it significantly, but we have plans in place in the following years as to what we would direct the spend towards when the market permits those to increase spend.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Igor Levi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Igor Levi", "Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Igor Levi", "So I remember early in the downturn when you were first giving international price concessions, you had mentioned that these concessions have mechanism of reversing when oil price trigger points were hit. And I know you don't want to provide details on pricing itself, but could we assume that with oil in the high 60s that some of those mechanisms are being triggered?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah. I think generally for those mechanisms, if you look at the bidding activity that we've gone through say over the past year and are still ongoing at this stage most of the contracts that those mechanisms were tagged on to are now being replaced by new bids.", "So I don't expect there to be a significant number of contracts where we still have those mechanisms in place that generally replaced by new contracts that have been competitively bid over the past year and it's still being awarded as we speak.", "Igor Levi", "Great. And how should we think about modeling the impact of your exit from the seismic acquisition business on 2018 results relative to what that business earned in 2017?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "I think if you look at the impact in Q4, there is some D&A impact. And beyond that, I think, obviously, it will be less capital intensive going towards. I would say lower CapEx, higher free cash conversion and some positive impact from D&A. Beyond that, that's it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Waqar Syed", "Thank you. Paal, my question is regarding the OneSubsea segments. One of the \u2013 your competitors have come up with more compact systems that can way sharply reduce customer cost. What's the Schlumberger's answer to this new introduction of new systems into the subsea?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, from the OneSubsea side, we have, over the past three years, done a lot on reducing the overall cost space and the capital intensity, the size on the equipment that we provide. So I mean this is nothing new for us, we've already made significant investments into this. We are quite competitive when it comes to all aspect of this, right? So this is already being going on within OneSubsea for a number of years.", "And if you look at some of the awards we've had in the past 12 months that's coming out as a direct consequence of being very competitive when it comes to cost and also standardization of the equipment that we're providing our solutions to our customers. So there's nothing new for us, we've already being working on this, and continue to work on it.", "Waqar Syed", "And what's your view on the outlook for offshore project FIDs with regards to primarily subsea orders, inventories or other subsea spending?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I don't have a specific number to give you on the number of projected fee awards other than that it set to be up in 2018. I think overall number of FIDs offshore as well is on the positive trend. So we are optimistic and excited about the offshore market as well as overall, the international market going into 2018.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jud Bailey", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Jud Bailey", "Good morning. A question on margins, Paal. With revenue growth probably old markets looks like they're going to be probably in the right direction next year. In the past, you've talked about generating \u2013 getting back to generating very high incremental margins in the 60-plus percent range.", "With revenue growth starting to turn the corner in most of your markets, is that still a reasonable expectation at some point in the future? And just in general, how should we think about incremental margins this year with the revenue growth probably going to happen from the spending that we see in your piece this year?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yeah. So for 2019, we target to increasing incremental margins in all aspects of our business around the world. I'm not sure that 65% incrementals in 2018 is that realistic because we will require a fair bit of pricing to reach those levels, but I've always said that 65% is achievable, good pricing.", "So we will have to see how the market pans out in terms of pricing. But absent pricing, I think it's going to be tough to get the 65%, but we for sure going to improve over the incremental margins that we delivered in 2017.", "Jud Bailey", "Is that still a reasonable goal if we continue to see growth in 2019, I guess? And I know you don't want to give guidance out that far, but just trying to get a sense that you'd still be once things are on we can get pass some activation cost and some of the transitory issues that the high incremental are something that you'd still be comfortable with a longer-term basis.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes, absolutely. We are for sure targeting the 65% incrementals when we got into steady growth, when we get a bit of pricing tailwind. That ambition have not changed, and we are going to work towards achieving. Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Timna Tanners", "Hey, good morning all. Wanted to ask if you could follow-up a little bit, please, on the SPM strategy. I appreciate that you're moving into harvest mode that makes a lot of sense. But can you help us with characterizing perhaps what might be the right investments were redeploying any of that cash and how we would look at those opportunities going forward?", "Patrick Schorn", "Yeah, it's maybe a little bit the same as what you already said. I think that we still believe that SPM is going to bed significant portion of our growth strategy going forward. But at the end, we want to make sure that we are very opportunistic in the deals that we bake. And at this stage, we have really reached the end of our countercyclical business development program.", "And going forward, we will be growing in a very disciplined manner. What that means is that we want SPM to be generating its cash that can use for future investment and potential expansion and that's \u2013 that is going to be the way on how we are going to be looking at project going forward. So SPM is key to what we do, and we have a very strong view on how we want to be investing our capital going forward.", "Timna Tanners", "Okay. I guess, you don't want to show your hands there too much. I'll shift to asking that question more to Simon about given the commentary about returning value to shareholders and buybacks and so on, can your mind as maybe some of your targets in terms of debt metrics and or cash on the balance sheet? Thanks.", "Simon Ayat", "So I think I won't \u2013 but no stopping \u2013 but you mentioned something about the cash on the balance sheet? This is Simon Ayat, by the way. Can you repeat your question, please?", "Timna Tanners", "So in light of the focus now on returning cash to shareholders and growth beyond the dividend, wanted to see if you could please remind us what your targets might be a regarding appropriate level of cash on the balance sheet and what your target debt metrics are? Thanks.", "Simon Ayat", "So you know our policy is to return capital through dividend and buy back. And we are in the market continuously on the buyback. From the remarks that I made, we spent almost $1 billion, we bought 13.2 million shares during 2017 and this has far exceeds the amount of shares we issued for the stock-based compensation.", "So our policy at the minimum, we will continue to buy back shares that we issue for the stock for the base compensation and any excess cash, and we will return it to our shareholders through buyback. The dividend policy is reviewed every year. As we said this January, we decided to stay at the same level and when the visibility is going to improve, we will certainly go back to increasing it. So our policy at the minimum is to return the shareholder any stock we issue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.", "Michael LaMotte", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, Paal.", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Good morning.", "Michael LaMotte", "When the OneStim was talked about as a joint venture, at one point you talked about operating fracs fleet as essentially two frac fleets or Schlumberger high tech and Weatherford base more conventional fleet vehicle, and I'm wondering now that you own 100% of it, these 20-plus incremental fleets this year, are they going to be more conventional spreads? Or are they going to have elements of the integrated field systems that you've been moving towards with OneStim?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I'm saying that for the underlying frac spread technology, we haven\u2019t talked about any kind of differentiation in that. I think the equipment that we bought from Weatherford versus the equipment that we generally have ourselves is more or less the same. I think it's much more down to water pumping, the fluid systems, diversion and potentially going more to an integrated model.", "But I would say today, we operate with basically generic fluid systems, and we have more or less the standard business model that the industry uses for us. So there's really no difference in the way we are operating any of the frac spreads within OneStim today and that's going to change from a take onboard the additional 1 million horsepower from Weatherford, right?", "So we are happy to provide more of an integrated package including both pump down perforating and multi-stage completions, and that's what we are going to be promoting in our contract with our customers, right? But for the ones that want to buy the individual pieces, we would continue to do that and that is still a lion's share of how we operate today.", "Michael LaMotte", "Okay. And then do you mind addressing some of the bottlenecks that you're seeing in the U.S. land market today? Obviously, labor is one that we hear a lot about, but I'm thinking more on the logistic side, in particular?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Yes. I think where the substantial growth that the industry has seen, and obviously, we have seen it and more so in the past year, and that's going to continue into 2018.", "There are bottlenecks in many parts of the value chain, right? But through diverse integration program, we have now been able to streamline a lot of the aspects all the way from the sand mind, to the railcars, to the transload and even then at the last mile through owning of fair bit of our own last mile trucking.", "So that's getting ironed out and I think the other aspect of challenges as well as that while the service industries has to ramp up their capacity and readiness, the same has gone for the customers. And I would say that there hasn\u2019t always been perfect synchronization in between our operations and customers where you get inefficiencies from waiting on water, waiting for the valve to be ready and so forth.", "So I think there's also a significant part of how we are going to be looking to try to streamline operations, to drive efficiency and further drive profitability in the year to come. But all of these things are in the works. We know where the bottlenecks are, and we have I would say active programs to address all of these in the coming year.", "Operator", "And your final question today comes from the line of Sean Meakim from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Sean Meakim", "Thank you. Good morning. So Paal with international activities set to improve you are losing some markets and you highlighted your core CapEx becoming flat again therefore still well below your core D&A. I'm just curious if you could expand on how much your efficiency efforts can continue to drive that lower spend? And what would it take for you in terms of the environment in order to really step it up meaningfully?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I mean, we're basically saying that we can keep our CapEx for field equipment flat in 2018 versus 2017. And it's began driven by the fact that we have in our view significant upside potential when it comes to the utilization of the existing asset base. So I don't see this as a one year benefit. We have this program going on, which I think will benefit those for a number of years going forward.", "So while I'm not going to make any prediction to field equipment CapEx for 2019 already at this stage, but for growth rate that are in the range of what we're seeing now, we can continue to do this for a number of years going forward.", "So we have significant capacity upside from the existing asset base, and we are going to try to drive utilization up and have a significant tailwind to our current capital employed by not having to spend a lot of CapEx on replenishing the field operation.", "Sean Meakim", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful feedback. And just thinking about North American onshore beyond pressure pumping some of the other completion and production service lines, how do you see the supply and demand and ultimately pricing for those other related product lines, cementing, core tubing even more pressure flow back break it here in your commentary there?", "Paal Kibsgaard", "Well, I think as activity will continue to increase, we expect to see growth and pricing opportunities for all the surrounding activities around fracking as well as on all aspects of drilling as well, right? And the last part, which we don't talk a lot about on these calls, is the Artificial Lift business, but we also have a very strong presence both when it comes to DSPs and price right? So for all aspect of our business in U.S. and going forward, we are very positive on both activity and pricing opportunity.", "Simon Ayat", "So thank you for that final question. I would now like to summarize the three most important points we have discussed this morning. First, the oil market is now balanced as a result of continued strong demand growth and the supply side characterized by production cuts, led by OPEC in Russia and the weakening global production base.", "So even the robust growth from North America shale oil production in 2019, global supply responses will be increasingly needed to balance the market going forward, which, again, means the return to growth for all parts of our business.", "Second, the positive sentiment in the oil market are already reflected in that 2019 E&P spend forecast where the third-party surveys indicate growth of 15% to 20% in North America and 5% internationally. This is highly favorable to Schlumberger as our international earnings power is four to five times higher than what we see in North America.", "Last, our approach the past three years has been to broaden our technology portfolio, leverage our transformation program and restructure our organization to be ready for the inevitable market recovery. We are excited about the outlook, and we are ready to deliver the best products and services to our customers and superior returns to our shareholders.", "Thank you very much for participating in the call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.
